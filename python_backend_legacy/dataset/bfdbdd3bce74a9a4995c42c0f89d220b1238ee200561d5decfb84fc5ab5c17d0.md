In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace (Robinson et al., 2012).\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare (Georgia, 2008) and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed (Joubert, 2010).\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace (OECD, 2012).\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures” (Alperovitch, 2011) and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” (Libicki, 2009).\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack (Libicki, 2009; Owens, 2009). On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare (Joubert, 2010).\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) (Walker, 2012). Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces (Lider, 1983).\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy (Robinson et al., 2012).\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain (Tuukkanen, 2010).\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes (Cederberg, 2010).\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks (Libicki, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012).\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks (Alperovitch, 2011).\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. (Libicki, 2009)\nEven though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset (Joubert, 2010). National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* (Owens, 2009). The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised (Libicki 2009). However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners (IBM, 2012). Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4.

Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern (Robinson et al., 2012). As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" (Krause, 1996).\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks (Libicki, 2009).\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 47\nfrastructure protection (Lehto, 2011). Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 (NATO, 2012).\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.(ACT, 2012). Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change (Geers, 2011). A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty (Grauman, 2012).\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine.",
  "flat_text": "# Adapting the Current National Defence Doctrine to Cyber Domain\nTopi Tuukkanen, Finnish Ministry of Defence, Helsinki, Finland\n## ABSTRACT\nThe current defence doctrine in Finland is analysed from a cyber perspective, and doctrinal tenets that adapt to the cyber domain as well as fundamentals that do not, are pointed out. In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace .\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare  and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed .\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace .\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures”  and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” .\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack . On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare .\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) . Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 37\nFigure 2. Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces .\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy .\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 39\nmay bring enhanced availability to users, system availability and reliability remain a concern. Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain .\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes .\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nIn the following, we shall consider these in more detail from the cyber perspective.\n## Deterrence\nIn chapter two, we learned that the national defence capability creates deterrence against the use of or the threat of using military force. Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks .\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks .\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. Even though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset . National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* . The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 43\nauthority to the military forces (supported by other authorities) to exercise surveillance and engage in defence of these parts of the network .\nIn theory, especially regarding some small-to-mid-sized nations as depicted in Figure 4, one might be able to define boundaries for national digital infrastructure at least pertaining to the physical layer (a more detailed description of layers is presented in a different section). Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised . However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners . Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4. Notional diagram of the submarine data network connectivity from Finland (adapted from Telegeography, 2012)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\na. Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern . As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" .\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks .\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 .\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.. Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change . A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty .\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine.",

    "# Adapting the Current National Defence Doctrine to Cyber Domain": "Topi Tuukkanen, Finnish Ministry of Defence, Helsinki, Finland\n## ABSTRACT\nThe current defence doctrine in Finland is analysed from a cyber perspective, and doctrinal tenets that adapt to the cyber domain as well as fundamentals that do not, are pointed out. In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace .\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare  and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed .\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace .\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures”  and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” .\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.",
    "# DEFINITION: CYBER": "From the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack . On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare .\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) . Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.",
    "# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE": "The word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces .\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy .",
    "# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE": "## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.",
    "# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009": "The Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain .\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes .\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.",
    "# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS": "## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nIn the following, we shall consider these in more detail from the cyber perspective.\n## Deterrence\nIn chapter two, we learned that the national defence capability creates deterrence against the use of or the threat of using military force. Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks .\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks .\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. Even though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset . National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* . The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 43\nauthority to the military forces (supported by other authorities) to exercise surveillance and engage in defence of these parts of the network .\nIn theory, especially regarding some small-to-mid-sized nations as depicted in Figure 4, one might be able to define boundaries for national digital infrastructure at least pertaining to the physical layer (a more detailed description of layers is presented in a different section). Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised . However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners . Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4.

Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).",
    "# Conscription and Reserves": "The Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"",
    "# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities": "In the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern . As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" .\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks .\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 47\nfrastructure protection . Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 .\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.. Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change . A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty .\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.",
    "## CONCLUSION": "While a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine."

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace .\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare  and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed .\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace .\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures”  and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” .\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack . On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare .\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) . Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces .\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy .\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain .\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes .\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nIn the following, we shall consider these in more detail from the cyber perspective.\n## Deterrence\nIn chapter two, we learned that the national defence capability creates deterrence against the use of or the threat of using military force. Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks .\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks .\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. Even though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset . National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* . The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 43\nauthority to the military forces (supported by other authorities) to exercise surveillance and engage in defence of these parts of the network .\nIn theory, especially regarding some small-to-mid-sized nations as depicted in Figure 4, one might be able to define boundaries for national digital infrastructure at least pertaining to the physical layer (a more detailed description of layers is presented in a different section). Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised . However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners . Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4. Notional diagram of the submarine data network connectivity from Finland (adapted from Telegeography, 2012)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\na. Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern . As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" .\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks .\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 47\nfrastructure protection . Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 .\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.. Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change . A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty .\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine.",

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace (Robinson et al., 2012).\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare (Georgia, 2008) and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed (Joubert, 2010).\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace (OECD, 2012).\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures” (Alperovitch, 2011) and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” (Libicki, 2009).\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack (Libicki, 2009; Owens, 2009). On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare (Joubert, 2010).\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) (Walker, 2012). Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 37\nFigure 2. Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces (Lider, 1983).\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy (Robinson et al., 2012).\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain (Tuukkanen, 2010).\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes (Cederberg, 2010).\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks (Libicki, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012).\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks (Alperovitch, 2011).\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. (Libicki, 2009)\nEven though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset (Joubert, 2010). National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* (Owens, 2009). The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised (Libicki 2009). However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners (IBM, 2012). Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4. Notional diagram of the submarine data network connectivity from Finland (adapted from Telegeography, 2012)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\na. Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern (Robinson et al., 2012). As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" (Krause, 1996).\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks (Libicki, 2009).\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 (NATO, 2012).\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.(ACT, 2012). Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change (Geers, 2011). A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty (Grauman, 2012).\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine."

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace (Robinson et al., 2012).\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare (Georgia, 2008) and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed (Joubert, 2010).\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace (OECD, 2012).\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures” (Alperovitch, 2011) and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” (Libicki, 2009).\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack (Libicki, 2009; Owens, 2009). On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare (Joubert, 2010).\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) (Walker, 2012). Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 37\nFigure 2. Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces (Lider, 1983).\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy (Robinson et al., 2012).\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain (Tuukkanen, 2010).\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes (Cederberg, 2010).\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nIn the following, we shall consider these in more detail from the cyber perspective.\n## Deterrence\nIn chapter two, we learned that the national defence capability creates deterrence against the use of or the threat of using military force. Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks (Libicki, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012).\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks (Alperovitch, 2011).\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. (Libicki, 2009)\nEven though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset (Joubert, 2010). National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* (Owens, 2009). The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised (Libicki 2009). However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners (IBM, 2012). Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4.

Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern (Robinson et al., 2012). As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" (Krause, 1996).\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks (Libicki, 2009).\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 47\nfrastructure protection (Lehto, 2011). Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 (NATO, 2012).\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.(ACT, 2012). Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change (Geers, 2011). A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty (Grauman, 2012).\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine."

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace .\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare  and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed .\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nsola, 2011). Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace .\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures”  and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” .\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack . On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare .\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) . Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 37\nFigure 2. Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces .\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy .\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n## Field Manual: General Part\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nin peace time as well as in times of tension and crises. According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain .\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes .\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\nFigure 3. Threat model of the security strategy for society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks .\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks .\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. Even though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset . National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* . The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 43\nauthority to the military forces (supported by other authorities) to exercise surveillance and engage in defence of these parts of the network .\nIn theory, especially regarding some small-to-mid-sized nations as depicted in Figure 4, one might be able to define boundaries for national digital infrastructure at least pertaining to the physical layer (a more detailed description of layers is presented in a different section). Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised . However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\nalready well defined among information security practitioners . Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\nFigure 4. Notional diagram of the submarine data network connectivity from Finland (adapted from Telegeography, 2012)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\na. Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n# Conscription and Reserves\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern . As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" .\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n## International Cooperation\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks .\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 .\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.. Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change . A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty .\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n## CONCLUSION\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine."

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised. Therefore, cyber domain has created\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

After the Gulf War, this notion was captured in the western world under the title Revolution in Military Affairs. It was later followed and complemented by the concept of Effects Based Approach to Operations (EBAO), which, however, has now been suppressed (Mäesalu, 2010). Parallel to these developments, the emerging internet technologies contributed to the rise of new war fighting concepts like Information Operations (U.S. Department of Defense, 1998) and Network-Centric-Warfare (Cebrowski &amp; Gartska, 1998).\nIn 2001, the US Department of Defence initiated the \"transformation\" in armed forces and by the establishment of the Allied Command Transformation, as the second strategic command within the NATO command structure, the Alliance is now formally following the suit. In addition to these, many nations have already identified the cyber domain as a 5th space of warfare after land, sea, air and space (Schreier, Weekes, &amp; Winkler, 2010).\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 Quadrennial Defence Review Report outlines that: \"The global commons are domains or areas that no one state controls but on which all rely. Future adversaries will likely possess sophisticated capabilities designed to contest or deny command of the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domains\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). This strategic view is further developed in the U.S. Department of Defense's Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, where it is quite clearly stated that: \"DoD will treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2011).\nOn the other hand, doubts have been expressed that cyberspace could not be characterized as a domain. However, current thinking\non the territoriality of cyberspace reflects that cyberspace is partly a human construct, partly natural and partly informational, but that the physical nature of its infrastructure permits territoriality to be exercised by the states. From this, legal norms concerning sovereignty, territoriality and jurisdiction apply to those elements which on their part constitute the cyberspace .\nThe rapid emergence and continuous change of underlying and underpinning technologies on cyberspace have presented armed forces with a number of challenges:\n- The late 90s dogma of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and complementing Network-Centric-Warfare have, by focusing on robotics and automation, rendered militaries vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n- Militaries have become reliant and dependent on cyberspace both for national defence as well as for expeditionary operations.\n- Cyber has been used in warfare  and also demonstrated in one-off incidents below the threshold of an act of war, but massive demonstration of cyber-power is still yet to come.\n- At nation-state-strategic level, the military is often poorly positioned to take the holistic responsibility of national cyber defence; in many instances the armed forces simply do not have the mandate or the authority to do so and often they also lack the resources and access to the very systems they might be expected to protect. Public-private partnerships and more agile administrative arrangements are needed .\n- Cyber capabilities present the small-to-mid-sized nations a possibility to alter present military status-quo in relative terms (Schreier&amp;Weekes&amp;Winkler, 2010).\nThe USA as well as Russia and NATO all recognise various forms of Information Warfare technologies as critical. These have also been identified as critical technologies to be closely monitored in the Finnish Defence Forces (Ko\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Thus, it can be argued that a cyber arms race is already underway (“Hyppönen - A cyber arms,” 2012).\nAs cited in Joubert (2010), Kramer, Starr, and Wentz argue in the ‘Cyberpower and National Security’ (Potomac Books, 2009) that cyberspace cannot, by the very nature of it, be controlled, not even by an international organisation. However, governments, military and policymakers are advised to take some necessary steps to develop an understanding of cyber issues facing their society. This observation was further confirmed in (Clemente, Cornish, &amp; Livingstone, 2010) where cyberspace was described as terra nullius, “currently beyond the reach of mature political discourse”.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted a comparative analysis of currently available cyber security strategies. The OECD suggests risk-assessments, evidence-based decision making and adoption of transparency principle to balance government-citizen-industry relationship in cyberspace .\nTherefore, one such step as implied by Kramer et al. would be the elaboration of a comprehensive national cyber strategy. That strategy should be derived from a theoretical framework that identifies current concepts and from which the national political objectives can be identified. One such effort to capture the framework from various national cyber security strategies is presented in OECD (2012).\nAs Joubert (2010) proclaims, “Cyberspace represents a new domain and strategists face the challenge to integrate its capabilities with other elements and instruments of power”. This notion has also been supported in some recent studies where findings “encourage integration of cyber into existing processes and structures”  and “a politico-military framework must be imposed upon it...” Clemente et al. (2010) suggest expanding current policies and processes to cyber domain. On the other hand, Libicki contradicts this by saying: “..cyberspace must be understood in its own terms and policy decisions being made for these must reflect such understanding. Attempts to\ntransfer policy constructs from other forms of warfare will not only fail but also hinder policy and planning” .\nCurrently a national cyber security strategy is being developed for Finland. Whether it will produce the theoretical framework from which it was derived from or whether national political objectives have been identified remains to be seen.\nThis paper is composed of four sections. Cyber, in a national security context, has already been introduced, and key terms, cyber and doctrine, shall be presented next. The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n\n---\n\n## ## CONCLUSION\n\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 49\nis used in a strictly military context and means the reactive/passive protection of military networks. Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\nInternational Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\ntional responsibilities this observation is both an obvious outcome and also a disadvantage. International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine.",

In most cases, current defence doctrine and fundamentals can be adjusted to cyber domain. Some need more research and planning, but also new legislation and organisational arrangements would be needed. As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.\n\nKeywords: Comprehensive Approach, Conscription, Cyber, Deterrence, Doctrine, Readiness, Sovereignty, Territoriality\n\n## CYBER AS A NEW DOMAIN?\n\nThe emergence of internet and interconnected systems has created an altogether new ecosystem, a domain that significantly contributes to our daily lives. Having revolutionised many ways by which we conduct our everyday tasks, be it in companies or in private; also new threats and challenges have emerged. Forrest Hare (2010) has analysed societies' vulnerabilities to cyber threats using Buzan's (1991) framework of power versus socio-political cohesion. Finland has traditionally had relatively low budgetary expenditures on armed forces in general, a relatively homogenous population, a strong national identity and a well-established and functioning political system. Therefore, based on the work of Hare, it can be argued\n\nDOI: 10.4018/ijcwt.2011100103\n\nthat Finland would be especially prone to military threats in the strategic-political sphere and to substantial cyber threats against critical infrastructure.\n\nAlvin and Heidi Toffler (1993) have claimed that any period of civilization – be it iron age, bronze age, etc., up to present information age – have introduced new means of waging war appropriate to the technologies available at that time. The older means of war fighting still remain, but the new means are additions to the toolbox available. Already in the contemporary “Information Age” we have already witnessed state sponsored (if not necessarily authored) attacks and espionage campaigns as well as attacks to internet services or attacks through SCADA-networks to inflict physical harm, although it seems that the full potential of the cyber domain in warfare has not yet been utilised.

The current defence doctrine as reflected in publicly available documentation is summarized in the second section. The most fundamental tenets of national defence are analysed in the third section in regard to their applicability to cyber domain. The conclusions are summarized in the final section.\n\n# DEFINITION: CYBER\n\nFrom the beginning, it must be noted that there is no universally agreed definition for the aggregate term “cyber doctrine”. Therefore, we need to look briefly into the definitions related to the cyber domain. In order to avoid reference to terminology or definitions that might be too closely tied to the national political, administrative, legal, or public/private constructs, we shall use the bilateral US – Russia terminology as defined in Rauscher and Yaschenko (2011):\n\nCyberspace is as an electronic medium through which information is created, transmitted, received, stored, processed, and deleted.\n\nCyber Conflict is a tense situation between or among nation-states or organized groups where unwelcome cyber attacks result in retaliation.\n\nCyber War is an escalated state of cyber conflict between or among states in which cyber attacks are carried out by state actors against cyber infrastructure as part of a military campaign\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 35\n\nCybersecurity is a property of cyber space that is an ability to resist intentional and unintentional threats and respond and recover.\n\nCyber Warfare is cyber attacks that are authorized by state actors against cyber infrastructure in conjunction with a government campaign.\n\nCyber Attack is an offensive use of a cyber weapon intended to harm a designated target. A cyber attack is defined by the weapon type and not the nature of the target. Thus, a cyber attack can be either a cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or a cyber asset. But a cyber attack is not a non-cyber weapon against a non-cyber asset or cyber asset.\n\nCyber Defensive Countermeasure is the deployment of a specific cyber defensive capability to deflect or to redirect a cyber attack.\n\nCyber Defense is organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack.\n\nBesides these bilateral definitions, one should note some nations have also developed their own interpretations and definitions of these terms. The NATO (2007) has slightly different definitions for cyberspace, cyber war, cyber attack and cyber defence. These definitions are rather old, and references (e.g., Robinson et al., 2012) already indicate that NATO has conducted further work to re-assess these definitions.\n\nEuropean Union as such does not yet have an union wide cyber security strategy (nor generally valid definitions beyond the community of interest in question), but that does not mean that EU would not have done anything in this area. For example, a recent study on cyber security prepared for the EU Parliament (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011) capture the bewildering array of closely associated cyber- and information warfare terms as depicted in Figure 1.\n\nAs Figure 1 depicts, there are three distinct disciplines: computer network attack (CNA), computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer network defence (CND) within the broader scope of Computer Network Operations (CNO). Although CNE and CNA are drawn\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Taxonomy of cyber related concepts (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011)\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\ntogether here, as they are undeniably hostile elements, they are legally and from countermeasures perspective quite apart from each other, albeit in some cases exploitation is a prerequisite for a successful attack (Libicki, 2009; Owens, 2009). On the other hand, Computer Network Attacks have been characterised as: “you can have an effective attack, a simple attack or have many targets – select any two” (Andress &amp; Winterfield, 2011). Secondly, the division or labelling an action or event is not always obvious. As Hutchinson (2007) notes, for example, deception is an element of information warfare and thereby confusing your opponent could be attempted through a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. It depends on the viewpoint and context whether information warfare, information operations, cyber warfare or computer networks attacks are used as the broader descriptive label.\n\nIt seems that currently the Chinese have the most sophisticated and well-developed strategic framework for information warfare (Qiao &amp; Wang, 1999). Within their thinking, defence-only approach is bluntly deemed “irrelevant” in the context of information warfare (Joubert, 2010).\n\nOver all, the terminology in cyber sphere remains relatively faltering as also reflected in Andress and Winterfield (2011). This situation was not alleviated by the US CYBERCOM representative who recently told the Multinational Experiment-7 audience, that US CYBERCOM has embarked on a process to redefine, re-scope and reassign cyber related tasks within what has been traditionally known as Computer Network Operations (CNO) (Walker, 2012). Such changes in US official stance cannot but influence also the terminology used elsewhere in the western world.\n\nIn Finland, approved formal cyber security strategy and doctrine are still missing. One area of concern arises from the definitions presented: namely the understood and agreed scope for the term ‘defence’ itself. Do we consider it as an inward turned, more or less passive/reactive measures taken to protect oneself as in Andress and Winterfield (2011) or do we use the term ‘defence’ in the broader sense as in organisational names “Department of Defence” or “Defence Forces”. More specifically for our forthcoming consideration of the doctrine, would this ‘defence’ refer to measures to protect military networks only, or would the military be tasked to support the protection of the networks of the society in general. The Figure 1, as well as Andress and Winterfield (2011), point more towards the former. The reader is advised that in the Finnish language, the adopted translation for Computer Network Defence has the meaning of “protection” (tietoverkkosuojautuminen), whereas the translation for cyber defence (kyberpuolustus) has a broader connotation that would include CND but also the network security and critical information infrastructure protection.\n\n# DEFINITION: DOCTRINE\n\nThe word ‘doctrine’ originally comes from Latin doctrina, meaning “instructions” or body of teachings. In the United States doctrine is defined as: “Fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application” (U.S. Department of Defense, 2012). This same definition has been adopted also by the UK Ministry of Defence (2011) and NATO (2007).\n\nMike Hough presents a thorough treatment of the term and definition of the word ‘doctrine’ with various considerations and variations in relation to closely associated terms like a concept and a strategy as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nHough explains that the diminishing role of doctrine at lower levels is to be found in the observation “no plan survives the first contact with the enemy”. Contrasting doctrine to strategy he cites Drew and Snow (1988) that the principal source of doctrine is experience but that it is constantly evolving as a result of new technology and changed circumstances.\n\nMoreover, it is pertinent to note that military doctrines are shaped by factors such as national goals and policies, the size of a military force,\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Notional relationship between doctrine and some other guidance documents\n\nthreat perception, and anticipated ranges of the use of military force. Deterrence is, however, in certain views, not part of military doctrine but a political concept. A basis for military doctrine is found in long-range national interests, perceived challenges to national security and missions of armed forces.\n\nThe current usage of military doctrine refers to “a system of views adopted by a given state as a programme for preparing and waging war, and the rationale of this”. In this context, military doctrine should include:\n\n- The concept of future wars,\n- The use of military force to prevent war,\n- The use of military force to wage war,\n- The use of military force in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces (Lider, 1983).\n\nFor the national cyber strategy work on going in Finland, it is also worth to note that doctrine influences strategy (or should influence strategy) and the results of strategy\n\nthen reinforce existing doctrine or initiate the development of new one.\n\nFinally, as the discussion on cyber terminology already implied, and as true cyber war is yet to materialize, a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy (Robinson et al., 2012).\n\n# PREVALENT DEFENCE DOCTRINE\n\n## Field Manual: General Part\n\nIn 2007 Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) published a “Field Manual – General part” to replace previous one dating from 1995 (Defence Command, 2007). This Field Manual contains three main parts. First part describes the context and national organizational environment in which the FDF operates. The second part outlines the threat models, tasks for defence and components of defence capability including peace time administrative and organizational principles. The third part describes in generic terms how the defence capabilities are to be scaled and used\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

According to the document: “This field manual defines the national defence structures and principles upon which Finnish Defence Forces operate i.e. defence doctrine”.\n\nAccording to the field manual, the membership in the European Union is the most significant channel of influence within Finnish foreign and security policy. Finland participates regionally and globally, bilaterally and multilaterally to the promotion of security in various domains and organisations. The Finnish course of action is based upon credible national defence, functioning of society, consistent foreign policy and active and strong participation in the international sphere. Within international peacekeeping the United Nations, the European Union as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are mentioned as elementary structures with which Finland co-operates.\n\nThe field manual highlights the general conscription as one of the fundamentals that facilitate the territorial defence of the whole nation as a part of comprehensive defence approach. Furthermore, its states that the centre of gravity or the focus within peace time operational planning will be in the “preventing and repelling a strategic strike”.\n\nBy their tasks and capabilities, the military forces are divided by type into regional and operational troops. For the planning purposes and flexible management of readiness, forces can also be designated by the anticipated tasks and phasing into:\n\n- Troops for preventing strategic strike before it takes place (i.e., during intimidation or coercion),\n- Troops for repelling the strategic strike,\n- Troops for repelling an attack to invade areas or parts of the country.\n\nBecause of the conscription and force structure reliant on mobilizing the reserves, the management of readiness is an essential function. The core idea is to flexibly and proactively maintain the readiness at all times above the perceived level of threat. Besides the force\n\ntypes already mentioned, different profiles are deployed to assign units and forces their respective Rules of Engagement (ROEs). These profiles can be flexibly adjusted according to the unit type and situation.\n\nThe Field manual recognises the importance of Information Warfare and Computer Network Operations, as the latter is clearly assigned as a task to the C4 Division of the Defence Command. Within the generic threat model of the Field Manual, Information Warfare is identified as one the means potentially to be used within broader hostile campaign of intimidation and coercion. Within the strategic strike, hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets whereas in territorial attack hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes.\n\n# Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009\n\nThe Government Report “Finnish Security and Defence Policy 2009” (Prime Minister’s Office, 2009) addresses international security developments, their effects on Finland as well as security and defence policy guidelines, finally concluding in the development lines for improving the security of Finland.\n\nThe paper restates Finland’s most fundamental foreign, security and defence policy objectives as: safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty, guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and maintaining a functioning society.\n\nAs to the technological developments having an impact on international security, the report finds that although global networks may improve resilience, they simultaneously increase interdependency that necessitates cross-border action to address preparedness and security of supply. Furthermore, deployment of modern ICT technologies facilitates the use of modern early warning- and information sharing mechanisms. Although wireless technologies\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Networked systems may bring cascading and disastrous effects.\n\nThe report recognizes that: “Military force is still used as an instrument in conflicts between states and in internal crises. The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use ... various means of information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare... Information warfare and cooperation between various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing volume of information and its relevance.”\n\nIn addressing the recent security developments in the regions close to Finland, the report admits that computer network attacks are a “tangible threat to security” and that the importance of electronic warfare and information warfare is on the rise.\n\nLarge portions of the report are based on already existing body of thinking, policy and approved strategy and doctrine. Recognizing some needs for adjustment, the report announced the government’s intention to initiate the review of the Strategy of Functions Vital to the Society. This updated report was published in 2010 and will be presented in more detail in the next chapter.\n\nFor our purposes, it suffices to note that the report endorsed the already well formulated fundamentals for the Finnish defence, namely:\n\n- Territorial defence and defence of the whole nation,\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance,\n- General conscription and large reserves,\n- Comprehensive approach and interauthority cooperation,\n- Unwavering will to defend the country,\n- International defence cooperation, and\n- Force structure of regional and deployable, mobile troops.\n\nEven though assistance to other authorities is one of the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces and a thorough list of various kinds of assistance is given, there is no mention whatsoever of any type of assistance even closely resembling activity in ICT - or cyber domains. In the section describing the indented lines of development as regards to Joint C2 and Joint Effects capabilities, it deliberately includes also non-kinetic technologies, albeit without any further details.\n\nThe report states that, as a militarily non-aligned nation, Finland cannot use foreign assistance as the basis for national defence planning. However, for example, Finland shall prepare for giving and receiving international assistance due to EU solidarity clause. Finland will continue the development of national defence capabilities according to the NATO standards in order to maintain interoperability and to be able to provide assistance most notably to international peacekeeping efforts.\n\nThe report continues that, within NATO, the Civilian Emergency Planning area has been opened to the partners and that Finland’s contributions in this area have proven to be valuable. This is an area where significant work on the cyber defences could be executed. For example, under the oversight of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finland contributed significantly to a critical information infrastructure vulnerability report by the NATO Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. Moreover, this stands as an example that even a traditionally military heavy organization needs to cooperate with civilian players in the cyber domain (Tuukkanen, 2010).\n\n## Security Strategy for Society 2010\n\nThe Security Strategy for Society (Security and Defence Committee, 2010) is a government resolution, which constitutes the common basis of preparedness planning and crisis management for all the actors in the society in normal conditions as well as in exceptional times.\n\nThe strategy is made from the point of view of the vital functions of the society that must\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\nbe secured in all conditions. Vital functions of society are:\n\n- Management of government affairs.\n- Psychological crisis tolerance.\n- Population’s income security and capability to function.\n- Functioning of economy and infrastructure.\n- Internal security.\n- National defence capability.\n- International activity.\n\nThe strategy also provides a common generic threat model depicting disruptions or disturbances that might endanger the security in society and its vital functions as depicted in Figure 3.\n\nFor our purposes, it is worth noting that even though cyber as such is not highlighted in the document itself, the custodian of the strategy document, the Security and Defence Policy Committee, has already acknowledged that cyber threats can cause or strengthen every threat in the model except natural catastrophes (Cederberg, 2010).\n\nThe strategy outlines that defence capability creates a credible deterrence in our security environment against the use of or the threat of using military force.\n\nThis capability is scaled to safeguard Finland’s territorial integrity, and preparations are made to defend the entire area of the nation and defences are implemented applying the comprehensive defence approach, sometimes otherwise known as total defence concept. Within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. Although Finland has traditionally adopted a policy of military nonalignment, the strategy postulates that the defence capability is maintained through networking on the national and international levels.\n\nDrawing from these, the strategy outlines, delineates, divides and assigns strategic tasks for various government ministries. As regards to the defence, the defence capability refers to readiness which is developed and maintained through:\n\n- Defence policy,\n- Co-ordination of the comprehensive defence approach and\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 41\n\n- Military defence, as well as\n- The ability to carry out defence tasks in all situations.\n\nThe strategic tasks assigned to the ministry of defence are as follows:\n\n- Monitoring and safeguarding territorial integrity,\n- Protecting society and its functions,\n- Preventing and repelling a military attack, and\n- Preparing to receive and use military assistance.\n\nThe principle of nationwide territorial defence is based on general conscription, a strong will to defend the country and international military cooperation. The emergence of threats must be detected early enough thus leading to the requirement for the compilation of a military situation figure to provide early warning and adequate preparation time.\n\nIn addition to the threat prevention, the repulsion capability requires readiness management and mobility of mobilized forces. At decisive points, the aggressor is repelled and defeated in a joint operation of all services. The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance and logistics increasing the effects of engagement.\n\nCrisis resilience and the security of supply in society are promoted by networking. International networking enables Finland to receive assistance, acquire materiel in a cost-effective manner and improve the security of supply.\n\nObviously, the MoD is also tasked to support the other authorities. These functions comprise executive assistance, participation in disaster response and support to an authority providing assistance to another state.\n\nSurprisingly the strategy makes a step ahead from the Government resolution of 2009 by stating that: “The defence capability is improved against cyber attacks” and continues that society’s vital targets are protected in cooperation with other authorities, not forgetting the specific role and mandate in legislation for the Border Guard, subordinate in the peace time to the Ministry of the Interior, but an integral element of the defence system and participant to the national defence in times of crises.\n\n# ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL TENETS\n\n## Summary of Current National Defence Fundaments\n\nChapter two presented the national defence doctrine, security strategy of the society and the most recent government report on the security and defence policy. Combined, these summarize the most important fundaments describing the Finnish defence system:\n\n- Credible national defence as military-political deterrence.\n- Military nonalignment.\n- Interoperability and capability to provide and receive foreign assistance, international defence cooperation and participation to the international peacekeeping.\n- General conscription and large reserves, unwavering will to defend the country.\n- Defence of the whole of the nation, territorial defence.\n- Territorial integrity and surveillance.\n- Comprehensive approach, support to other authorities.\n- Force structures divided into regional and operational troops that can be mobilized and deployed phase-wise as a part of flexible readiness management.\n- Information warfare is expected as a part of intimidation and coercion.\n- Related to a strategic strike, computer network attacks focus mainly on defensive military targets.\n- Related to a broader territorial military campaign, hostile cna focuses solely on defensive military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for hostile opponents own purposes.\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\nIn the following, we shall consider these in more detail from the cyber perspective.\n\n## Deterrence\n\nIn chapter two, we learned that the national defence capability creates deterrence against the use of or the threat of using military force. Generally, the goal of cyber deterrence could be seen as reducing the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost. There are, however, significant challenges as regards deterrence in cyber domain. Firstly, some forms of cyber attacks are possible only because systems have flaws. That is to say, one is vulnerable to cyber attacks only to the extent that one wants or allows oneself to be. Secondly \"operational cyber war\", meaning cyber attacks against military targets during a war, may have a significant although a niche role, and as such cyber war can only be a support function for other elements of warfare as, for example, outlined in the Finnish Field Manual. Thirdly, several aspects of attribution lead to deterrence being questionable. Finally, there are a number of factors to be considered when contemplating response options, e.g., retaliation to cyber attacks (Libicki, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012).\n\nTherefore, deterrence as a concept for retaliatory action would not necessarily be a sound basis for national cyber strategy or doctrine. We need also to note that it has been contested whether deterrence is actually part of any doctrine or is it more a political concept. But as Libicki (2009) points out, there is some leeway for cyber deterrence in support of a general military deterrence whereby the purpose of cyber deterrence would need to be formulated as to preserve the national defence forces' their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack. On the other hand, it has been suggested that cyber deterrence should focus on integrity and availability attacks (Alperovitch, 2011).\n\nGeneral defensive military posture, as a partial deterrence, can be emphasised, and it can be strengthened by a well defined organisational division of cyber tasks and mandates at national level. This would be complemented by systemic\n\nresiliency and robustness at various levels, as well as sound and well implemented protective cyber measures. (Libicki, 2009)\n\nEven though deterrence as a conceptual construct would not be such a strong instrument, one should nevertheless develop and be prepared to use cyber attack as a part of defensive toolset (Joubert, 2010). National cyber attack capability will in any case be needed for testing one's own defences, for training and education, experimentation and, obviously, for research and development.\n\n## Territorial Defence, Surveillance, and Integrity and Force Structures\n\nAccording to national defence doctrine, the defensive combat against an intrusion will be started from the borders. Regional forces will be used to slow down and to wear down the aggressor. The aggressor will be stopped and defeated in a joint operation at locations advantageous to the defender by the use of operational forces supported by other authorities and resources available in the society. Now, how this would translate to cyber domain?\n\nFirstly, we note that in such a case, the legal context would be *jus in bellum* but the problem of defining digital territory is just as challenging as for *jus ad bellum* (Owens, 2009). The current legislation regarding sovereignty, territoriality and surveillance thereof has developed with international legislative frameworks over the course of centuries, and as such there are a number of conceptual challenges to impose these notions to cyber domain. For example, how one defines a \"violation\" of territorial sovereignty in a digital context? Secondly can we, technically, from resources point of view or by attribution identify \"state\" and \"private\" data flowing in and out of our national digital infrastructure and still maintain freedom of speech and privacy of citizens?\n\nIt seems that there would be a need to draft a new and separate law which would define which parts of the digital society are to be considered critical to the functioning of society and furthermore that such legislation should grant the\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 43\n\nauthority to the military forces (supported by other authorities) to exercise surveillance and engage in defence of these parts of the network (Ekstedt, 2011).\n\nIn theory, especially regarding some small-to-mid-sized nations as depicted in Figure 4, one might be able to define boundaries for national digital infrastructure at least pertaining to the physical layer (a more detailed description of layers is presented in a different section). Even though national or even international legislation consensus on the concept of territoriality has not yet stabilised, Robinson et al. (2012) quite clearly points in the direction that sovereignty in the cyber domain can be and should be duly exercised (Libicki 2009). However, the boundary becomes more complicated in syntactic and semantic layers as many organisations and even government agencies are already using international and/or global ICT-services, some even \"cloud services\". In these cases national legislation would not necessarily be applicable.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"scorched earth\" tactics as depicted by the defence doctrine above can be translated to the cyber domain if we equate that with \"layered defence\" approach\n\nalready well defined among information security practitioners (IBM, 2012). Besides layered defences within individual network or organisation, such an approach should also be adopted among communities of interest and even nationally although a paradigm shift has been suggested from protecting the networks and controlling access towards protecting the data instead (\"Foreign spies penetrate US military networks,\" 2012). Moreover, the attrition by regional forces could be considered as an asymmetric combat along the lines of Liles (2010) although we shall consider the force structures next.\n\nForce structuring along above mentioned division into regional and operational forces can also be construed in cyber domain. Regional cyber forces could be considered as local information security practitioners within each of involved organisations (including government agencies providing information and communications technology (ICT) services) with the main task of defending their respective ICT environments, whereas operational cyber forces would be:\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 4.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\na. Government agencies coordinating or supporting the overall national cyber defences;\nb. Government and military intelligence agencies that conduct Computer Network Exploitation activities to support national cyber defences; and\nc. Military authorities that conduct Computer Network Attacks in defence of the nation (and in protection of own military capabilities for national defence, see the previous sections).\n\n# Conscription and Reserves\n\nThe Finnish defence system as a whole is based on general conscription and on the potential use of reservists (trained by military) in their respective assigned units and formations. Usually the only requirements for someone to be called into traditional kinetic military service are that the draftee be healthy and reasonably intelligent. In contrast, the cyber recruit would be called for his or her ability to bring specialised knowledge to support national cyber defences.\n\nIn kinetic military world issues like:\n\n- The selection and qualification criteria.\n- The question of activation and duration.\n- The use of intellectual property.\n- The use of own, employer's or government furnished tools.\n- The question of combatant status as per individual or as to his/her employer.\n\nare all well established in national and international law, but not so in cyber domain. Brenner and Clarke (2011) address the concept of conscription from the US legal perspective and uses the Estonian Cyber Defence League as a notional example. Although some of the issues are quite valid from the Finnish viewpoint, nationally and conceptually a distinction needs to be made and clarified between:\n\n- A conscripted serviceman or a called up reservist in a uniform using military capabilities during the war from military premises.\n- A cyber home guard / voluntary defence organisation member (based on civilian training and current post or expertise) using his or her private or employer's capabilities in peace time.\n\nA further challenge for the military is, that in Finnish system, the normal age the conscript is called up for his obligatory military service is around 20 years of age, when these youngsters have not yet completed their professional education. Using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations, like home guard, would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals especially useful for prepping up defences in peace time through exchange of cyber related information and best practices and by creating networks of trust based on personal relationships. As Brenner and Clarke (2011) point out, the establishment of cyber forces within the military as well as taking advantage of practitioners and professionals requires more in depth planning and preparation than general \"levée en masse.\"\n\n# Comprehensive Defence and Support of or to Other Authorities\n\nIn the previous chapter we learned that, within the comprehensive defence approach, the defence administration supports other areas of society and other authorities who in turn provide support to the defence administration. An intriguing question would be a case when cyber crime reaches a level or affects victims to the extent that it becomes a national security concern (Robinson et al., 2012). As cyber per se was not thoroughly assessed in Security and Defence Committee (2010), we need to take a closer look into existing ICT governance structures that we can assume to operate in cyber domain. To begin with, as of today, the functions of the government are deeply divided between ministries and agencies as defined by the Ordinance of the Government.\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 45\n\nObviously the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a relatively strong mandate to control and oversee the functioning of general telecommunications network. In this task, they are assisted by Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority as the host to the national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI.\n\nIt is less obvious that the Ministry of Finance and especially the Management Unit of the Government IT Operations has the oversight role over the common ICT functions. In this task they are assisted by the Government IT Shared Service Centre that develops and produces shared IT services for the government.\n\nThen, on the other hand, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy's (MoEE) sphere of authority includes inter alia industrial policy, energy policy and integration of the national preparation. Similarly as already described before, the assigned strategic tasks of the MoEE include: securing the fuel supply, safeguarding the electric power supply, food processing and distribution as well as safeguarding critical industries and services (Security and Defence Committee, 2010).\n\nSecurity of supply, emergency preparedness and the security of critical industries are\n\npart of the scope of work for the National Emergency Supply Agency under the MoEE. The agency and associated organisations like National Emergency Supply Council, sector and pooling organisation all aim to secure the functions of critical infrastructure of the society. For our purposes it is important to note that by this way, the Critical Information Infrastructure comes into Figure 5. NESA supports some of the activities of the FICORA in support of NESA's critical clientele.\n\nIf we consider national cyber domain as a matrix which is vertically divided into three layers and horizontally into columns as various functional branches of society (e.g., military, government shared services, government non-shared services, critical infrastructure, etc.), it soon becomes clear that in cyber, mandates and responsibilities are partly overlapping and partly missing altogether as depicted in Figure 5. Clear cyber strategic and political oversight, situation awareness and coordination seem to be missing too. Therefore the following quote is alarming: \"While it is true the private sector actors in most countries are critical to security in cyberspace, there can be no security in the absence of authority\" (Krause, 1996).\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 5. Notional division of cyber sphere into layers and functional branches of society depicting associated cyber accountabilities (layers adapted from Libicki, 2009)\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\nReference (Finnish MoD, 2007) states that the one of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. Such executive assistance is regulated in more detail in other legislation including, for example, support and cooperation with police, border guard, emergency services and oil pollution prevention. However, none of this legislation even remotely mentions any potential types of support or cooperation in the area of cyber defence or computer network operations, information warfare or cyber warfare. This absence is remarkable since according to (Finnish Government, 2006), the defence forces and other authorities do cooperate to prevent and repel various threats.\n\nIn the background are the legal obligations and inter-authority agreements (memorandums of understandings, MOUs) regarding cooperation. Besides traditional military threats, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, information warfare and threats to information systems are among challenges the defence forces closely monitor. The (Finnish Government, 2006) then continues with the justification mentioning, for example, efficient utilisation of resources and that this cooperation takes place at all levels of the administration. Cooperation in the normal times also creates the baseline for arrangements for cooperation in times of crises. However, a clear division on the civilian and military tasks must be maintained and military units participating to civilian tasks shall be subordinated to civilian leadership. Another notable aspect is that Defence Forces as an organisation may cooperate and support authorities in tasks which are not specifically named as tasks for the Defence Forces. However, such support and cooperation must be specifically pointed out in the legislation governing the beneficiary! Unfortunately, as of today, no authority or agency has named cyber support by the defence forces in their legislation.\n\n## International Cooperation\n\nA recent OECD (2012) report notes that different national cultures and styles of government reflect on each nation's division of tasks for cyber security and that this could pose a serious obstacle for a real-time cross-border incident management, even if single points of contact for international cyber security co-ordination were nominated. The report then speculates how international co-operation on cyber security will evolve in the short term. A potential course of action would be that each forum address and develop their cyber security measures based on the mandate and competencies within that forum and that members of various fora, even multiple forums simultaneously would encourage enhanced co-operation and partnerships between organisations with complementary expertise to avoid duplication of efforts and to enable synergies.\n\nTheoretically, the possibility for collective action has been seriously questioned in cyber domain, not the least due to attribution but also from the perspective of coalition partners being willing to expose their forensic intelligence and own vulnerabilities to other coalition partners as well as whether one's partners are ready to accept the forensic and/or attribution information by the attack's victim as provided. The challenge of collective action may also apply to active counter measures as denying connectivity from the original attacker. A collective counter offensive also would not be easy, but there remains a significant space for cooperation between likeminded parties especially to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially interconnection of different and/or automated sensor networks (Libicki, 2009).\n\nNevertheless, for the military EU and NATO stand as the foremost organisations with whom cooperation in cyber domain should be considered. The EU has so far been focused on cyber crime and critical information in-\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011 47\n\nfrastructure protection (Lehto, 2011). Within EU the cyber activities are dispersed upon a wide variety of actors among EU institutions. European Commission, European Council, European External Action Service, European Defence Agency and European Network and Information Security Agency all have a mandate and remit to address parts of the cyber security issue. Various EU bodies have recognised this dispersed approach to the cyber security (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). Therefore, the EU has only recently embarked to develop an EU wide cyber security strategy that should be completed in the autumn of 2012.\n\nWithin the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff is responsible for organising the lessons learned process to capture observations from EU led operations. It seems that within the Common Security and Defence Policy, the EUNAVFOR Atalanta, the operation off the Somalia coast and Horn of Africa has forced EU military planners to engage with non-military communities in ways not anticipated before (e.g., MSCHOA-website) and that this in turn has exposed the EUMS planning to cyber threats experienced elsewhere in other EU institutions (\"Serious cyber attack on,\" 2012).\n\nNATO first developed a cyber defence policy in the aftermath of the events in Estonia in 2007. Obviously the alliance will foremost protect and defend its own systems, but it will also provide expert assistance within the resources available to member states under a cyber attack. The original NATO cyber defence policy has already been revised, and an action plan for its implementation has been developed.\n\nStrategic cyber planning, policy implementation and cooperation with member states are the responsibility of Cyber Defence Management Board (CDMB). NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) is the foremost technical and operational tool for the protection of alliance's networks and systems. Within the NCIRC, NATO is developing rapid reaction teams (RRT), small groups of cyber experts to assist member states should there be a need for that. The RRTs are expected to reach operational capability by the end of 2012 (NATO, 2012).\n\nNATO as an alliance does not plan, prepare or conduct offensive cyber operations. The interaction and cooperation that NATO as an organisation and member states might desire, is to be clearly defined and scoped in a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CDMB and the member state. This may be significant as we have already alluded to that detailed cyber cooperation may involve exposing one's vulnerabilities and other sensitive, even classified intelligence and information. So far NATO has not concluded any MOUs in this area with non-NATO nations.\n\nThe alliance already has a well implemented lessons learned process supported by Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Capturing observations and lessons with cyber orientation is an area under development in NATO, a notable undertaking as NATO's ICT-footprint in the ISAF-operation in Afghanistan must be extensive and subject to cyber threats.\n\nAt international level, the NATO sees the European Union as an important complementary partner in combating cyber threats. NATO interaction and cooperation in cyber issues with non-NATO nations has not yet been updated to meet the cyber defence policy or the new action plan. Thus, the partner cooperation framework established in 2009 remains valid, pointing to a case-by-case approach.\n\nThe Multinational Experiment, a US led international concept development and experimentation programme, has been working on improving various fields of cyber security, inter alia: risk management, information sharing, legal frameworks, technical solutions and cyber situational awareness. The programme is expected to publish the final report and findings by the end of 2012.(ACT, 2012). Within this work, some actual and potential forms of interaction identified so far include (but are not limited to):\n\n- General information exchange (roles, tasks, organisation, observations), i.e., various forms of committees or working groups;\n- Exchange of vulnerabilities and alerts, coordination on activities to resolve these;\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

    "International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 1(4), 32-52, October-December 2011\n\n- Exchange of malware samples, forensic analysis;\n- Automated exchange of configuration data for antivirus, intrusion detection, and intrusion protection systems;\n- Automated exchange of sensor data;\n- Education, training and exercises;\n- Development, implementation and deployment of international rapid reaction teams or teams of specialists; and\n- Assignment of subject matter experts (SME) to international bodies and institutions.\n\nWithin each of these, the level of detail and depth, commitment and allocated resources depend on a case by case base as nearly no-one can afford to let loose of the few cyber SMEs they have.\n\nThe need of international cooperation has been recognised at strategic and legal levels, e.g., Russia and China are proposing for an international cyber treaty within the United Nations, whereas mostly western nations would prefer to have these nations to join Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Klimburg &amp; Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011). As cyber deterrence lacks credibility, initiatives for cyber arms control appear unlikely until a major event would provide incentive for a change (Geers, 2011). A step forward trying to avoid this quagmire would be to define and establish confidence-building measures in the cyberspace, potentially as a global cyber security treaty (Grauman, 2012).\n\n## Phasing, Readiness, and ROEs\n\nCyber crime and computer network exploitation take place every day. Computer Network Attacks can also occur in peacetime, however the legal thresholds and details of \"armed attack\" or \"act of aggression\" are beyond this paper. Considering potential phasing in cyber domain, the phases indicated in the Field Manual are quite appropriate at grand-strategy level, but the level of readiness must be higher and significantly more flexible and responsive in cyber domain. As alluded to, peace time can be, sometimes,\n\nbusiness as usual but on the other hand, even peacetime readiness would need additional levels for escalation. As an example, this could include (but not limited to):\n\n- Raised capability for system behaviour and traffic monitoring;\n- Raised capability for situational awareness and exercising command and control; and\n- Raised capability for situation analysis and reporting to higher levels.\n\nDue to the speed and short timelines when events take place in cyber domain, this peacetime phasing and flexible readiness would potentially need permanently recruited professionals: some watch officers and some personnel on call – if there were an organisation responsible for this. Flexible readiness would also need similarly flexible, but well thought of, rules of engagement; not necessarily concerning offensive actions but also covering internal defensive response options and how these are to be implemented in organisationally disjointed environment as described in the previous sections.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nWhile a solid understanding of cyber defence doctrine is still in its infancy, we shall attempt to draw some conclusions for the development of a tentative national cyber defence doctrine. In this paper, the view of Joubert (2010) has been adopted and an attempt is being made to integrate cyber into existing processes and structures although such an approach has also been criticized.\n\nCyber Defense, by definition, means organized capabilities to protect against, mitigate from, and rapidly recover from the effects of cyber attack. In the following term \"Cyber Defence\" has been adopted as an umbrella to capture protection of cyber domain at nation level encompassing all defensive measures (e.g., including CIIP) whether reactive or proactive, whereas the term \"Computer Network Defence\"\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Adopting these terms in this fashion is in no way against the strategic tasks assigned to the defence administration as expressed and agreed in the Security Strategy of the Society 2010. Therefore, at least the Cyber Defence Doctrine should adopt the broader interpretation of the term “defence” including the contribution and support by the Defence Forces to the protection of the critical information infrastructure and functions vital to the society.\n\nBecause of a multitude of reasons, a tentative Cyber Defence Doctrine should not adopt deterrence in cyber domain as one of its fundamentals, but should recognise that cyber activities guided by the doctrine may contribute and support broader strategic/political deterrence. At a more restricted level, the Defence Forces could adopt principles that, within Computer Network Defence, cyber deterrence is implemented:\n\n- To reduce the risk of cyber attacks to an acceptable level, at an acceptable cost.\n- In a fashion that focuses on integrity and availability attacks.\n- To preserve the national defence forces’ their military capabilities in the face of and during an attack.\n\nA consensus seems to be forming on the application of sovereignty and territoriality in cyber domain. Accordingly new legislation would be needed to define the scope and mandate for the cyber domain the society expects the military to defend. However, more work would be needed by the international legal community to define violations of territoriality in cyber domain.\n\nThe defence of the whole of the nation could be adopted by consistently implementing “layered defence” or layered information security practices, in defence forces, within the government and its various departments and at least within the functions vital to the society. Current division of forces into operational and regional troops can also be conceptually adopted in national planning as described earlier.\n\nCurrent doctrine describes the phases used for planning as preventing strategic strike, repelling the strategic strike and repelling an attack. Information Warfare is generally thought to take place during times of tension potentially leading into the phase of “preventing strategic strike”. Hostile information warfare is seen to focus mainly on our military targets during the strategic strike. Hostile information warfare focuses solely on our military targets while protecting the use of cyber domain for opponents own purposes during an all-out attack. This broad scheme may be sufficient for a strategy and policy, even for a national level Cyber Defence Doctrine, but practising cyber organisations may need more fine tuned granularity at least within the phase of “tension”.\n\nConscription and the use of reserves in the traditional sense do need some adaptation into the cyber domain. More studies would be needed to define issues close to the status of forces, and the use of professionals instead of raw recruits. However, using the existing structures of voluntary national defence organisations would provide national cyber defenders a network of cyber professionals useful for supporting cyber defence in peace time and in times of tension and crises.\n\nOne of the tasks of the Defence Forces is to provide support for other authorities. However, no authority in Finland has any reference to, nor authorisation for such, support in their own legislation and thus this possibility is currently useless. On the other hand, there is a precedent of an organisation quite outside the mandate of the defence, namely that of the Border Guard, to be potentially integrated to the Defence Forces in a time of crises should there be a need for it. Similar concept could also be extended to include other cyber authorities. However, to develop the political will to draft such legislation would potentially need a major cyber event to occur.\n\nIn order to facilitate real-time cross-border incident management a Cyber Defence Doctrine would need to assign appropriate points of contacts. Because of disparate, overlapping and partially inconsistent national organisation\n\nCopyright © 2011, IGI Global.

International cooperation is an essential element in the national strategy, policy and doctrine and it can be so also in cyber domain taking into consideration the mandate and competencies of each international forum. With a strong effort on the Critical Information Infrastructure the European Union seems most likely organisation to be addressed within the cyber accountability of the Ministry of Transport and Communication whereas activities of the European Union Military Staff, European Defence agency and Nato fall naturally to the sphere of the Ministry of Defence. Although collective cyber action would be beyond reasonable expectations, both ministries should strive to improve information sharing, exchange of intelligence, malware samples and vulnerability data and potentially to interconnect different automated sensor networks and systems. The question of international cyber treaty is a strategic and political one and need not be addressed in a doctrine.\n\nIn cyber world events occur in real-time with astonishing speed. The management of readiness in all cyber actors would need to be flexible and fast potentially involving new or additional levels for escalation.\n\nThe development of a national cyber defence doctrine should follow the publication of the national cyber security strategy currently being drafted as the strategy should clearly state the national political objectives for cyber security. A basis for cyber doctrine should be founded upon\n\n- Long-range national interests,\n- Perceived challenges to national security, and\n- Mission of armed forces and co-operating cyber authorities.\n\nThus, a future Cyber Defence Doctrine should address:\n\n- The concept of future cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to prevent cyber war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities to wage war,\n- The use of civilian and cyber military authorities capabilities in peacetime in support of foreign policy, and\n- The domestic role of the armed forces.\n\nThis paper has addressed these, at least partially. Issues that have not been addressed include, but are not limited to, are for example:\n\n- Use of the military capabilities to develop and maintain national defence technological industrial base by supporting, funding and directing cyber related research, development and procurement; and\n- Use of the military capabilities to support training, education and exercising cyber related skills and personnel.\n\nWould this paper be sufficient to start elaboration of the cyber defence doctrine? Probably not. Concepts and analysis presented here are derived from existing body of knowledge, policy and practice as the definition of doctrine requires but further work would be needed to ensure that potential new ideas, concepts and issues would also be addressed in a future doctrine.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nAllied Command Transformation.

As such, a cyber defence doctrine has a sound basis but should be elaborated in more detail once national cyber security strategy has been completed.
