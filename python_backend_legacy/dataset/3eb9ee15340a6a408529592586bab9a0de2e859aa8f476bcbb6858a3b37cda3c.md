Introduction\nThis article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).¹ While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers).² Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n¹ ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n² The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe.³ To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack).⁴ Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss⁵ and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.⁶\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'.⁷ Many of the\n3 This occurred with the infamous NotPetya attack. See A. Greenberg, 'The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History', Wired (22 August 2018), available online at https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ (visited 30 January 2021).

Most experts believe it to have been perpetrated by the US and Israel. E. Nakashima and J.

Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities,⁸ hospitals,⁹ power grids,¹⁰ or a dam located upstream from a major city.¹¹ One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.¹²\norganizations and companies.

Arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute, with the possible exception of those in Ukraine. See infra notes 116–121 and accompanying text (discussing cyber-attacks in Ukraine). Potentially, the genocide in Myanmar was cyber-enabled: see infra note 150. However, the ICC lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed solely within Myanmar. See infra note 75 and accompanying text. The genocide against the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted¹³ — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.¹⁴) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target¹⁵ and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others.¹⁶ Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state.¹⁷ Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.¹⁸\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n¹³ See e.g. S.M.

While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.¹⁹\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'.²⁰ Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.²¹\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n¹⁹ This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n²⁰ Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n²¹ Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.²²\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare.²³ The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0',²⁴ addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict.²⁵ The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states,²⁶ the author will proceed\n²² Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, finds that it is not the role of the pre-trial chamber to direct the Prosecutor as to what result she should reach in the gravity assessment or what weight she should assign to the individual factors').

Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them,²⁷ at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.²⁸\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.²⁹) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack.³⁰ Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’.³¹ The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects.³² While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.³³\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n²⁷ Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n²⁸ Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n²⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’).

For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold.³⁴ On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'.³⁵ Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations.³⁶ Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted.³⁷ Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n³⁴ The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

(That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter³⁸ — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’.³⁹ They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁰ This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.⁴¹\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold.⁴² For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’.⁴³ While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n³⁸ Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n³⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’). The United States maintains that there is no difference between a ‘use of force’ and an ‘armed attack’. Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 7.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 341, § 8 (emphasis added).\n⁴¹ See ICC Forum, supra note 7 (‘[i]f the [P]rosecutor chooses a case where the effects are not easily shown to be analogous to previous kinetic attacks, then she risks invalidating the court and the crime’s serious nature’).\n⁴² The Tallinn experts similarly left a door open when they suggested that in other situations (other than where there is injury or killing of persons or physical damage or destruction of objects) what constitutes ‘use of force’ is ‘less clear’: Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 8. See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n⁴³ Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N.

Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.⁴⁶\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n⁴⁴ Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n⁴⁵ The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

It is beyond the scope of the present article to address all variations in approach.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nfinancial hardship dramatically reducing their quality of life, and potentially, ability to receive medical care) necessarily less grave? The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49]\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n47 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n48 The author refers to the NotPetya attack that spread to Maersk and other companies around the world. See Greenberg, supra note 3. But see Section 3.D infra (the ICC's intent requirement likely excludes responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limits responsibility even for foreseen consequences).\n49 This also occurred during the NotPetya attack which took place in conjunction with offensive military operations by Russian forces into Ukraine. Greenberg, supra note 3.\n50 For example, Bemba focused on command responsibility for mass rape, murder, and pillage, charged as crimes against humanity and war crimes; Lubanga focused on the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate in hostilities; and al Mahdi resulted in a guilty plea to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion. Although the charges in the last two cases were seen as somewhat ground-breaking when brought, admittedly, the cyber-domain would represent even more novel territory.\n51 Another reason to read ICC 'gravity' as requiring a fairly high threshold is that one would not want any confusion that it lowers the threshold for what constitutes an 'armed attack' in the cyber-realm, which could carry significant consequences as an 'armed attack' permits the exercise of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71).\n52 There is controversy whether data should be considered an 'object' under IHL. See J.T. Biller and M.N. Schmitt, 'Classification of Cyber Capabilities and Operations as Weapons, Means, or Methods of Warfare', 95 International Law Studies (2019) 179, at 181.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.⁵³\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result⁵⁴ — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.⁵⁵\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes,⁵⁶ so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n⁵³ See e.g. K. Mačák, ‘Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer Data as Objects under International Humanitarian Law’, 48 Israel Law Review (2015) 55; J. Horowitz, ‘Cyber Operations under International Humanitarian Law: Perspectives from the ICRC’, 24 ASIL Insights (19 May 2020) (data includes ‘[m]edical data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client files, or electronic lists and records’). Horowitz notes that ‘[d]eleting, restricting, or tampering with essential civilian data can quickly bring government services and private businesses to a complete standstill’, and that the ICRC views ‘civilian data’ as ‘civilian objects’ for IHL purposes. Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n⁵⁴ See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n⁵⁵ M.E.

See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established,⁵⁷ in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable;⁵⁸ thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive⁵⁹ that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral)⁶⁰ even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.⁶¹ Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation,⁶² issuing a warrant,⁶³ and for confirmation of charges⁶⁴ — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n⁵⁷ See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n⁵⁸ The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n⁵⁹ See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n⁶⁰ Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n⁶¹ Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65]\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n65 N.

The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n72 See A. Lubin, 'Politics, Power Dynamics, and the Limits of Existing Self-Regulation and Oversight in ICC Preliminary Examinations' (making this suggestion), in M. Bergsmo and C. Stahn (eds), Quality Control in Preliminary Examination: Vol. 2 (Torkel Opsahl Academic EPublisher, 2018) 78, 141–143.\n73 There is an entire body of jurisdiction based on the 'effects' test. See e.g. The S.S. 'Lotus' (France v. Turkey), P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 10, p. 4 (1927). However, for the ICC's purposes, the more salient inquiry appears to be whether one element of the crime occurred on the territory of a state party (objective territoriality). See infra note 75.\n74 See Art. 12(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt. See also Art. 12(3) ICCSt.\n75 Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the People's Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Situation in Bangladesh/Myanmar (ICC-01/19-27), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 1 November 2019 ('Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision'), § 61.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis.⁷⁶ The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.⁷⁷\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’.⁷⁸ The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’.⁷⁹ If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction.⁸⁰ As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment⁸¹ and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction.⁸² The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment⁸³ — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n⁷⁶ Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment.⁸⁴ The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.⁸⁵\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets,⁸⁶ another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context).⁸⁷ The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁸ ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁹ While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’.⁹⁰ Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.⁹¹\n⁸⁴ United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch.

(citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).⁹²) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach),⁹³ it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’.⁹⁴ ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.⁹⁵\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n⁹² J. Trahan, *Genocide, War Crimes, and Crime Against Humanity: A Topical Digest of the Case Law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia* (Human Rights Watch, 2006), ch.

Compare Public Redacted Version of ‘Prosecution’s Response to the Defence Closing Brief’, 17 July 2018, ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Conf, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Red), Trial Chamber VI, 7 November 2018, § 247; and Closing Arguments, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-T-264-Red2-ENG), Trial Chamber VI, 30 August 2018, at 49–51 (arguing that foresight of a criminal consequence ‘even if [its] commission is not certain’ may suffice); with Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 774, note 2348 (rejecting the Prosecutor’s argument and requiring ‘virtual certainty’).\n⁹⁵ An exception might be if a particular war crime on its face encompassed anticipated or foreseeable consequences — for example, if the principles of distinction or proportionality were violated.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nextended by analogy. In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'.⁹⁶ Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges.⁹⁷ Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute\nAs mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force.⁹⁸ '[C]yber operations are properly\n⁹⁶ Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n⁹⁷ UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C.

Van Schaack, Essentials: International Criminal Law (Aspen Publishers, 2009), at 92 ('It is generally accepted at the international level that treaties are to be treated as living documents. In other words, they are to be interpreted in the context of the time in which they are being applied, and not as they would have been interpreted at the time of their drafting').\n⁹⁸ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 329 (Rule 68).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1153\ncharacterized as a method of warfare when employed to harm or interfere with enemy forces, military objectives, the civilian population, or civilian objects.⁹⁹ The Tallinn Manuals further take the view that, in a state of armed conflict (whether international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict), all the rules of international humanitarian law apply in the cyber-domain.¹⁰⁰ The ICJ’s holding in the Nuclear Weapons case reinforces this as the court maintained that IHL applies to ‘all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons’.¹⁰¹ Cyber-operations may be employed during and in the context of an already existing armed conflict or they (either alone or in conjunction with conventional weapons) might, in theory, create the state of armed conflict.¹⁰² If cyber-operations are subject to IHL, then, for example, they may not target civilians¹⁰³ or be targeted indiscriminately¹⁰⁴ (both of which would violate the principle of distinction), and may not cause excessive ‘collateral damage’ (which would violate the principle of proportionality).¹⁰⁵ Tallinn 2.0 expressly acknowledges that, when such IHL rules are violated, ‘[c]yber operations may\n⁹⁹ Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 218.\n¹⁰⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 375 (Rule 80). But see supra note 26 (Tallinn not universally accepted).\n¹⁰¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports (1996) 226, § 86 (the law of armed conflict ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’).\n¹⁰² It is more difficult to image cyber-operations creating the armed conflict but if the attacks cause deaths and/or destruction similar to a physical/kinetic attack, one can more readily envision this.\n¹⁰³ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 422 (Rule 94: ‘The civilian population … shall not be the object of cyber attack’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(i) ICCSt. (war crime of directing attacks against the civilian population in international armed conflict); Art. 8(2)(e)(i) ICCSt. (same in non-international armed conflict). But see Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 852 (applying the principle of distinction becomes complex because ‘much of cyberspace is dual use’, with ‘[n]inety-five percent of military communications us[ing] civilian networks at some stage’).\n¹⁰⁴ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 455 (Rule 105: ‘It is prohibited to employ means or methods of cyber warfare that are indiscriminate by nature. [This occurs] when they cannot be: (a) directed at a specific military objective, or (b) limited in their effects as required by the laws of armed conflict, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction’). But see infra note 122 and accompanying text (annex missing for Rome Statute crime prohibiting ‘inherently indiscriminate’ weapons).\n¹⁰⁵ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 470 (Rule 113: ‘A cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) ICCSt. (in international armed conflict, war crime of ‘intentionally launching at attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’). See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.¹⁰⁶\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’¹⁰⁷ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict,¹⁰⁸ and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime,¹¹⁰ as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.¹¹¹\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’.¹¹² The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’.¹¹³ For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization.¹¹⁴ It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n¹⁰⁶ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n¹⁰⁷ Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n¹⁰⁸ The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

(To meet the ‘intensity’ requirement the armed conflict must be ‘protracted’). See Art. 8(2)(f) ICCSt. (referencing ‘protracted armed conflict between ... [organized armed groups]’). As to the ‘organization’ requirement, there must be an ability to plan and carry out sustained military operations. Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.¹¹⁵\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities.¹¹⁶ Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU.¹¹⁷ Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population,¹¹⁸ or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’.¹¹⁹ The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii).¹²⁰ Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.¹²¹\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n¹¹⁵ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n¹¹⁶ Greenberg, supra note 3; F.

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex.¹²² A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted.¹²³ States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’.¹²⁴ Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’.¹²⁵ The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict.¹²⁶ There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n¹²² For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S.

See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n¹²⁴ Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n¹²⁵ Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n¹²⁶ See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'.[127] The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.[128]\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack[129] was 'widespread' or 'systematic';[130] and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy';[131] so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction.[132] The same cyber-operation, if it could\n127 See e.g. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 7(1) (a) Crime against humanity of murder, Elements 1-2. The contextual elements have been enumerated as requiring 'i) an attack directed against any civilian population; (ii) a State or organizational policy; (iii) an attack of a widespread or systematic nature; (iv) a nexus ... between the individual act and the attack; and (v) knowledge of the attack'. See Corrigendum to 'Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of the Côte d'Ivoire', Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (ICC-02/11-14-Corr), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 5 November 2011, § 29.\n128 For the precise terminology, see Art. 7(1)(a)-(k) ICCSt.\n129 There is also the requirement of proof of a nexus between the underlying crime(s) and the attack, but in this scenario the murders result directly from the cyber-operation opening the dams; thus, the nexus appears met.\n130 In the facts suggested, the ramifications could be considered 'widespread' if there are a large number of victims; that there were several attacks on the dams could alternatively be considered 'systematic'. One would only require proof of one. See Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Bosco Ntaganda, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-309), Pre-Trial Chamber II, 9 June 2014, § 24 (finding an attack 'widespread' considering the 'large number of civilian victims', the 'broad geographical area' involved, and the duration of the attack); Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, Al Bashir (ICC-02/05-01/09-3), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 4 March 2009, § 81 ('[t]he term, \"systematic\" pertains to the organized nature of the acts of violence and to the improbability of their random occurrence').\n131 As to the 'policy', proof may be inferred from a variety of factors, such as whether (i) the attack was planned, directed or organized; (ii) a recurring pattern of violence; (iii) the use of public or private resources to further the policy; (iv) involvement of the State or organizational forces in the commission of crimes; (v) statements, instructions or documentation attributable to the State or the organization condoning or encouraging the commission of crimes; and/or (vi) an underlying motivation'. See Judgment, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343), Trial Chamber III, 21 March 2016, § 160.\n132 The crime could additionally constitute 'extermination', which is large-scale killing. Because the 'attack' could also constitute an 'armed attack', it is possible these facts could alternatively be analyzed as a war crime, particularly if the penetration of the dams trigger 'armed conflict' and there are different states involved. The same facts also could constitute the 'crime of aggression' if a number of additional elements are met. See infra Section 4.D.\n1158\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution.¹³³ Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’.¹³⁴ Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.¹³⁵\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met.¹³⁶ Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).¹³⁷\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’.¹³⁸ As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group).¹³⁹ This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n¹³³ Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n¹³⁴ Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n¹³⁵ It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n¹³⁶ See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n¹³⁷ See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n¹³⁸ Genocide Convention, Art.

Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances.¹⁴⁰ As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group.¹⁴¹ While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime¹⁴² — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.¹⁴³\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group.¹⁴⁴ The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’¹⁴⁵ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes.¹⁴⁷ Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda,¹⁴⁸ the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n¹⁴⁰ Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases).

The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁷ An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’.

For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology,¹⁴⁹ or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means.¹⁵⁰ (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.¹⁵¹) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).¹⁵²\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression'¹⁵³ constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'.¹⁵⁴ The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n¹⁴⁹ One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Mozur writes: They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n¹⁵¹ Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n¹⁵² See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n¹⁵³ Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n¹⁵⁴ Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n155 Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt. Thus, individual and collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and operations authorized under Chapter VII are both excluded.\n156 Ibid. The list additionally is not exhaustive because Article 8bis(2), second sentence, states that the following acts 'shall' qualify, suggesting the list is open-ended, subject to the requirements in Article 8bis(1).\n157 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt. Additionally, the perpetrator must have been 'aware of the factual circumstances that established that such a use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', and 'aware of the factual circumstances that established such a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Article 8bis Crime of aggression, Element 6. But '[t]here is no requirement to prove that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to whether the use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', nor 'that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to the manifest' nature of the violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. Ibid., Introduction to Article 8bis, §§ 2, 4.\n158 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\n159 Ibid.\n160 See also Resolution RC/Res.6*, supra note 81, Understandings 6-7.\n161 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 584 ('international law of state responsibility can and should govern the attribution of responsibility to states over cyberoperations'); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 84 (Rule 14: 'A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation'). In determining attribution for the purpose of state responsibility, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case looked to whether 'effective control' existed. Nicaragua case, supra note 39, § 115. See also International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries (adopted), UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), Arts 5, 8, 9, 11. By contrast, for the purpose of attributing the actions of a non-state armed group to a state in order to determine that an armed conflict is international, the test ultimately endorsed in the ICTY's Tadic case was whether the state exercised 'overall control' over the non-state actor(s). Judgment, Tadic (IT-94-1-A), Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, § 145. If the state incorporates non-state actors into its armed forces or attribution is otherwise satisfied, a number of listed acts of aggression could potentially apply.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.¹⁶²\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’,¹⁶³ and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’.¹⁶⁴ The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state.¹⁶⁵ One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state.¹⁶⁶ The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality.¹⁶⁷ Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations¹⁶⁸ — if they are valid¹⁶⁹ — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).¹⁷⁰\n¹⁶² See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n¹⁶³ Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n¹⁶⁴ Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n¹⁶⁵ See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n¹⁶⁶ See supra note 161 (attribution).\n¹⁶⁷ The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n¹⁶⁸ See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶⁹ See Trahan, supra note 44.\n¹⁷⁰ See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2).¹⁷¹ Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation,¹⁷² is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties.¹⁷³ Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare¹⁷⁴ will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n¹⁷¹ See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n¹⁷² See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n¹⁷³ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n¹⁷⁴ See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies¹⁷⁵ — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks.¹⁷⁶ Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset,¹⁷⁷ could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n¹⁷⁵ While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n¹⁷⁶ As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n¹⁷⁷ Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted.",

Introduction\nThis article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers). Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe. To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack). Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'. Many of the\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nwar crimes that could be committed during a conventional armed conflict could potentially also be committed through cyber means, or by employing both cyber and conventional weapons. Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities, hospitals, power grids, or a dam located upstream from a major city. One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.\norganizations and companies. See Greenberg, supra note 3. The 2008 attack on Georgia was also ‘blended’. See ICC Forum, ‘New Frontiers for the ICC (International Criminal Court): Tackling Cyber Attacks through the Crime of Aggression’ (22 February 2018), available online at https://iccforum.com/forum/permalink/110/13832 (visited 30 January 2021).\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others. Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state. Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n See e.g. S.M. Bellovin, S. Landau, and H.S. Lin, ‘Limiting the Undesired Impact of Cyber Weapons: Technical Requirements and Policy Implications’, 3 Journal of Cybersecurity (2017) 59; N.C. Rowe, ‘War Crimes from Cyberweapons’, 6 Journal of Information Warfare (2007) 15, available online at https://faculty.nps.edu/ncrowe/iwcrimes.htm (visited 30 January 2021) (‘Cyber-attacks can and should be designed to be selective in what systems they attack and what they attack in those systems’).\n See infra Section 3.B. (difficulties of attribution).\n This occurred with the NotPetya attack.\n States can design cyber-weapons to reduce proliferation risks and to reduce the ability of others to ‘repurpose’ cyber-weapons: Bellovin et al., supra note 13, at 60.\n See e.g. J. Taylor, ‘Chinese Cyberhackers “Blurring Line Between State Power and Crime”’, The Guardian (7 August 2019), available online at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/chinese-cyberhackers-blurring-line-between-state-power-and (visited 30 January 2021) (discussing a group of state-sponsored hackers in China).\n See K. Mačák, ‘On the Shelf, But Close At Hand: The Contribution of Non-State Initiatives to International Cyber Law’, AJIL Unbound (2019) 81, at 82 (‘Asymmetries of cyberspace mean that the most powerful nations are, in a peculiar way, also the most vulnerable ones’); Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 842 (‘Because it is much less costly to mount cyber-attacks than to launch conventional attacks, and because highly industrialized states are generally more dependent upon computer networks and are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks may prove to be a powerful weapon of the weak’).\n\nThis article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC's Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations. While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'. Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare. The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0', addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict. The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states, the author will proceed\n Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, finds that it is not the role of the pre-trial chamber to direct the Prosecutor as to what result she should reach in the gravity assessment or what weight she should assign to the individual factors').

Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them, at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack. Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’. The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects. While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’).

For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold. On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'. Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations. Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted. Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

Part of the OTP’s analysis also rested on the conclusion that there was not ‘a reasonable basis to believe that senior [Israeli Defense Forces] commanders and Israeli leaders were responsible as perpetrators or planners’.

Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’, 67 UCLA Law Review (2020) 520.\n See Judgment and Sentence, Al Mahdi (ICC-01/12-01/15-171), Trial Chamber VIII, 27 September 2016, §§ 77, 79–82 (recalling that crimes against property may be of lesser gravity compared to crimes against the person, but taking into account the character of the objects and their legal status). For discussion of a cyber-operation targeting hospitals in Ukraine, see text accompanying note 116 infra.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nthe gravity threshold for cyber-operations that satisfy the Rome Statute’s gravity requirement.\nThe Tallinn experts additionally considered what would constitute an ‘armed attack’ in the cyber-domain. (That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’. They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’. This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold. For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’. While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’). The United States maintains that there is no difference between a ‘use of force’ and an ‘armed attack’.

See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N.

Similarly, the Netherlands has taken the view that a catastrophic systems attack that causes very serious economic impact could constitute an ‘armed attack’, and this also raises the question whether very serious economic impact would reach the threshold of Rome Statute gravity (again, assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49]\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes, so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n See e.g. K.

Horowitz, ‘Cyber Operations under International Humanitarian Law: Perspectives from the ICRC’, 24 ASIL Insights (19 May 2020) (data includes ‘[m]edical data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client files, or electronic lists and records’). Horowitz notes that ‘[d]eleting, restricting, or tampering with essential civilian data can quickly bring government services and private businesses to a complete standstill’, and that the ICRC views ‘civilian data’ as ‘civilian objects’ for IHL purposes. Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n M.E.

See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established, in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable; thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral) even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation, issuing a warrant, and for confirmation of charges — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65]\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nrather than immediately recognize they have been subjected to an 'attack'. The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis. The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’. The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’. If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction. As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction. The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment. The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets, another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context). The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’. ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’. While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’. Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.\n United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch. XVIII, Penal Matters, ‘Amendments on the Crime of Aggression to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court’, as of 18 January 2021, available online at https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&amp;chapter=18⟨=en (visited 30 January 2021).\n See Arts 13(b), 15ter ICCSt. For background on Security Council referrals and the crime of aggression, see J.

(citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach), it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’. ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n J. Trahan, *Genocide, War Crimes, and Crime Against Humanity: A Topical Digest of the Case Law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia* (Human Rights Watch, 2006), ch.

Compare Public Redacted Version of ‘Prosecution’s Response to the Defence Closing Brief’, 17 July 2018, ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Conf, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Red), Trial Chamber VI, 7 November 2018, § 247; and Closing Arguments, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-T-264-Red2-ENG), Trial Chamber VI, 30 August 2018, at 49–51 (arguing that foresight of a criminal consequence ‘even if [its] commission is not certain’ may suffice); with Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 774, note 2348 (rejecting the Prosecutor’s argument and requiring ‘virtual certainty’).\n An exception might be if a particular war crime on its face encompassed anticipated or foreseeable consequences — for example, if the principles of distinction or proportionality were violated.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nextended by analogy. In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'. Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges. Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute\nAs mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force. '[C]yber operations are properly\n Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C. Slye and B. Van Schaack, Essentials: International Criminal Law (Aspen Publishers, 2009), at 92 ('It is generally accepted at the international level that treaties are to be treated as living documents. In other words, they are to be interpreted in the context of the time in which they are being applied, and not as they would have been interpreted at the time of their drafting').\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 329 (Rule 68).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1153\ncharacterized as a method of warfare when employed to harm or interfere with enemy forces, military objectives, the civilian population, or civilian objects. The Tallinn Manuals further take the view that, in a state of armed conflict (whether international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict), all the rules of international humanitarian law apply in the cyber-domain. The ICJ’s holding in the Nuclear Weapons case reinforces this as the court maintained that IHL applies to ‘all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons’. Cyber-operations may be employed during and in the context of an already existing armed conflict or they (either alone or in conjunction with conventional weapons) might, in theory, create the state of armed conflict. If cyber-operations are subject to IHL, then, for example, they may not target civilians or be targeted indiscriminately (both of which would violate the principle of distinction), and may not cause excessive ‘collateral damage’ (which would violate the principle of proportionality). Tallinn 2.0 expressly acknowledges that, when such IHL rules are violated, ‘[c]yber operations may\n Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 218.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 375 (Rule 80). But see supra note 26 (Tallinn not universally accepted).\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports (1996) 226, § 86 (the law of armed conflict ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’).\n It is more difficult to image cyber-operations creating the armed conflict but if the attacks cause deaths and/or destruction similar to a physical/kinetic attack, one can more readily envision this.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 422 (Rule 94: ‘The civilian population … shall not be the object of cyber attack’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(i) ICCSt. (war crime of directing attacks against the civilian population in international armed conflict); Art. 8(2)(e)(i) ICCSt. (same in non-international armed conflict). But see Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 852 (applying the principle of distinction becomes complex because ‘much of cyberspace is dual use’, with ‘[n]inety-five percent of military communications us[ing] civilian networks at some stage’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 455 (Rule 105: ‘It is prohibited to employ means or methods of cyber warfare that are indiscriminate by nature. [This occurs] when they cannot be: (a) directed at a specific military objective, or (b) limited in their effects as required by the laws of armed conflict, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction’). But see infra note 122 and accompanying text (annex missing for Rome Statute crime prohibiting ‘inherently indiscriminate’ weapons).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 470 (Rule 113: ‘A cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) ICCSt. (in international armed conflict, war crime of ‘intentionally launching at attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’). See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict, and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict. There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime, as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’. The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’. For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization. It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities. Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU. Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’. The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii). Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’).

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex. A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted. States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’. Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’. The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict. There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S.

See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'.[127] The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.[128]\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack[129] was 'widespread' or 'systematic';[130] and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy';[131] so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction.[132] The same cyber-operation, if it could\n\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution. Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met. Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’. As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group). This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances. As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group. While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group. The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’. Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes. Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda, the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n See supra note 57.\n See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\ncyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology, or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means. (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression' constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'. The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y. Times (22 May 2019), available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html (visited 30 January 2021). See also 'China Forces Birth Control on Uighurs to Suppress Population', Associated Press (29 June 2020), available online at https://apnews.com/article/e2674c069d46f6d5c9a3d3be40d612d4 (visited 30 January 2021).\n See e.g. P. Mozur, 'A Genocide Incited on Facebook, With Posts from Myanmar's Military', N.Y. Times (15 October 2018), available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html (visited 30 January 2021). Mozur writes: They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’, and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’. The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state. One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state. The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality. Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations — if they are valid — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).\n See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n See supra note 161 (attribution).\n The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n See Trahan, supra note 44.\n See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2). Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation, is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties. Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks. Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset, could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted.",

    "# 1. Introduction": "This article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).¹ While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers).² Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n¹ ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n² The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.",
    "## 2. Background": "The past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe.³ To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack).⁴ Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss⁵ and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.⁶\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'.⁷ Many of the\n3 This occurred with the infamous NotPetya attack. See A. Greenberg, 'The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History', Wired (22 August 2018), available online at https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ (visited 30 January 2021).

Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities,⁸ hospitals,⁹ power grids,¹⁰ or a dam located upstream from a major city.¹¹ One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction.

Arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute, with the possible exception of those in Ukraine. See infra notes 116–121 and accompanying text (discussing cyber-attacks in Ukraine). Potentially, the genocide in Myanmar was cyber-enabled: see infra note 150. However, the ICC lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed solely within Myanmar. See infra note 75 and accompanying text. The genocide against the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted¹³ — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.¹⁴) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target¹⁵ and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others.¹⁶ Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state.¹⁷ Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.¹⁸\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n¹³ See e.g. S.M.

While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.¹⁹",
    "## 3. Overarching Considerations": "### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'.²⁰ Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.²¹\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n¹⁹ This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n²⁰ Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n²¹ Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.²²\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare.²³ The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0',²⁴ addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict.²⁵ The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states,²⁶ the author will proceed\n²² Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them,²⁷ at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.²⁸\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.²⁹) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack.³⁰ Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’.³¹ The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects.³² While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.³³\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n²⁷ Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n²⁸ Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n²⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’). Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ (emphasis added).\n³⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 330 (Rule 69 states: ‘A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when it has scale and effects … comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’).\n³¹ Ibid., at 332, § 8.\n³² Ibid., at 333–336, § 9(a)–(e). They also suggest as criteria: military character, state involvement and ‘presumptive legality’ (that is, if the act is not forbidden by international law there is a presumption it is permitted). See 336, § 9(f)–(h).\n³³ See Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, § 62, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/otp-policy_paper_preliminary_examinations_2013-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); see also §§ 64–65 (additional criteria); M. Roscini, ‘Gravity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and Cyber Conduct that Constitutes, Instigates or\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1141\nIt is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC's gravity threshold. For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold.³⁴ On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'.³⁵ Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations.³⁶ Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted.³⁷ Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n³⁴ The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

For discussion of a cyber-operation targeting hospitals in Ukraine, see text accompanying note 116 infra.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nthe gravity threshold for cyber-operations that satisfy the Rome Statute’s gravity requirement.\nThe Tallinn experts additionally considered what would constitute an ‘armed attack’ in the cyber-domain. (That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter³⁸ — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’.³⁹ They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁰ This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.⁴¹\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold.⁴² For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’.⁴³ While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n³⁸ Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n³⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’). The United States maintains that there is no difference between a ‘use of force’ and an ‘armed attack’. Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 7.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 341, § 8 (emphasis added).\n⁴¹ See ICC Forum, supra note 7 (‘[i]f the [P]rosecutor chooses a case where the effects are not easily shown to be analogous to previous kinetic attacks, then she risks invalidating the court and the crime’s serious nature’).\n⁴² The Tallinn experts similarly left a door open when they suggested that in other situations (other than where there is injury or killing of persons or physical damage or destruction of objects) what constitutes ‘use of force’ is ‘less clear’: Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 8. See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n⁴³ Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N.

Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.⁴⁶\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n⁴⁴ Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n⁴⁵ The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

It is beyond the scope of the present article to address all variations in approach.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nfinancial hardship dramatically reducing their quality of life, and potentially, ability to receive medical care) necessarily less grave? The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force'; yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss? What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas. Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included. This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n47 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n48 The author refers to the NotPetya attack that spread to Maersk and other companies around the world. See Greenberg, supra note 3. But see Section 3.D infra (the ICC's intent requirement likely excludes responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limits responsibility even for foreseen consequences).\n49 This also occurred during the NotPetya attack which took place in conjunction with offensive military operations by Russian forces into Ukraine. Greenberg, supra note 3.\n50 For example, Bemba focused on command responsibility for mass rape, murder, and pillage, charged as crimes against humanity and war crimes; Lubanga focused on the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate in hostilities; and al Mahdi resulted in a guilty plea to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion. Although the charges in the last two cases were seen as somewhat ground-breaking when brought, admittedly, the cyber-domain would represent even more novel territory.\n51 Another reason to read ICC 'gravity' as requiring a fairly high threshold is that one would not want any confusion that it lowers the threshold for what constitutes an 'armed attack' in the cyber-realm, which could carry significant consequences as an 'armed attack' permits the exercise of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71).\n52 There is controversy whether data should be considered an 'object' under IHL. See J.T. Biller and M.N. Schmitt, 'Classification of Cyber Capabilities and Operations as Weapons, Means, or Methods of Warfare', 95 International Law Studies (2019) 179, at 181.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.⁵³\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result⁵⁴ — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.⁵⁵\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes,⁵⁶ so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n⁵³ See e.g. K.

Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n⁵⁴ See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n⁵⁵ M.E.

See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established,⁵⁷ in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable;⁵⁸ thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive⁵⁹ that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral)⁶⁰ even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.⁶¹ Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation,⁶² issuing a warrant,⁶³ and for confirmation of charges⁶⁴ — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n⁵⁷ See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n⁵⁸ The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n⁵⁹ See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n⁶⁰ Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n⁶¹ Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations, states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran]. Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations. Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally. Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n65 N. Tsagourias, 'Cyber Attacks, Self-Defense and the Problem of Attribution', 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (2012) 229, 233. See Dederer and Singer, supra note 61, at 438 ('it is still nearly impossible to trace a cyber-operation with absolute certainty to a particular computer system and, more importantly, to its author') (citing sources).\n66 Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 843.\n67 J. Stubbs and C.

The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n72 See A. Lubin, 'Politics, Power Dynamics, and the Limits of Existing Self-Regulation and Oversight in ICC Preliminary Examinations' (making this suggestion), in M. Bergsmo and C. Stahn (eds), Quality Control in Preliminary Examination: Vol. 2 (Torkel Opsahl Academic EPublisher, 2018) 78, 141–143.\n73 There is an entire body of jurisdiction based on the 'effects' test. See e.g. The S.S. 'Lotus' (France v. Turkey), P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 10, p. 4 (1927). However, for the ICC's purposes, the more salient inquiry appears to be whether one element of the crime occurred on the territory of a state party (objective territoriality). See infra note 75.\n74 See Art. 12(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt. See also Art. 12(3) ICCSt.\n75 Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the People's Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Situation in Bangladesh/Myanmar (ICC-01/19-27), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 1 November 2019 ('Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision'), § 61.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis.⁷⁶ The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.⁷⁷\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’.⁷⁸ The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’.⁷⁹ If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction.⁸⁰ As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment⁸¹ and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction.⁸² The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment⁸³ — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n⁷⁶ Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 55-56, §§ 3-4 (Rule 9).\n⁷⁹ Ibid., § 2.\n⁸⁰ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n⁸¹ The Crime of Aggression, RC/Res.6*, Review Conference of the Rome Statute, adopted 11 June 2010, by consensus, available online at https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/docs/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸² Activation of the Jurisdiction of the Court Over the Crime of Aggression, ICC-ASP/16/Res.5, 14 December 2017 (‘Activating Resolution’), available online at https://asp.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/ASP16/ICC-ASP-16-Res5-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸³ There is an argument that the jurisdictional limitations, which arguably came about only in the Activating Resolution, were ineffective to modify the original jurisdictional agreement in the Kampala amendment. See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment.⁸⁴ The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.⁸⁵\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets,⁸⁶ another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context).⁸⁷ The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁸ ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁹ While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’.⁹⁰ Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.⁹¹\n⁸⁴ United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch.

(citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).⁹²) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach),⁹³ it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’.⁹⁴ ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.⁹⁵\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n⁹² J.

In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'.⁹⁶ Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges.⁹⁷ Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.",

See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.¹⁰⁶\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’¹⁰⁷ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict,¹⁰⁸ and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime,¹¹⁰ as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.¹¹¹\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’.¹¹² The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’.¹¹³ For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization.¹¹⁴ It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n¹⁰⁶ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n¹⁰⁷ Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n¹⁰⁸ The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

(To meet the ‘intensity’ requirement the armed conflict must be ‘protracted’). See Art. 8(2)(f) ICCSt. (referencing ‘protracted armed conflict between ... [organized armed groups]’). As to the ‘organization’ requirement, there must be an ability to plan and carry out sustained military operations. Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.¹¹⁵\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities.¹¹⁶ Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU.¹¹⁷ Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population,¹¹⁸ or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’.¹¹⁹ The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii).¹²⁰ Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.¹²¹\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n¹¹⁵ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n¹¹⁶ Greenberg, supra note 3; F.

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex.¹²² A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted.¹²³ States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’.¹²⁴ Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’.¹²⁵ The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict.¹²⁶ There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n¹²² For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S. Clark, ‘Building on Article 8(2)(b)(xx) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: Weapons and Methods of Warfare’, 12 New Criminal Law Review (2009) 366.\n¹²³ See Protocol I, Art. 51(4)(a)–(c) (prohibition of indiscriminate attacks); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 467, § 1 (the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks is customary international law). See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n¹²⁴ Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n¹²⁵ Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n¹²⁶ See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'. The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack was 'widespread' or 'systematic'; and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy'; so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction. The same cyber-operation, if it could\n127 See e.g. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 7(1) (a) Crime against humanity of murder, Elements 1-2. The contextual elements have been enumerated as requiring 'i) an attack directed against any civilian population; (ii) a State or organizational policy; (iii) an attack of a widespread or systematic nature; (iv) a nexus ... between the individual act and the attack; and (v) knowledge of the attack'. See Corrigendum to 'Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of the Côte d'Ivoire', Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (ICC-02/11-14-Corr), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 5 November 2011, § 29.\n128 For the precise terminology, see Art. 7(1)(a)-(k) ICCSt.\n129 There is also the requirement of proof of a nexus between the underlying crime(s) and the attack, but in this scenario the murders result directly from the cyber-operation opening the dams; thus, the nexus appears met.\n130 In the facts suggested, the ramifications could be considered 'widespread' if there are a large number of victims; that there were several attacks on the dams could alternatively be considered 'systematic'. One would only require proof of one. See Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Bosco Ntaganda, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-309), Pre-Trial Chamber II, 9 June 2014, § 24 (finding an attack 'widespread' considering the 'large number of civilian victims', the 'broad geographical area' involved, and the duration of the attack); Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, Al Bashir (ICC-02/05-01/09-3), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 4 March 2009, § 81 ('[t]he term, \"systematic\" pertains to the organized nature of the acts of violence and to the improbability of their random occurrence').\n131 As to the 'policy', proof may be inferred from a variety of factors, such as whether (i) the attack was planned, directed or organized; (ii) a recurring pattern of violence; (iii) the use of public or private resources to further the policy; (iv) involvement of the State or organizational forces in the commission of crimes; (v) statements, instructions or documentation attributable to the State or the organization condoning or encouraging the commission of crimes; and/or (vi) an underlying motivation'. See Judgment, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343), Trial Chamber III, 21 March 2016, § 160.\n132 The crime could additionally constitute 'extermination', which is large-scale killing. Because the 'attack' could also constitute an 'armed attack', it is possible these facts could alternatively be analyzed as a war crime, particularly if the penetration of the dams trigger 'armed conflict' and there are different states involved. The same facts also could constitute the 'crime of aggression' if a number of additional elements are met. See infra Section 4.D.\n1158\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution.¹³³ Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’.¹³⁴ Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.¹³⁵\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met.¹³⁶ Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).¹³⁷\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’.¹³⁸ As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group).¹³⁹ This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n¹³³ Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n¹³⁴ Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n¹³⁵ It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n¹³⁶ See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n¹³⁷ See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n¹³⁸ Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n¹³⁹ Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances.¹⁴⁰ As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group.¹⁴¹ While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime¹⁴² — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.¹⁴³\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group.¹⁴⁴ The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’¹⁴⁵ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes.¹⁴⁷ Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda,¹⁴⁸ the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n¹⁴⁰ Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n¹⁴¹ Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n¹⁴² See supra note 57.\n¹⁴³ See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴⁴ Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁵ Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n¹⁴⁶ Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁷ An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n¹⁴⁸ For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\ncyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology,¹⁴⁹ or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means.¹⁵⁰ (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.¹⁵¹) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).¹⁵²\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression'¹⁵³ constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'.¹⁵⁴ The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n¹⁴⁹ One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Mozur writes: They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n¹⁵¹ Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n¹⁵² See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n¹⁵³ Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n¹⁵⁴ Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n155 Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt. Thus, individual and collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and operations authorized under Chapter VII are both excluded.\n156 Ibid. The list additionally is not exhaustive because Article 8bis(2), second sentence, states that the following acts 'shall' qualify, suggesting the list is open-ended, subject to the requirements in Article 8bis(1).\n157 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt. Additionally, the perpetrator must have been 'aware of the factual circumstances that established that such a use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', and 'aware of the factual circumstances that established such a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Article 8bis Crime of aggression, Element 6. But '[t]here is no requirement to prove that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to whether the use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', nor 'that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to the manifest' nature of the violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. Ibid., Introduction to Article 8bis, §§ 2, 4.\n158 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\n159 Ibid.\n160 See also Resolution RC/Res.6*, supra note 81, Understandings 6-7.\n161 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 584 ('international law of state responsibility can and should govern the attribution of responsibility to states over cyberoperations'); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 84 (Rule 14: 'A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation'). In determining attribution for the purpose of state responsibility, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case looked to whether 'effective control' existed. Nicaragua case, supra note 39, § 115. See also International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries (adopted), UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), Arts 5, 8, 9, 11. By contrast, for the purpose of attributing the actions of a non-state armed group to a state in order to determine that an armed conflict is international, the test ultimately endorsed in the ICTY's Tadic case was whether the state exercised 'overall control' over the non-state actor(s). Judgment, Tadic (IT-94-1-A), Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, § 145. If the state incorporates non-state actors into its armed forces or attribution is otherwise satisfied, a number of listed acts of aggression could potentially apply.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.¹⁶²\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’,¹⁶³ and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’.¹⁶⁴ The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state.¹⁶⁵ One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state.¹⁶⁶ The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality.¹⁶⁷ Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations¹⁶⁸ — if they are valid¹⁶⁹ — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).¹⁷⁰\n¹⁶² See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n¹⁶³ Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n¹⁶⁴ Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n¹⁶⁵ See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n¹⁶⁶ See supra note 161 (attribution).\n¹⁶⁷ The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n¹⁶⁸ See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶⁹ See Trahan, supra note 44.\n¹⁷⁰ See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2).¹⁷¹ Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation,¹⁷² is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties.¹⁷³ Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.",
    "# 5. Conclusion": "This article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare¹⁷⁴ will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n¹⁷¹ See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n¹⁷² See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n¹⁷³ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n¹⁷⁴ See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies¹⁷⁵ — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks.¹⁷⁶ Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset,¹⁷⁷ could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n¹⁷⁵ While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n¹⁷⁶ As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n¹⁷⁷ Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted."

Introduction\nThis article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers). Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe. To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack). Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'. Many of the\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nwar crimes that could be committed during a conventional armed conflict could potentially also be committed through cyber means, or by employing both cyber and conventional weapons. Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities, hospitals, power grids, or a dam located upstream from a major city. One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.\norganizations and companies. See Greenberg, supra note 3. The 2008 attack on Georgia was also ‘blended’. See ICC Forum, ‘New Frontiers for the ICC (International Criminal Court): Tackling Cyber Attacks through the Crime of Aggression’ (22 February 2018), available online at https://iccforum.com/forum/permalink/110/13832 (visited 30 January 2021).\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others. Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state. Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n See e.g. S.M. Bellovin, S. Landau, and H.S. Lin, ‘Limiting the Undesired Impact of Cyber Weapons: Technical Requirements and Policy Implications’, 3 Journal of Cybersecurity (2017) 59; N.C. Rowe, ‘War Crimes from Cyberweapons’, 6 Journal of Information Warfare (2007) 15, available online at https://faculty.nps.edu/ncrowe/iwcrimes.htm (visited 30 January 2021) (‘Cyber-attacks can and should be designed to be selective in what systems they attack and what they attack in those systems’).\n See infra Section 3.B. (difficulties of attribution).\n This occurred with the NotPetya attack.\n States can design cyber-weapons to reduce proliferation risks and to reduce the ability of others to ‘repurpose’ cyber-weapons: Bellovin et al., supra note 13, at 60.\n See e.g. J. Taylor, ‘Chinese Cyberhackers “Blurring Line Between State Power and Crime”’, The Guardian (7 August 2019), available online at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/chinese-cyberhackers-blurring-line-between-state-power-and (visited 30 January 2021) (discussing a group of state-sponsored hackers in China).\n See K. Mačák, ‘On the Shelf, But Close At Hand: The Contribution of Non-State Initiatives to International Cyber Law’, AJIL Unbound (2019) 81, at 82 (‘Asymmetries of cyberspace mean that the most powerful nations are, in a peculiar way, also the most vulnerable ones’); Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 842 (‘Because it is much less costly to mount cyber-attacks than to launch conventional attacks, and because highly industrialized states are generally more dependent upon computer networks and are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks may prove to be a powerful weapon of the weak’).\n\nThis article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC's Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations. While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'. Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare. The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0', addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict. The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states, the author will proceed\n Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, finds that it is not the role of the pre-trial chamber to direct the Prosecutor as to what result she should reach in the gravity assessment or what weight she should assign to the individual factors').

See e.g. Cuba's Considerations on the Initial Pre-Draft of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/considerations-on-the-initial-pre-draft-of-the-oewg-cybersecurity-cuba-15-april.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1–2; China's Contribution to the Initial Pre-Draft of OEWG Report, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/china-contribution-to-oewg-pre-draft-report-final.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 5; Nicaragua's Considerations on the Initial Document of the Open-Ended Working Group on\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nbased on this same assumption. Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them, at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack. Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’. The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects. While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’).

They also suggest as criteria: military character, state involvement and ‘presumptive legality’ (that is, if the act is not forbidden by international law there is a presumption it is permitted). See 336, § 9(f)–(h).\n See Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, § 62, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/otp-policy_paper_preliminary_examinations_2013-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); see also §§ 64–65 (additional criteria); M. Roscini, ‘Gravity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and Cyber Conduct that Constitutes, Instigates or\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1141\nIt is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC's gravity threshold. For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold. On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'. Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations. Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted. Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

Part of the OTP’s analysis also rested on the conclusion that there was not ‘a reasonable basis to believe that senior [Israeli Defense Forces] commanders and Israeli leaders were responsible as perpetrators or planners’.

(That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’. They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’. This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold. For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’. While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’).

Similarly, the Netherlands has taken the view that a catastrophic systems attack that causes very serious economic impact could constitute an ‘armed attack’, and this also raises the question whether very serious economic impact would reach the threshold of Rome Statute gravity (again, assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

It is beyond the scope of the present article to address all variations in approach.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nfinancial hardship dramatically reducing their quality of life, and potentially, ability to receive medical care) necessarily less grave? The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49]\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes, so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n See e.g. K. Mačák, ‘Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer Data as Objects under International Humanitarian Law’, 48 Israel Law Review (2015) 55; J. Horowitz, ‘Cyber Operations under International Humanitarian Law: Perspectives from the ICRC’, 24 ASIL Insights (19 May 2020) (data includes ‘[m]edical data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client files, or electronic lists and records’). Horowitz notes that ‘[d]eleting, restricting, or tampering with essential civilian data can quickly bring government services and private businesses to a complete standstill’, and that the ICRC views ‘civilian data’ as ‘civilian objects’ for IHL purposes. Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n M.E. Cross, ‘Strategising International Prosecutions: How Might the Work of the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor’s Office Come to Be Judged?’ 20 International Criminal Law Review (2020) 43, at 67–68 (emphasis in original).\n Even when targeting a military adversary or objective, however, the means are not unlimited. See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established, in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable; thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral) even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation, issuing a warrant, and for confirmation of charges — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65]\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nrather than immediately recognize they have been subjected to an 'attack'. The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis. The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’. The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’. If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction. As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction. The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment. The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets, another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context). The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’. ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’. While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’. Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.\n United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch. XVIII, Penal Matters, ‘Amendments on the Crime of Aggression to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court’, as of 18 January 2021, available online at https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&amp;chapter=18⟨=en (visited 30 January 2021).\n See Arts 13(b), 15ter ICCSt. For background on Security Council referrals and the crime of aggression, see J.

(citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach), it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’. ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n J.

In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'. Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges. Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute\nAs mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force. '[C]yber operations are properly\n Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C. Slye and B. Van Schaack, Essentials: International Criminal Law (Aspen Publishers, 2009), at 92 ('It is generally accepted at the international level that treaties are to be treated as living documents. In other words, they are to be interpreted in the context of the time in which they are being applied, and not as they would have been interpreted at the time of their drafting').\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 329 (Rule 68).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1153\ncharacterized as a method of warfare when employed to harm or interfere with enemy forces, military objectives, the civilian population, or civilian objects. The Tallinn Manuals further take the view that, in a state of armed conflict (whether international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict), all the rules of international humanitarian law apply in the cyber-domain. The ICJ’s holding in the Nuclear Weapons case reinforces this as the court maintained that IHL applies to ‘all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons’. Cyber-operations may be employed during and in the context of an already existing armed conflict or they (either alone or in conjunction with conventional weapons) might, in theory, create the state of armed conflict. If cyber-operations are subject to IHL, then, for example, they may not target civilians or be targeted indiscriminately (both of which would violate the principle of distinction), and may not cause excessive ‘collateral damage’ (which would violate the principle of proportionality). Tallinn 2.0 expressly acknowledges that, when such IHL rules are violated, ‘[c]yber operations may\n Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 218.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 375 (Rule 80). But see supra note 26 (Tallinn not universally accepted).\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports (1996) 226, § 86 (the law of armed conflict ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’).\n It is more difficult to image cyber-operations creating the armed conflict but if the attacks cause deaths and/or destruction similar to a physical/kinetic attack, one can more readily envision this.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 422 (Rule 94: ‘The civilian population … shall not be the object of cyber attack’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(i) ICCSt. (war crime of directing attacks against the civilian population in international armed conflict); Art. 8(2)(e)(i) ICCSt. (same in non-international armed conflict). But see Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 852 (applying the principle of distinction becomes complex because ‘much of cyberspace is dual use’, with ‘[n]inety-five percent of military communications us[ing] civilian networks at some stage’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 455 (Rule 105: ‘It is prohibited to employ means or methods of cyber warfare that are indiscriminate by nature. [This occurs] when they cannot be: (a) directed at a specific military objective, or (b) limited in their effects as required by the laws of armed conflict, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction’). But see infra note 122 and accompanying text (annex missing for Rome Statute crime prohibiting ‘inherently indiscriminate’ weapons).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 470 (Rule 113: ‘A cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) ICCSt. (in international armed conflict, war crime of ‘intentionally launching at attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’). See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict, and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict. There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime, as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’. The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’. For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization. It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes (2011), Art 8(2)(a)(i) War Crime of Wilful Killing, Element 4, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n Ibid., Introduction to Art. 8, § (c).

(To meet the ‘intensity’ requirement the armed conflict must be ‘protracted’). See Art. 8(2)(f) ICCSt. (referencing ‘protracted armed conflict between ... [organized armed groups]’). As to the ‘organization’ requirement, there must be an ability to plan and carry out sustained military operations. Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities. Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU. Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’. The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii). Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n Greenberg, supra note 3; F.

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex. A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted. States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’. Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’. The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict. There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S. Clark, ‘Building on Article 8(2)(b)(xx) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: Weapons and Methods of Warfare’, 12 New Criminal Law Review (2009) 366.\n See Protocol I, Art. 51(4)(a)–(c) (prohibition of indiscriminate attacks); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 467, § 1 (the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks is customary international law). See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'.[127] The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.[128]\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack[129] was 'widespread' or 'systematic';[130] and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy';[131] so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction.[132] The same cyber-operation, if it could\n\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution. Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met. Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’. As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group). This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances. As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group. While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group. The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’. Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes. Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda, the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n See supra note 57.\n See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\ncyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology, or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means. (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression' constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'. The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Times (15 October 2018), available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html (visited 30 January 2021). Mozur writes: They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’, and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’. The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state. One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state. The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality. Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations — if they are valid — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).\n See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n See supra note 161 (attribution).\n The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n See Trahan, supra note 44.\n See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2). Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation, is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties. Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks. Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset, could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted.",

Introduction\nThis article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers). Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe. To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack). Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'. Many of the\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nwar crimes that could be committed during a conventional armed conflict could potentially also be committed through cyber means, or by employing both cyber and conventional weapons. Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities, hospitals, power grids, or a dam located upstream from a major city. One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.\norganizations and companies. See Greenberg, supra note 3. The 2008 attack on Georgia was also ‘blended’. See ICC Forum, ‘New Frontiers for the ICC (International Criminal Court): Tackling Cyber Attacks through the Crime of Aggression’ (22 February 2018), available online at https://iccforum.com/forum/permalink/110/13832 (visited 30 January 2021).\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others. Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state. Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n See e.g. S.M. Bellovin, S. Landau, and H.S. Lin, ‘Limiting the Undesired Impact of Cyber Weapons: Technical Requirements and Policy Implications’, 3 Journal of Cybersecurity (2017) 59; N.C. Rowe, ‘War Crimes from Cyberweapons’, 6 Journal of Information Warfare (2007) 15, available online at https://faculty.nps.edu/ncrowe/iwcrimes.htm (visited 30 January 2021) (‘Cyber-attacks can and should be designed to be selective in what systems they attack and what they attack in those systems’).\n See infra Section 3.B. (difficulties of attribution).\n This occurred with the NotPetya attack.\n States can design cyber-weapons to reduce proliferation risks and to reduce the ability of others to ‘repurpose’ cyber-weapons: Bellovin et al., supra note 13, at 60.\n See e.g. J. Taylor, ‘Chinese Cyberhackers “Blurring Line Between State Power and Crime”’, The Guardian (7 August 2019), available online at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/chinese-cyberhackers-blurring-line-between-state-power-and (visited 30 January 2021) (discussing a group of state-sponsored hackers in China).\n See K. Mačák, ‘On the Shelf, But Close At Hand: The Contribution of Non-State Initiatives to International Cyber Law’, AJIL Unbound (2019) 81, at 82 (‘Asymmetries of cyberspace mean that the most powerful nations are, in a peculiar way, also the most vulnerable ones’); Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 842 (‘Because it is much less costly to mount cyber-attacks than to launch conventional attacks, and because highly industrialized states are generally more dependent upon computer networks and are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks may prove to be a powerful weapon of the weak’).\n\nThis article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC's Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations. While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'. Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare. The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0', addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict. The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states, the author will proceed\n Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, finds that it is not the role of the pre-trial chamber to direct the Prosecutor as to what result she should reach in the gravity assessment or what weight she should assign to the individual factors').

See e.g. Cuba's Considerations on the Initial Pre-Draft of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/considerations-on-the-initial-pre-draft-of-the-oewg-cybersecurity-cuba-15-april.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1–2; China's Contribution to the Initial Pre-Draft of OEWG Report, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/china-contribution-to-oewg-pre-draft-report-final.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 5; Nicaragua's Considerations on the Initial Document of the Open-Ended Working Group on\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nbased on this same assumption. Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them, at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack. Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’. The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects. While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’).

For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold. On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'. Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations. Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted. Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

(That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’. They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’. This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold. For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’. While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’).

See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N.

Similarly, the Netherlands has taken the view that a catastrophic systems attack that causes very serious economic impact could constitute an ‘armed attack’, and this also raises the question whether very serious economic impact would reach the threshold of Rome Statute gravity (again, assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49]\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes, so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n See e.g. K. Mačák, ‘Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer Data as Objects under International Humanitarian Law’, 48 Israel Law Review (2015) 55; J. Horowitz, ‘Cyber Operations under International Humanitarian Law: Perspectives from the ICRC’, 24 ASIL Insights (19 May 2020) (data includes ‘[m]edical data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client files, or electronic lists and records’). Horowitz notes that ‘[d]eleting, restricting, or tampering with essential civilian data can quickly bring government services and private businesses to a complete standstill’, and that the ICRC views ‘civilian data’ as ‘civilian objects’ for IHL purposes. Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n M.E. Cross, ‘Strategising International Prosecutions: How Might the Work of the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor’s Office Come to Be Judged?’ 20 International Criminal Law Review (2020) 43, at 67–68 (emphasis in original).\n Even when targeting a military adversary or objective, however, the means are not unlimited. See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established, in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable; thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral) even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation, issuing a warrant, and for confirmation of charges — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65]\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nrather than immediately recognize they have been subjected to an 'attack'. The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis. The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’. The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’. If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction. As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction. The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment. The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets, another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context). The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’. ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’. While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’. Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.\n United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch.

Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach), it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’. ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n J.

In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'. Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges. Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute\nAs mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force. '[C]yber operations are properly\n Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C. Slye and B. Van Schaack, Essentials: International Criminal Law (Aspen Publishers, 2009), at 92 ('It is generally accepted at the international level that treaties are to be treated as living documents. In other words, they are to be interpreted in the context of the time in which they are being applied, and not as they would have been interpreted at the time of their drafting').\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 329 (Rule 68).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1153\ncharacterized as a method of warfare when employed to harm or interfere with enemy forces, military objectives, the civilian population, or civilian objects. The Tallinn Manuals further take the view that, in a state of armed conflict (whether international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict), all the rules of international humanitarian law apply in the cyber-domain. The ICJ’s holding in the Nuclear Weapons case reinforces this as the court maintained that IHL applies to ‘all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons’. Cyber-operations may be employed during and in the context of an already existing armed conflict or they (either alone or in conjunction with conventional weapons) might, in theory, create the state of armed conflict. If cyber-operations are subject to IHL, then, for example, they may not target civilians or be targeted indiscriminately (both of which would violate the principle of distinction), and may not cause excessive ‘collateral damage’ (which would violate the principle of proportionality). Tallinn 2.0 expressly acknowledges that, when such IHL rules are violated, ‘[c]yber operations may\n Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 218.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 375 (Rule 80). But see supra note 26 (Tallinn not universally accepted).\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports (1996) 226, § 86 (the law of armed conflict ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’).\n It is more difficult to image cyber-operations creating the armed conflict but if the attacks cause deaths and/or destruction similar to a physical/kinetic attack, one can more readily envision this.\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 422 (Rule 94: ‘The civilian population … shall not be the object of cyber attack’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(i) ICCSt. (war crime of directing attacks against the civilian population in international armed conflict); Art. 8(2)(e)(i) ICCSt. (same in non-international armed conflict). But see Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 852 (applying the principle of distinction becomes complex because ‘much of cyberspace is dual use’, with ‘[n]inety-five percent of military communications us[ing] civilian networks at some stage’).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 455 (Rule 105: ‘It is prohibited to employ means or methods of cyber warfare that are indiscriminate by nature. [This occurs] when they cannot be: (a) directed at a specific military objective, or (b) limited in their effects as required by the laws of armed conflict, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction’). But see infra note 122 and accompanying text (annex missing for Rome Statute crime prohibiting ‘inherently indiscriminate’ weapons).\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 470 (Rule 113: ‘A cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) ICCSt. (in international armed conflict, war crime of ‘intentionally launching at attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’). See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict, and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict. There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime, as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’. The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’. For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization. It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

(To meet the ‘intensity’ requirement the armed conflict must be ‘protracted’). See Art. 8(2)(f) ICCSt. (referencing ‘protracted armed conflict between ... [organized armed groups]’). As to the ‘organization’ requirement, there must be an ability to plan and carry out sustained military operations. Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities. Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU. Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’. The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii). Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n Greenberg, supra note 3; F.

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex. A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted. States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’. Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’. The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict. There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S. Clark, ‘Building on Article 8(2)(b)(xx) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: Weapons and Methods of Warfare’, 12 New Criminal Law Review (2009) 366.\n See Protocol I, Art. 51(4)(a)–(c) (prohibition of indiscriminate attacks); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 467, § 1 (the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks is customary international law). See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'.[127] The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.[128]\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack[129] was 'widespread' or 'systematic';[130] and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy';[131] so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction.[132] The same cyber-operation, if it could\n\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution. Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met. Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’. As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group). This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances. As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group. While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group. The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’. Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes. Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda, the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n See supra note 57.\n See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\ncyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology, or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means. (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression' constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'. The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’, and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’. The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state. One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state. The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality. Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations — if they are valid — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).\n See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n See supra note 161 (attribution).\n The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n See Trahan, supra note 44.\n See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2). Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation, is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties. Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks. Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset, could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted."

Introduction\nThis article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).¹ While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers).² Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes\n¹ ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n² The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe.³ To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack).⁴ Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss⁵ and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.⁶\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'.⁷ Many of the\n3 This occurred with the infamous NotPetya attack. See A. Greenberg, 'The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History', Wired (22 August 2018), available online at https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ (visited 30 January 2021).

Most experts believe it to have been perpetrated by the US and Israel. E. Nakashima and J. Warrick, 'Stuxnet Was Work of U.S. and Israeli Experts, Officials Say', Washington Post (2 June 2012), available online at https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html (visited 30 January 2021).\n5 See Greenberg, supra note 3 (estimating nine-figure costs in multiple situations).\n6 E.T.

Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities,⁸ hospitals,⁹ power grids,¹⁰ or a dam located upstream from a major city.¹¹ One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.¹²\norganizations and companies.

Hathaway et al., ‘The Law of Cyber Attack’, California Law Review (2012) 817, at 834 (differentiating cyber-attacks from cyber-crime). See also supra note 1. Arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute, with the possible exception of those in Ukraine. See infra notes 116–121 and accompanying text (discussing cyber-attacks in Ukraine). Potentially, the genocide in Myanmar was cyber-enabled: see infra note 150. However, the ICC lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed solely within Myanmar. See infra note 75 and accompanying text. The genocide against the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted¹³ — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.¹⁴) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target¹⁵ and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others.¹⁶ Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state.¹⁷ Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.¹⁸\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n¹³ See e.g. S.M.

While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.¹⁹\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'.²⁰ Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.²¹\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n¹⁹ This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n²⁰ Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n²¹ Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.²²\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare.²³ The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0',²⁴ addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict.²⁵ The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states,²⁶ the author will proceed\n²² Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them,²⁷ at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.²⁸\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.²⁹) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack.³⁰ Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’.³¹ The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects.³² While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.³³\nProgress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n²⁷ Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n²⁸ Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n²⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’). Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ (emphasis added).\n³⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 330 (Rule 69 states: ‘A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when it has scale and effects … comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’).\n³¹ Ibid., at 332, § 8.\n³² Ibid., at 333–336, § 9(a)–(e). They also suggest as criteria: military character, state involvement and ‘presumptive legality’ (that is, if the act is not forbidden by international law there is a presumption it is permitted). See 336, § 9(f)–(h).\n³³ See Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, § 62, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/otp-policy_paper_preliminary_examinations_2013-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); see also §§ 64–65 (additional criteria); M. Roscini, ‘Gravity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and Cyber Conduct that Constitutes, Instigates or\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1141\nIt is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC's gravity threshold. For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold.³⁴ On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'.³⁵ Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations.³⁶ Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted.³⁷ Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n³⁴ The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’, 67 UCLA Law Review (2020) 520.\n³⁷ See Judgment and Sentence, Al Mahdi (ICC-01/12-01/15-171), Trial Chamber VIII, 27 September 2016, §§ 77, 79–82 (recalling that crimes against property may be of lesser gravity compared to crimes against the person, but taking into account the character of the objects and their legal status). For discussion of a cyber-operation targeting hospitals in Ukraine, see text accompanying note 116 infra.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nthe gravity threshold for cyber-operations that satisfy the Rome Statute’s gravity requirement.\nThe Tallinn experts additionally considered what would constitute an ‘armed attack’ in the cyber-domain. (That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter³⁸ — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’.³⁹ They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁰ This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.⁴¹\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold.⁴² For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’.⁴³ While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n³⁸ Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n³⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’). The United States maintains that there is no difference between a ‘use of force’ and an ‘armed attack’. Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 7.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 341, § 8 (emphasis added).\n⁴¹ See ICC Forum, supra note 7 (‘[i]f the [P]rosecutor chooses a case where the effects are not easily shown to be analogous to previous kinetic attacks, then she risks invalidating the court and the crime’s serious nature’).\n⁴² The Tallinn experts similarly left a door open when they suggested that in other situations (other than where there is injury or killing of persons or physical damage or destruction of objects) what constitutes ‘use of force’ is ‘less clear’: Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 8. See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n⁴³ Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N.

Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.⁴⁶\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure\n⁴⁴ Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n⁴⁵ The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena.

It is beyond the scope of the present article to address all variations in approach.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nfinancial hardship dramatically reducing their quality of life, and potentially, ability to receive medical care) necessarily less grave? The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force'; yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss? What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas. Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included. This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n47 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n48 The author refers to the NotPetya attack that spread to Maersk and other companies around the world. See Greenberg, supra note 3. But see Section 3.D infra (the ICC's intent requirement likely excludes responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limits responsibility even for foreseen consequences).\n49 This also occurred during the NotPetya attack which took place in conjunction with offensive military operations by Russian forces into Ukraine. Greenberg, supra note 3.\n50 For example, Bemba focused on command responsibility for mass rape, murder, and pillage, charged as crimes against humanity and war crimes; Lubanga focused on the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate in hostilities; and al Mahdi resulted in a guilty plea to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion. Although the charges in the last two cases were seen as somewhat ground-breaking when brought, admittedly, the cyber-domain would represent even more novel territory.\n51 Another reason to read ICC 'gravity' as requiring a fairly high threshold is that one would not want any confusion that it lowers the threshold for what constitutes an 'armed attack' in the cyber-realm, which could carry significant consequences as an 'armed attack' permits the exercise of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71).\n52 There is controversy whether data should be considered an 'object' under IHL. See J.T. Biller and M.N. Schmitt, 'Classification of Cyber Capabilities and Operations as Weapons, Means, or Methods of Warfare', 95 International Law Studies (2019) 179, at 181.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145\ndestruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.⁵³\nAny circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result⁵⁴ — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.⁵⁵\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes,⁵⁶ so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n⁵³ See e.g. K.

See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\noccurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established,⁵⁷ in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable;⁵⁸ thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive⁵⁹ that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral)⁶⁰ even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.⁶¹ Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation,⁶² issuing a warrant,⁶³ and for confirmation of charges⁶⁴ — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n⁵⁷ See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n⁵⁸ The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n⁵⁹ See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n⁶⁰ Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n⁶¹ Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations, states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran]. Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations. Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally. Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n65 N. Tsagourias, 'Cyber Attacks, Self-Defense and the Problem of Attribution', 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (2012) 229, 233. See Dederer and Singer, supra note 61, at 438 ('it is still nearly impossible to trace a cyber-operation with absolute certainty to a particular computer system and, more importantly, to its author') (citing sources).\n66 Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 843.\n67 J.

The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n72 See A. Lubin, 'Politics, Power Dynamics, and the Limits of Existing Self-Regulation and Oversight in ICC Preliminary Examinations' (making this suggestion), in M. Bergsmo and C. Stahn (eds), Quality Control in Preliminary Examination: Vol. 2 (Torkel Opsahl Academic EPublisher, 2018) 78, 141–143.\n73 There is an entire body of jurisdiction based on the 'effects' test. See e.g. The S.S. 'Lotus' (France v. Turkey), P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 10, p. 4 (1927). However, for the ICC's purposes, the more salient inquiry appears to be whether one element of the crime occurred on the territory of a state party (objective territoriality). See infra note 75.\n74 See Art. 12(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt. See also Art. 12(3) ICCSt.\n75 Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the People's Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Situation in Bangladesh/Myanmar (ICC-01/19-27), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 1 November 2019 ('Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision'), § 61.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis.⁷⁶ The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.⁷⁷\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’.⁷⁸ The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’.⁷⁹ If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction.⁸⁰ As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment⁸¹ and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction.⁸² The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment⁸³ — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n⁷⁶ Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 55-56, §§ 3-4 (Rule 9).\n⁷⁹ Ibid., § 2.\n⁸⁰ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n⁸¹ The Crime of Aggression, RC/Res.6*, Review Conference of the Rome Statute, adopted 11 June 2010, by consensus, available online at https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/docs/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸² Activation of the Jurisdiction of the Court Over the Crime of Aggression, ICC-ASP/16/Res.5, 14 December 2017 (‘Activating Resolution’), available online at https://asp.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/ASP16/ICC-ASP-16-Res5-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸³ There is an argument that the jurisdictional limitations, which arguably came about only in the Activating Resolution, were ineffective to modify the original jurisdictional agreement in the Kampala amendment. See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nexist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment.⁸⁴ The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.⁸⁵\n## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets,⁸⁶ another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context).⁸⁷ The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁸ ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁹ While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’.⁹⁰ Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.⁹¹\n⁸⁴ United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch. XVIII, Penal Matters, ‘Amendments on the Crime of Aggression to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court’, as of 18 January 2021, available online at https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&amp;chapter=18⟨=en (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸⁵ See Arts 13(b), 15ter ICCSt. For background on Security Council referrals and the crime of aggression, see J.

(citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).⁹²) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach),⁹³ it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’.⁹⁴ ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.⁹⁵\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n⁹² J.

In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'.⁹⁶ Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges.⁹⁷ Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute\nAs mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force.⁹⁸ '[C]yber operations are properly\n⁹⁶ Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n⁹⁷ UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C.

See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\namount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.¹⁰⁶\nUnder the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’¹⁰⁷ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict,¹⁰⁸ and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime,¹¹⁰ as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.¹¹¹\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’.¹¹² The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’.¹¹³ For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization.¹¹⁴ It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n¹⁰⁶ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n¹⁰⁷ Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n¹⁰⁸ The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

Decision on the\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155\norganizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.¹¹⁵\nThe cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities.¹¹⁶ Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU.¹¹⁷ Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population,¹¹⁸ or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’.¹¹⁹ The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii).¹²⁰ Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.¹²¹\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n¹¹⁵ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n¹¹⁶ Greenberg, supra note 3; F.

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex.¹²² A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted.¹²³ States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute\nThe hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’.¹²⁴ Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’.¹²⁵ The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict.¹²⁶ There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s\nSeptember 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n¹²² For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S. Clark, ‘Building on Article 8(2)(b)(xx) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: Weapons and Methods of Warfare’, 12 New Criminal Law Review (2009) 366.\n¹²³ See Protocol I, Art. 51(4)(a)–(c) (prohibition of indiscriminate attacks); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 467, § 1 (the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks is customary international law). See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n¹²⁴ Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n¹²⁵ Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n¹²⁶ See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157\n'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'. The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.\nReturning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack was 'widespread' or 'systematic'; and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy'; so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction. The same cyber-operation, if it could\n127 See e.g. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 7(1) (a) Crime against humanity of murder, Elements 1-2. The contextual elements have been enumerated as requiring 'i) an attack directed against any civilian population; (ii) a State or organizational policy; (iii) an attack of a widespread or systematic nature; (iv) a nexus ... between the individual act and the attack; and (v) knowledge of the attack'. See Corrigendum to 'Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of the Côte d'Ivoire', Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (ICC-02/11-14-Corr), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 5 November 2011, § 29.\n128 For the precise terminology, see Art. 7(1)(a)-(k) ICCSt.\n129 There is also the requirement of proof of a nexus between the underlying crime(s) and the attack, but in this scenario the murders result directly from the cyber-operation opening the dams; thus, the nexus appears met.\n130 In the facts suggested, the ramifications could be considered 'widespread' if there are a large number of victims; that there were several attacks on the dams could alternatively be considered 'systematic'. One would only require proof of one. See Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Bosco Ntaganda, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-309), Pre-Trial Chamber II, 9 June 2014, § 24 (finding an attack 'widespread' considering the 'large number of civilian victims', the 'broad geographical area' involved, and the duration of the attack); Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, Al Bashir (ICC-02/05-01/09-3), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 4 March 2009, § 81 ('[t]he term, \"systematic\" pertains to the organized nature of the acts of violence and to the improbability of their random occurrence').\n131 As to the 'policy', proof may be inferred from a variety of factors, such as whether (i) the attack was planned, directed or organized; (ii) a recurring pattern of violence; (iii) the use of public or private resources to further the policy; (iv) involvement of the State or organizational forces in the commission of crimes; (v) statements, instructions or documentation attributable to the State or the organization condoning or encouraging the commission of crimes; and/or (vi) an underlying motivation'. See Judgment, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343), Trial Chamber III, 21 March 2016, § 160.\n132 The crime could additionally constitute 'extermination', which is large-scale killing. Because the 'attack' could also constitute an 'armed attack', it is possible these facts could alternatively be analyzed as a war crime, particularly if the penetration of the dams trigger 'armed conflict' and there are different states involved. The same facts also could constitute the 'crime of aggression' if a number of additional elements are met. See infra Section 4.D.\n1158\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nbe shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution.¹³³ Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’.¹³⁴ Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.¹³⁵\nWhile there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met.¹³⁶ Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).¹³⁷\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’.¹³⁸ As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group).¹³⁹ This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n¹³³ Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n¹³⁴ Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n¹³⁵ It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n¹³⁶ See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n¹³⁷ See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n¹³⁸ Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n¹³⁹ Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159\nmay be inferred from the circumstances.¹⁴⁰ As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group.¹⁴¹ While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime¹⁴² — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.¹⁴³\nIn addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group.¹⁴⁴ The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’¹⁴⁵ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes.¹⁴⁷ Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda,¹⁴⁸ the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a\n¹⁴⁰ Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n¹⁴¹ Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n¹⁴² See supra note 57.\n¹⁴³ See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴⁴ Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁵ Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n¹⁴⁶ Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁷ An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n¹⁴⁸ For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\ncyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology,¹⁴⁹ or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means.¹⁵⁰ (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.¹⁵¹) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).¹⁵²\n## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute\nWhile the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression'¹⁵³ constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'.¹⁵⁴ The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political\n¹⁴⁹ One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Mozur, 'A Genocide Incited on Facebook, With Posts from Myanmar's Military', N.Y.

Mozur writes: They posed as fans of pop stars and national heroes as they flooded Facebook with their hatred. One said Islam was a global threat to Buddhism. Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n¹⁵¹ Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n¹⁵² See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n¹⁵³ Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n¹⁵⁴ Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161\nindependence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159\nAccordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause'\n155 Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt. Thus, individual and collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and operations authorized under Chapter VII are both excluded.\n156 Ibid. The list additionally is not exhaustive because Article 8bis(2), second sentence, states that the following acts 'shall' qualify, suggesting the list is open-ended, subject to the requirements in Article 8bis(1).\n157 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt. Additionally, the perpetrator must have been 'aware of the factual circumstances that established that such a use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', and 'aware of the factual circumstances that established such a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Article 8bis Crime of aggression, Element 6. But '[t]here is no requirement to prove that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to whether the use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', nor 'that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to the manifest' nature of the violation of the Charter of the United Nations'. Ibid., Introduction to Article 8bis, §§ 2, 4.\n158 Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\n159 Ibid.\n160 See also Resolution RC/Res.6*, supra note 81, Understandings 6-7.\n161 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 584 ('international law of state responsibility can and should govern the attribution of responsibility to states over cyberoperations'); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 84 (Rule 14: 'A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation'). In determining attribution for the purpose of state responsibility, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case looked to whether 'effective control' existed. Nicaragua case, supra note 39, § 115. See also International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries (adopted), UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), Arts 5, 8, 9, 11. By contrast, for the purpose of attributing the actions of a non-state armed group to a state in order to determine that an armed conflict is international, the test ultimately endorsed in the ICTY's Tadic case was whether the state exercised 'overall control' over the non-state actor(s). Judgment, Tadic (IT-94-1-A), Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, § 145. If the state incorporates non-state actors into its armed forces or attribution is otherwise satisfied, a number of listed acts of aggression could potentially apply.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n(probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.¹⁶²\nWhile the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’,¹⁶³ and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’.¹⁶⁴ The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state.¹⁶⁵ One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state.¹⁶⁶ The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality.¹⁶⁷ Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations¹⁶⁸ — if they are valid¹⁶⁹ — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).¹⁷⁰\n¹⁶² See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n¹⁶³ Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n¹⁶⁴ Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n¹⁶⁵ See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n¹⁶⁶ See supra note 161 (attribution).\n¹⁶⁷ The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n¹⁶⁸ See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶⁹ See Trahan, supra note 44.\n¹⁷⁰ See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2).¹⁷¹ Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation,¹⁷² is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties.¹⁷³ Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare¹⁷⁴ will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties. See Art. 15bis(5), ICCSt.\n¹⁷¹ See e.g. S.J. Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n¹⁷² See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n¹⁷³ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n¹⁷⁴ See supra note 2.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\nits relevance for states with developed economies¹⁷⁵ — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks.¹⁷⁶ Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset,¹⁷⁷ could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n¹⁷⁵ While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n¹⁷⁶ As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n¹⁷⁷ Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted."

Introduction This article examines how a cyber-operation (an activity enabled by conduct in cyberspace) that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack (causing serious loss of life or physical damage) could be encompassed within the crimes that may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).¹ While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers).² Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, met the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.\nRecognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes ¹ ‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under *jus ad bellum*.\n² The expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare is a welcome addition in exploring these significant topics. See *The Council of Advisers’ Report on The Application of The Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court to Cyberwarfare*, prepared by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2021). Expert meetings of the Council of Advisers were hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and co-organized by the Permanent Missions of Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as the Global Institute for the Prevention of Aggression. The author as well as other members of the Council of Advisers contributed to the writing of the expert report, with the bulk of the writing supervised by Liechtenstein legal adviser Sina Alavi.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135 that are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n## 2. Background The past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe.³ To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack).⁴ Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss⁵ and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.⁶ The use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'.⁷ Many of the JICJ (2021) 1133-1164 war crimes that could be committed during a conventional armed conflict could potentially also be committed through cyber means, or by employing both cyber and conventional weapons. Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities,⁸ hospitals,⁹ power grids,¹⁰ or a dam located upstream from a major city.¹¹ One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.¹² organizations and companies. See Greenberg, supra note 3. The 2008 attack on Georgia was also ‘blended’. See ICC Forum, ‘New Frontiers for the ICC (International Criminal Court): Tackling Cyber Attacks through the Crime of Aggression’ (22 February 2018), available online at https://iccforum.com/forum/permalink/110/13832 (visited 30 January 2021).\n\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137 Ideally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted¹³ — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.¹⁴) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target¹⁵ and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others.¹⁶ Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state.¹⁷ Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.¹⁸ Uighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n¹³ See e.g. S.M. Bellovin, S. Landau, and H.S. Lin, ‘Limiting the Undesired Impact of Cyber Weapons: Technical Requirements and Policy Implications’, 3 Journal of Cybersecurity (2017) 59; N.C. Rowe, ‘War Crimes from Cyberweapons’, 6 Journal of Information Warfare (2007) 15, available online at https://faculty.nps.edu/ncrowe/iwcrimes.htm (visited 30 January 2021) (‘Cyber-attacks can and should be designed to be selective in what systems they attack and what they attack in those systems’).\n¹⁴ See infra Section 3.B. (difficulties of attribution).\n¹⁵ This occurred with the NotPetya attack.\n¹⁶ States can design cyber-weapons to reduce proliferation risks and to reduce the ability of others to ‘repurpose’ cyber-weapons: Bellovin et al., supra note 13, at 60.\n¹⁷ See e.g. J. Taylor, ‘Chinese Cyberhackers “Blurring Line Between State Power and Crime”’, The Guardian (7 August 2019), available online at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/chinese-cyberhackers-blurring-line-between-state-power-and (visited 30 January 2021) (discussing a group of state-sponsored hackers in China).\n¹⁸ See K. Mačák, ‘On the Shelf, But Close At Hand: The Contribution of Non-State Initiatives to International Cyber Law’, AJIL Unbound (2019) 81, at 82 (‘Asymmetries of cyberspace mean that the most powerful nations are, in a peculiar way, also the most vulnerable ones’); Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 842 (‘Because it is much less costly to mount cyber-attacks than to launch conventional attacks, and because highly industrialized states are generally more dependent upon computer networks and are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks may prove to be a powerful weapon of the weak’).\n\nThis article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC's Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations. While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.¹⁹ ## 3. Overarching Considerations ### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify... action by the Court'.²⁰ Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.²¹ A recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement: [T]he gravity requirement... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'....\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It ¹⁹ This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n²⁰ Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n²¹ Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139 further noted that some factors... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination.... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.²² Given the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare.²³ The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0',²⁴ addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict.²⁵ The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states,²⁶ the author will proceed ²² Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

(ICC-01/13-98 OA2), Appeals Chamber, 2 September 2019, § 81 ('the Appeals Chamber... considers that the Prosecutor enjoys a margin of appreciation, which the pre-trial chamber has to respect when reviewing the Prosecutor's decision [on gravity]. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, finds that it is not the role of the pre-trial chamber to direct the Prosecutor as to what result she should reach in the gravity assessment or what weight she should assign to the individual factors').

See e.g. Cuba's Considerations on the Initial Pre-Draft of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/considerations-on-the-initial-pre-draft-of-the-oewg-cybersecurity-cuba-15-april.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1–2; China's Contribution to the Initial Pre-Draft of OEWG Report, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/china-contribution-to-oewg-pre-draft-report-final.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 5; Nicaragua's Considerations on the Initial Document of the Open-Ended Working Group on JICJ (2021) 1133-1164 based on this same assumption. Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them,²⁷ at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.²⁸ While the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.²⁹) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack.³⁰ Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’.³¹ The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects.³² While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment. They are similar to the ‘gravity’ criteria suggested by the Prosecutor in the Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations.³³ Progress in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (not denying ‘in principle’ the applicability of international law, but calling the situation a ‘legal vacuum’), available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/minic-mis-143-04-2020-permanent-mission-of-switzerland.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 3–4; Commentary of The Russian Federation on the Initial ‘Pre-Draft’ of the Final Report of the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, available online at https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/russian-commentary-on-oweg-zero-draft-report-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), at 1.\n²⁷ Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n²⁸ Ibid., at 648 (calling the Tallinn Rules ‘normative points of reference, around which customary international law and treaty interpretation can further coalesce’).\n²⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 337, § 11 (‘The “use of force” standard is employed to determine whether a State has violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and its related customary international law prohibition’). Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ (emphasis added).\n³⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 330 (Rule 69 states: ‘A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when it has scale and effects … comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’).\n³¹ Ibid., at 332, § 8.\n³² Ibid., at 333–336, § 9(a)–(e). They also suggest as criteria: military character, state involvement and ‘presumptive legality’ (that is, if the act is not forbidden by international law there is a presumption it is permitted). See 336, § 9(f)–(h).\n³³ See Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, § 62, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/otp-policy_paper_preliminary_examinations_2013-eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); see also §§ 64–65 (additional criteria); M. Roscini, ‘Gravity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court and Cyber Conduct that Constitutes, Instigates or Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1141 It is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC's gravity threshold. For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold.³⁴ On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'.³⁵ Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations.³⁶ Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted.³⁷ Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining Facilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n³⁴ The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’. OTP, Report on Preliminary Examination Activities (2017) - Registered Vessels of Comoros, Greece and Cambodia, 4 December 2017, § 336, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=2017-otp-rep-PE-Comoros (visited 30 January 2021). Part of the OTP’s analysis also rested on the conclusion that there was not ‘a reasonable basis to believe that senior [Israeli Defense Forces] commanders and Israeli leaders were responsible as perpetrators or planners’.

Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’, 67 UCLA Law Review (2020) 520.\n³⁷ See Judgment and Sentence, Al Mahdi (ICC-01/12-01/15-171), Trial Chamber VIII, 27 September 2016, §§ 77, 79–82 (recalling that crimes against property may be of lesser gravity compared to crimes against the person, but taking into account the character of the objects and their legal status). For discussion of a cyber-operation targeting hospitals in Ukraine, see text accompanying note 116 infra.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 the gravity threshold for cyber-operations that satisfy the Rome Statute’s gravity requirement.\nThe Tallinn experts additionally considered what would constitute an ‘armed attack’ in the cyber-domain. (That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter³⁸ — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’.³⁹ They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁰ This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.⁴¹ At the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold.⁴² For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’.⁴³ While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of ³⁸ Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n³⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’). The United States maintains that there is no difference between a ‘use of force’ and an ‘armed attack’. Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 7.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 341, § 8 (emphasis added).\n⁴¹ See ICC Forum, supra note 7 (‘[i]f the [P]rosecutor chooses a case where the effects are not easily shown to be analogous to previous kinetic attacks, then she risks invalidating the court and the crime’s serious nature’).\n⁴² The Tallinn experts similarly left a door open when they suggested that in other situations (other than where there is injury or killing of persons or physical damage or destruction of objects) what constitutes ‘use of force’ is ‘less clear’: Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 333, § 8. See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 592 (criticizing the Tallinn experts for failing to ‘agree to treat operations lacking physical consequences also as potential use of force’).\n⁴³ Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace, available online at droit-internat-appliqué-aux-opérations-cyberespace-france.pdf (justsecurity.org) (visited 30 January 2021), as cited in M.N. Schmitt, ‘France’s Major Statement on International Law and Cyber: An Assessment’, Just Security (16 September 2019), available online at https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/droit-internat-appliqu%C3%A9-aux-op%C3%A9rations-cyberespace-france.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1143 systems or critical infrastructure — at least where there is no proximately ensuing loss of life or serious physical destruction.⁴⁴ Similarly, the Netherlands has taken the view that a catastrophic systems attack that causes very serious economic impact could constitute an ‘armed attack’,⁴⁵ and this also raises the question whether very serious economic impact would reach the threshold of Rome Statute gravity (again, assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.⁴⁶ These are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms? Is a stock market crash (that maybe causes widespread harm to large numbers of elderly pensioners who then endure ⁴⁴ Penetration of systems or critical infrastructure (without additional harm resulting) also may not satisfy the actus reus requirement of Rome Statute crimes, apart from possibly the crime of aggression. Note, here, however, France (along with the UK) was one of the states trying to limit the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression, so that a state party that had not ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment (such as France and the UK) would not be part of the jurisdictional regime. See J. Trahan, ‘From Kampala to New York — The Final Negotiations to Activate the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court Over the Crime of Aggression’, 18 International Criminal Law Review (2018) 197.\n⁴⁵ The Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, suggested that if ‘a cyber-attack targets the entire Dutch financial system … or if it prevents the government from carrying out essential tasks such as policing or taxation … it would qualify as an armed attack’.

See Section 4.B. infra (discussing crimes against humanity). In addition to France and the Netherlands, several additional states (e.g. Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) have opined on a number of the issues covered in the Tallinn Manuals, including application of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber-arena. See e.g. Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020, available online at https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/cyber-security/strategy (visited 30 January 2021); Republic of Estonia Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–2022, available online at https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strategia_2022_eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); Finland’s Cyber Security Strategy 2019, available online at https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/en/finlands-cyber-security-strategy-2019 (visited 30 January 2021); Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2016, available online at https://www.bmi.bund.de/cybersicherheitsstrategie/BMI_CyberSicherheitsStrategie.pdf(in German) (visited 30 January 2021); New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy 2019, available online at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-07/Cyber%20Security%20Strategy.pdf (visited 30 January 2021); UK National Cyber Security Strategy 2016 to 2021, available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-security-strategy-2016-to-2021 (visited 30 January 2021); National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, available online at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf (visited 30 January 2021). It is beyond the scope of the present article to address all variations in approach.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 financial hardship dramatically reducing their quality of life, and potentially, ability to receive medical care) necessarily less grave? The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49] These questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1145 destruction would reach the ICC's gravity threshold, but it is possible that destruction of data, in certain circumstances, should be included.⁵³ Any circumstances in which the ICC were to pursue a case concerning a cyber-operation of sufficient gravity would be significant in itself — and would make clear that the Rome Statute does encompass certain cyber-operations (even if they are a very limited subset of all such operations). This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result⁵⁴ — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes: Increasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.⁵⁵ Gravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes,⁵⁶ so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have ⁵³ See e.g. K. Mačák, ‘Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer Data as Objects under International Humanitarian Law’, 48 Israel Law Review (2015) 55; J. Horowitz, ‘Cyber Operations under International Humanitarian Law: Perspectives from the ICRC’, 24 ASIL Insights (19 May 2020) (data includes ‘[m]edical data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client files, or electronic lists and records’). Horowitz notes that ‘[d]eleting, restricting, or tampering with essential civilian data can quickly bring government services and private businesses to a complete standstill’, and that the ICRC views ‘civilian data’ as ‘civilian objects’ for IHL purposes. Compare Art. 8(2)(b)(ii) ICCSt. (war crime of attacks on civilian objects during international armed conflict), with Art. 8(2)(e) ICCSt. (lacking the same during non-international armed conflict).\n⁵⁴ See Roscini, supra note 33, at 271 (‘the Prosecutor might decide to select certain situations and cases involving the commission, instigation or facilitation of international crimes through cyber conduct because of their impact or to deter them in the future, even if they resulted in a lower number of victims than in other cases’); OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization, supra note 21, § 50(d) (listing under case prioritization criteria ‘the impact of investigations and prosecutions on ongoing criminality and/or their contribution to the prevention of crimes’).\n⁵⁵ M.E. Cross, ‘Strategising International Prosecutions: How Might the Work of the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor’s Office Come to Be Judged?’ 20 International Criminal Law Review (2020) 43, at 67–68 (emphasis in original).\n⁵⁶ Even when targeting a military adversary or objective, however, the means are not unlimited. See Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 188 (‘A long-standing IHL rule prohibits the employment of “weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”, citing Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977, Art. 35(2)).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 occurred. Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established,⁵⁷ in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable;⁵⁸ thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive⁵⁹ that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral)⁶⁰ even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt An additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.⁶¹ Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation,⁶² issuing a warrant,⁶³ and for confirmation of charges⁶⁴ — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a ⁵⁷ See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art. III (including ‘[c]onspiracy to commit genocide’, ‘[d]irect and public incitement to commit genocide’, and ‘[a]ttempt to commit genocide’). See J.D. Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n⁵⁸ The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n⁵⁹ See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n⁶⁰ Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n⁶¹ Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H. Dederer and T. Singer, ‘Adverse Cyber Operations: Causality, Attribution, Evidence, and Due Diligence’, 95 International Law Studies (2019) 430.\n⁶² Art. 15(4) ICCSt.\n⁶³ Art. 58(1)-(3) ICCSt.\n⁶⁴ Art. 61 ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1147 reasonable doubt. This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65] Attribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system JICJ (2021) 1133-1164 rather than immediately recognize they have been subjected to an 'attack'. The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72 ## C. Issues of Jurisdiction While questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75 Where many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149 that conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis.⁷⁶ The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.⁷⁷ There is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’.⁷⁸ The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’.⁷⁹ If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction.⁸⁰ As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment⁸¹ and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction.⁸² The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment⁸³ — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to ⁷⁶ Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 55-56, §§ 3-4 (Rule 9).\n⁷⁹ Ibid., § 2.\n⁸⁰ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n⁸¹ The Crime of Aggression, RC/Res.6*, Review Conference of the Rome Statute, adopted 11 June 2010, by consensus, available online at https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/docs/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸² Activation of the Jurisdiction of the Court Over the Crime of Aggression, ICC-ASP/16/Res.5, 14 December 2017 (‘Activating Resolution’), available online at https://asp.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/ASP16/ICC-ASP-16-Res5-ENG.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸³ There is an argument that the jurisdictional limitations, which arguably came about only in the Activating Resolution, were ineffective to modify the original jurisdictional agreement in the Kampala amendment. See Trahan, supra note 44.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 exist over the crime; that reading would severely restrict the crime's jurisdictional reach as, at the time of writing, only 41 states parties have ratified the Kampala crime of aggression amendment.⁸⁴ The possibility of referral by the UN Security Council also exists, covering all four crimes, and provides another route whereby jurisdiction may be created.⁸⁵ ## D. The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences Given that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets,⁸⁶ another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context).⁸⁷ The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁸ ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁹ While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’.⁹⁰ Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.⁹¹ ⁸⁴ United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch. XVIII, Penal Matters, ‘Amendments on the Crime of Aggression to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court’, as of 18 January 2021, available online at https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&amp;chapter=18⟨=en (visited 30 January 2021).\n⁸⁵ See Arts 13(b), 15ter ICCSt. For background on Security Council referrals and the crime of aggression, see J. Trahan, ‘Revisiting the Role of the Security Council Regarding the International Criminal Court’s Crime of Aggression’, 17 Journal of International Criminal Justice (2019) 471.\n⁸⁶ See supra note 7 (Ukraine).\n⁸⁷ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 343, §§ 13–14 (considering reasonably foreseeable consequences versus unexpected results).\n⁸⁸ Art. 30(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt.\n⁸⁹ Art. 30(3) ICCSt.\n⁹⁰ Case Matrix Network, Art. 30(2)(b), Intent in Relation to Result (Mohamed Elewa Badar and Sara Porro, authors) updated 18 August 2017.\n⁹¹ Ibid. (citing Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo Against His Conviction, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-A-5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 441 et seq; Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Bemba (ICC-01/05-01/08-424), Pre-Trial Chamber, 15 June 2009, § 359 et seq). Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151 If ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).⁹²) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach),⁹³ it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’.⁹⁴ ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.⁹⁵ ## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute A final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be ⁹² J. Trahan, *Genocide, War Crimes, and Crime Against Humanity: A Topical Digest of the Case Law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia* (Human Rights Watch, 2006), ch.

Compare Public Redacted Version of ‘Prosecution’s Response to the Defence Closing Brief’, 17 July 2018, ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Conf, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2306-Red), Trial Chamber VI, 7 November 2018, § 247; and Closing Arguments, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-T-264-Red2-ENG), Trial Chamber VI, 30 August 2018, at 49–51 (arguing that foresight of a criminal consequence ‘even if [its] commission is not certain’ may suffice); with Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 774, note 2348 (rejecting the Prosecutor’s argument and requiring ‘virtual certainty’).\n⁹⁵ An exception might be if a particular war crime on its face encompassed anticipated or foreseeable consequences — for example, if the principles of distinction or proportionality were violated.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 extended by analogy. In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'.⁹⁶ Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges.⁹⁷ Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes The next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n# A. Cyber-Operations as War Crimes under the Rome Statute As mentioned, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes as its starting point that a cyber-operation can constitute a use of force.⁹⁸ '[C]yber operations are properly ⁹⁶ Art. 22(2) ICCSt.\n⁹⁷ UK Government, 'Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century' (23 May 2018), available online at https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (visited 30 January 2021) ('One of the biggest challenges for international law is ensuring it keeps pace as the world changes'); R.C. Slye and B. Van Schaack, Essentials: International Criminal Law (Aspen Publishers, 2009), at 92 ('It is generally accepted at the international level that treaties are to be treated as living documents. In other words, they are to be interpreted in the context of the time in which they are being applied, and not as they would have been interpreted at the time of their drafting').\n⁹⁸ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 329 (Rule 68).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1153 characterized as a method of warfare when employed to harm or interfere with enemy forces, military objectives, the civilian population, or civilian objects.⁹⁹ The Tallinn Manuals further take the view that, in a state of armed conflict (whether international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict), all the rules of international humanitarian law apply in the cyber-domain.¹⁰⁰ The ICJ’s holding in the Nuclear Weapons case reinforces this as the court maintained that IHL applies to ‘all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons’.¹⁰¹ Cyber-operations may be employed during and in the context of an already existing armed conflict or they (either alone or in conjunction with conventional weapons) might, in theory, create the state of armed conflict.¹⁰² If cyber-operations are subject to IHL, then, for example, they may not target civilians¹⁰³ or be targeted indiscriminately¹⁰⁴ (both of which would violate the principle of distinction), and may not cause excessive ‘collateral damage’ (which would violate the principle of proportionality).¹⁰⁵ Tallinn 2.0 expressly acknowledges that, when such IHL rules are violated, ‘[c]yber operations may ⁹⁹ Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 218.\n¹⁰⁰ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 375 (Rule 80). But see supra note 26 (Tallinn not universally accepted).\n¹⁰¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports (1996) 226, § 86 (the law of armed conflict ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’).\n¹⁰² It is more difficult to image cyber-operations creating the armed conflict but if the attacks cause deaths and/or destruction similar to a physical/kinetic attack, one can more readily envision this.\n¹⁰³ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 422 (Rule 94: ‘The civilian population … shall not be the object of cyber attack’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(i) ICCSt. (war crime of directing attacks against the civilian population in international armed conflict); Art. 8(2)(e)(i) ICCSt. (same in non-international armed conflict). But see Hathaway et al., supra note 12, at 852 (applying the principle of distinction becomes complex because ‘much of cyberspace is dual use’, with ‘[n]inety-five percent of military communications us[ing] civilian networks at some stage’).\n¹⁰⁴ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 455 (Rule 105: ‘It is prohibited to employ means or methods of cyber warfare that are indiscriminate by nature. [This occurs] when they cannot be: (a) directed at a specific military objective, or (b) limited in their effects as required by the laws of armed conflict, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction’). But see infra note 122 and accompanying text (annex missing for Rome Statute crime prohibiting ‘inherently indiscriminate’ weapons).\n¹⁰⁵ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 470 (Rule 113: ‘A cyber attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited’); see also Art. 8(2)(b)(iv) ICCSt. (in international armed conflict, war crime of ‘intentionally launching at attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’). See further Rowe, supra note 13 (‘Exacerbating the dangers of collateral damage is the increasing similarity of the software on military and civilian computers’; ‘even if a military site is accurately targeted by a cyber-attack, its damage may spread to civilian sites through electronic mail, shared storage media, web sites, or shared network infrastructure’).\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 amount to war crimes and thus give rise to individual criminal responsibility under international law'.¹⁰⁶ Under the Rome Statute, ‘[the] Court [has] jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as a part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.’¹⁰⁷ Thus, there is no absolute requirement to prove a ‘plan or policy’, or that the crimes are ‘large-scale’, although such instances would ‘in particular’ be of relevance to the Court. Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict,¹⁰⁸ and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime,¹¹⁰ as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.¹¹¹ As to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’.¹¹² The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’.¹¹³ For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization.¹¹⁴ It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and ¹⁰⁶ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n¹⁰⁷ Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n¹⁰⁸ The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes (2011), Art 8(2)(a)(i) War Crime of Wilful Killing, Element 4, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021).\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid., Introduction to Art. 8, § (c). See also §§ (a)-(b) ('There is no requirement for a legal evaluation by the perpetrator as to the existence of an armed conflict or its character as international or non-international [and]... there is no requirement for awareness by the perpetrator of the facts that established the character of the conflict as international or non-international').\n¹¹⁰ The Rome Statute contains different lists of war crimes depending if committed during international armed conflict or non-international armed conflict. Compare Art. 8(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt, with Art. 8(2)(c), (e) ICCSt.\n¹¹¹ See supra Sections 3.B.-D.

(To meet the ‘intensity’ requirement the armed conflict must be ‘protracted’). See Art. 8(2)(f) ICCSt. (referencing ‘protracted armed conflict between... [organized armed groups]’). As to the ‘organization’ requirement, there must be an ability to plan and carry out sustained military operations. Decision on the Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1155 organizational requirements, such that cyber-operations alone may not always establish the existence of a non-international armed conflict.¹¹⁵ The cyber-attacks on Eastern Ukraine provide a possible example of war crimes conducted using, at least partly, cyber-operations. These attacks were ‘blended attacks’, perpetrated through cyber and physical/kinetic means. The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities.¹¹⁶ Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU.¹¹⁷ Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population,¹¹⁸ or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’.¹¹⁹ The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii).¹²⁰ Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.¹²¹ Confirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n¹¹⁵ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’). Cyber-operations could, however, still constitute war crimes if committed during a pre-existing non-international armed conflict.\n¹¹⁶ Greenberg, supra note 3; F. Bezhan, ‘Cyberattack On Ukrainian Power Grid Looks To Some Like An Apocalyptic First’, Radio Free Europe (5 January 2016), available online at https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-blackout-cyberattack-power-grid-apocalyptic-first/27469154.html (visited 30 January 2021).

Ukraine accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction through two Art. 12(3) declarations, the first accepting jurisdiction from 21 November 2013 to 22 February 2014, and the second, from 20 February onward. ICC Press Release, ‘ICC Prosecutor extends preliminary examination of the situation in Ukraine following second article 12(3) declaration,’ 29 The ICC cannot presently prosecute the war crime of use of ‘indiscriminate weapons’ (which only applies during international armed conflict). The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex.¹²² A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted.¹²³ States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n## B. Cyber-operations as Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute The hallmark requirements for crimes against humanity are acts ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’.¹²⁴ Article 7(2)(a) defines the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)] against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’.¹²⁵ The ‘attack’ needed to prove ‘crimes against humanity’ need not be a military attack; in fact, the hallmark of crimes against humanity is that the attack is directed against a civilian population and need not be linked to armed conflict.¹²⁶ There are also requirements that the perpetrator’s September 2015, available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1156 (visited 30 January 2021).\n¹²² For an explanation of why the Rome negotiations resulted in an annex requirement but no annex, see R.S. Clark, ‘Building on Article 8(2)(b)(xx) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: Weapons and Methods of Warfare’, 12 New Criminal Law Review (2009) 366.\n¹²³ See Protocol I, Art. 51(4)(a)–(c) (prohibition of indiscriminate attacks); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 467, § 1 (the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks is customary international law). See also Horowitz, supra note 53 (‘Setting loose a “worm”’ (a self-replicating or self-propagating computer program) that attacks anything it encounters with the hope that it eventually damages and adversary’s computer network would, for example, be prohibited as an indiscriminate attack under IHL’); Biller and Schmitt, supra note 52, at 187 (‘a destructive computer virus that was programmed to spread and destroy uncontrollably within civilian Internet systems would be prohibited as an inherently indiscriminate weapon’, quoting Office of the General Counsel, US Department of Defense, Law of War Manual, Section 16.1 (rev. edn., December 2016)).\n¹²⁴ Art. 7(1) ICCSt.\n¹²⁵ Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt.\n¹²⁶ See e.g. Judgment, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-2359), Trial Chamber VI, 8 July 2019, § 662 (‘An “attack” for the purpose of crimes against humanity is distinct from an “attack” referred to in Article 8 of the Statute for purpose of determining whether a war crime was committed. It may be, but need not be, part of a military operation’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1157 'conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population' and that '[t]he perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population'.[127] The 'underlying crimes' supporting a charge of crimes against humanity are murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape or sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid, and other inhumane acts.[128] Returning to the example of a cyber-operation that penetrates the operating system of several dams located above a major city, opening the dams' flood-gates such that a tidal wave of water floods a city directly downstream, and causing major loss of life — this could constitute the crime against humanity of murder if evidence proves that the attack[129] was 'widespread' or 'systematic';[130] and orchestrated through a 'State or organizational policy';[131] so that one can attribute responsibility to particular perpetrators, prove intent and knowledge, and satisfy jurisdiction.[132] The same cyber-operation, if it could be shown it was directed toward members of a particular protected group, could additionally constitute the crime against humanity of persecution.¹³³ Crimes against humanity also include a residual ‘catch-all’ — namely, ‘[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character [to other crimes against humanity] intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’.¹³⁴ Cyber-operations with severe enough consequences could potentially also fall within this category.¹³⁵ While there appears to be great interest in the vexing problem of cyber-operations disrupting elections — and this conduct could certainly be widespread or systematic — to this author, such interference does not rise to the level of ‘other inhumane acts’ because it would not involve ‘great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’. If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met.¹³⁶ Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).¹³⁷ ## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute In the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’.¹³⁸ As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group).¹³⁹ This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but ¹³³ Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n¹³⁴ Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n¹³⁵ It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n¹³⁶ See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n¹³⁷ See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n¹³⁸ Genocide Convention, Art. II; Art. 6 ICCSt.\n¹³⁹ Art. 6 ICCSt.; C. Kreß, ‘The Crime of Genocide under International Law’, 6 International Criminal Law Review (2006) 461, at 498 (‘The words “as such” express the idea of the targeting of the group through its members’).\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1159 may be inferred from the circumstances.¹⁴⁰ As to the requirement of ‘intent to destroy’, the ad hoc tribunals have required a showing of intent to inflict physical or biological destruction, and the destruction must be aimed at least at a ‘substantial part’ of the protected group.¹⁴¹ While genocide is an ‘inchoate’ crime — for example, incitement alone or attempt alone could be the completed crime¹⁴² — if no genocide occurs, as suggested above, the crimes might not satisfy the gravity requirement.¹⁴³ In addition to these overall contextual or chapeau requirements, there must be proof of the commission of at least one of the ‘underlying crimes’, with the first being the killing of members of the group.¹⁴⁴ The second underlying crime is ‘[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’¹⁴⁵ and the third ‘[d]eliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, for a cyber-operation to constitute the crime of genocide, proof would be needed of this overall special mental state requirement and of at least one of the underlying crimes.¹⁴⁷ Also — as with all Rome Statute crimes — there would need to be proof of attribution to particular individuals sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility, proof of intent and knowledge, and jurisdiction.\nIn the same way that ethnic groups have been targeted through physical/kinetic means (the Hutu targeting the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda,¹⁴⁸ the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militia targeting the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa in Darfur, and the military of the Republika Srpska (VRS) targeting the men and boys in and around Srebrenica), one can imagine that the targeting of protected groups might theoretically be perpetrated through a ¹⁴⁰ Trahan, supra note 92, at 155 (compiling ICTY cases). There is limited ICC jurisprudence on the crime of genocide.\n¹⁴¹ Ibid., at 148–150 (compiling ICTY cases on the requirement of physical or biological destruction), 158 (compiling ICTY cases on the ‘substantial part’ requirement).\n¹⁴² See supra note 57.\n¹⁴³ See supra note 58 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴⁴ Art. 6(a) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁵ Art. 6(b) ICCSt. Conduct only inflicting serious bodily or mental harm might not rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity absent accompanying physical or biological destruction (killing) of group members.\n¹⁴⁶ Art. 6(c) ICCSt. “[C]onditions of life” may include, but [are] not necessarily restricted to, deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival, such as food or medical services, or systematic expulsion from homes’. See ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(c) Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, note 4. The fourth underlying crime is ‘[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group’, and the fifth is ‘[f]orcibly transferring children of the group to another group’. Art. 6(d)–(e) ICCSt.\n¹⁴⁷ An exception might be the ‘inchoate’ forms of responsibility. See supra note 57. The ICC Elements of Crimes also require — at least for non-inchoate forms of responsibility — proof that ‘[t]he conduct took place in the context of a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group or was conduct that could itself effect such destruction’. See e.g. ICC Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Art. 6(a) Genocide by killing, Element 4.\n¹⁴⁸ For background on how the killing was incited by radio-broadcasts, see e.g. J.F. Metzi, ‘Rwandan Genocide and the International Law of Radio Jamming’, 91 American Journal of International Law (1997) 628.\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164 cyber-operation or a blended cyber and physical/kinetic attack. For example, one might imagine members of a protected group being identified or monitored through cyber technology,¹⁴⁹ or the use of cyber means to incite genocide, with the killing committed through physical/kinetic means.¹⁵⁰ (These might be examples of cyber-enabled genocide.¹⁵¹) One could also imagine a cyber-initiated nuclear meltdown that kills a large number of members of another national group (i.e. those in another state).¹⁵² ## D. Cyber-operations as the Crime of Aggression under the Rome Statute While the crime of aggression has numerous requirements and warrants a far more extensive discussion, it is crucial to establish, inter alia, a state's 'act of aggression'¹⁵³ constitutes a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter by its 'character, gravity and scale'.¹⁵⁴ The 'act of aggression' is defined as 'use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political ¹⁴⁹ One could imagine infiltrating people's genetic/medical information — collected by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or governments — for members of the genocidal group to use to identify and attack members of the protected group. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see also Roscini, supra note 33, at 251 (suggesting the example of a 'network intrusion to acquire the names of individuals registered as a certain race' as part of committing genocide, citing Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 66). Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction. Author conversation with Noah Weisbord, 13 August 2020; see e.g. C. Buckley and P. Mozur, 'How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities', N.Y.

Another shared a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man... The Facebook posts were not from everyday internet users. Instead, they were from Myanmar military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing, according to former military officials, researchers and civilian officials in the country.\n¹⁵¹ Probably for all Rome Statute crimes, the crime could be cyber-enabled — with cyber-operations playing a role, but not necessarily being the main or predominant means whereby the crime is committed. Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n¹⁵² See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n¹⁵³ Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n¹⁵⁴ Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.\nCyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1161 independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations'.155 Article 8bis(2) enumerates a list of acts that could meet this requirement,156 but each would additionally need to constitute a 'manifest' violation of the UN Charter.157 Another requirement is that the crime only covers 'leaders' in that it applies only to 'person[s] in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State'.158 Also, the leader would need to engage in the 'planning, preparation, initiation or execution' of the crime.159 Accordingly, considering a cyber-operation as a potential crime of aggression, this would only apply where: (1) jurisdiction exists; (2) there is a 'manifest' Charter violation — in other words, perhaps not just any Article 2(4) violation (an unlawful 'use of force') but probably something more like an 'armed attack' (and/or an attack that is 'super clear' in terms of its illegality);160 (3) the crime will generally only cover acts of a state, as there are several references in the text to armed force 'by a State' or 'by the armed forces of a State' — although it could potentially cover non-state actors if the leader 'initiates', 'plans', or 'prepares' the act of aggression by employing non-state actors (hacker groups) and the acts of the non-state actors are attributable to the state;161 (4) the suspect is a person who satisfies the 'leadership clause' JICJ (2021) 1133-1164 (probably one of a limited set of top military or political leaders and/or those at the apex of cyber command structures); (5) such leader can be proven to have played a role in planning, preparing, initiating, or executing the cyber-operation; and (6) attribution to the suspect, and their intent and knowledge, could otherwise be proven through admissible evidence that satisfies ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’.¹⁶² While the above requirements appear difficult to satisfy, the fourth act enumerated as potentially qualifying as an ‘act of aggression’ is ‘[a]n attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State’,¹⁶³ and Article 8bis(2)(b) refers to ‘the use of any weapon by a State against the territory of another State’.¹⁶⁴ The Tallinn Manual explains how and when a cyber-operation could qualify as an ‘armed attack’, and this could potentially satisfy that definition, particularly if the cyber-operation is committed by the armed forces of a state.¹⁶⁵ One would additionally need to attribute responsibility to a particular leader (or head of cyber command) ‘in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military actions of a State’, who planned, prepared, initiated, or played a role in the execution of the cyber-operation. Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state.¹⁶⁶ The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality.¹⁶⁷ Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations¹⁶⁸ — if they are valid¹⁶⁹ — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).¹⁷⁰ ¹⁶² See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n¹⁶³ Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n¹⁶⁴ Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n¹⁶⁵ See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n¹⁶⁶ See supra note 161 (attribution).\n¹⁶⁷ The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful. See supra note 32 and accompanying text (severity, immediacy, etc.).\n¹⁶⁸ See supra notes 80-84 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶⁹ See Trahan, supra note 44.\n¹⁷⁰ See Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision, supra note 75 and accompanying text. Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163 Again returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2).¹⁷¹ Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation,¹⁷² is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties.¹⁷³ Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n# 5. Conclusion This article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare¹⁷⁴ will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce the crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties.

Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC.

It explains when and how such a cyber-operation could fall within the ambit of the ICC's crimes — genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The article additionally acknowledges some limitations as to which cyber-operations would be encompassed, given the ICC's gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could meet the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding such limitations, increased awareness of the previously largely overlooked potential of the Rome Statute to cover certain cyber-operations could potentially contribute to deterring such crimes.\n\n* Clinical Professor, NYU Center for Global Affairs, USA.

    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1135\n\nthat are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.\n\n## 2. Background\n\nThe past decade or two has witnessed a significantly large number of cyber-operations in a variety of forms, including those aimed at data-theft (stealing corporate information), extortion, spreading of false information, manipulation of elections, breach of government computers in an effort to steal state secrets, as well as 'denial of service' attacks. Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe.³ To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack).⁴ Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss⁵ and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.⁶\n\nThe use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a 'blended attack'.⁷ Many of the\n\n3 This occurred with the infamous NotPetya attack. See A. Greenberg, 'The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History', Wired (22 August 2018), available online at https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/ (visited 30 January 2021).

Most experts believe it to have been perpetrated by the US and Israel. E. Nakashima and J.

Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers). A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety-critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities,⁸ hospitals,⁹ power grids,¹⁰ or a dam located upstream from a major city.¹¹ One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction.

    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1137\n\nIdeally, state actors will develop cyber-technology, including cyber-weapons, in a responsible way, with a view to adhering to the laws of war when such weapons are utilized, such that cyber-operations — which can be precisely targeted¹³ — are directed only at military objectives and never civilian populations nor civilian or other protected objects, nor used indiscriminately or in a way that results in disproportionate ‘collateral damage’. Yet, unfortunately, not all states are committed to adhering to the laws of war and this most likely is and will be true also in the cyber-domain. (Indeed, the temptation to ignore international law could be even greater in the cyber-domain, where it is sometimes additionally difficult to identify who has launched a cyber-operation.¹⁴) Furthermore, even states generally committed to complying with the laws of war rarely achieve complete compliance, as law appears particularly susceptible to violation during a state of armed conflict. Cyber-operations can also inadvertently proliferate beyond their intended target¹⁵ and the software code used in cyber-operations may be ‘repurposed’ by others.¹⁶ Concerns multiply when one considers the possibility of cyber-operations being perpetrated by (or of software used in cyber operations repurposed by) non-state actors (e.g. cyber-criminals/transnational criminal groups, terrorist organizations, loosely affiliated bands of hackers, or even isolated individuals). Such non-state actors could also be operating at the instigation or behest of a state.¹⁷ Cyberwarfare may in some ways ‘level the playing field’ insofar as not only powerful militaries can launch potentially destructive cyber-operations, but this is a double-edged sword. A cyber-operation could in theory be launched from one lone computer or a network of computers, making even lone hackers potentially powerful adversaries.¹⁸\n\nUighurs may also be cyber-enabled, see infra note 149, but the ICC also lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in China, a non-state party.\n\n¹³ See e.g. S.M. Bellovin, S. Landau, and H.S. Lin, ‘Limiting the Undesired Impact of Cyber Weapons: Technical Requirements and Policy Implications’, 3 Journal of Cybersecurity (2017) 59; N.C.

(difficulties of attribution).\n\n¹⁵ This occurred with the NotPetya attack.\n\n¹⁶ States can design cyber-weapons to reduce proliferation risks and to reduce the ability of others to ‘repurpose’ cyber-weapons: Bellovin et al., supra note 13, at 60.\n\n¹⁷ See e.g. J. Taylor, ‘Chinese Cyberhackers “Blurring Line Between State Power and Crime”’, The Guardian (7 August 2019), available online at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/chinese-cyberhackers-blurring-line-between-state-power-and (visited 30 January 2021) (discussing a group of state-sponsored hackers in China).\n\n¹⁸ See K.

    "1138\nJICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n\nThis article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC's Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations. While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors. Specifically, Part 3 below considers five initial overarching considerations relevant to all Rome Statute crimes: (1) which cyber-operations might meet the Rome Statute's 'gravity' threshold; (2) the need to prove attribution through admissible evidence that could satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) questions of jurisdiction; (4) the Rome Statute's 'intent' requirement; and (5) the prohibition on expanding the definition of crimes by analogy. Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute's substantive crimes.¹⁹\n\n## 3. Overarching Considerations\n\n### A. Which Cyber-operations Would Satisfy the ICC's Gravity Threshold?\n\nAn initial key area for consideration is what kinds of cyber-operations could satisfy the gravity threshold of the Rome Statute. In order to be 'admissible', Article 17 of the Rome Statute requires that a case must be of 'sufficient gravity to justify ... action by the Court'.²⁰ Additionally, Article 53 states that the Prosecutor may only initiate an investigation or proceed with a case if that case 'would be admissible under Article 17'.²¹\n\nA recent Appeals Chamber decision explains the gravity requirement:\n\n[T]he gravity requirement ... aims at excluding those rather unusual cases where the specific facts of a given case technically qualify as crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court, but are nonetheless not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. ... '[T]he purpose of article 17(1)(d) of the Statute is not to oblige the Court to choose only the most serious cases, but merely to oblige it not to prosecute cases of marginal gravity'. ...\n\n[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber ... held that when determining whether the gravity requirement ... is fulfilled, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are relevant considerations. It\n\n¹⁹ This article does not analyze issues related to individual criminal responsibility or superior responsibility. For a discussion of superior responsibility for cyber-attacks, see E. van Sliedregt, 'Command Responsibility and Cyberattacks', 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 505.\n\n²⁰ Art. 17(1)(d) ICCSt.\n\n²¹ Art. 53(1)(b) ICCSt.; see also Art. 53(2)(b) ICCSt. There are actually two gravity assessments: (1) gravity in evaluating the 'admissibility' of a situation, and (2) gravity in case selection. See OTP Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritization (15 September 2016), available online at https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf (visited 30 January 2021), §§ 32 (gravity as a criterion for admissibility), 35–41 (gravity for case selection).",
    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1139\n\nfurther noted that some factors ... could provide relevant guidance to the assessment of gravity ... including the extent of the damage caused, the nature of the unlawful behaviour, the means employed to execute the crime, the degree of participation of the accused person, the degree of intent, the circumstances of manner, time and location, the existence of particularly defenceless victims, the commission of crimes with particular cruelty or where there are multiple victims, and the commission of crimes for any motive involving discrimination. ... [T]he Appeals Chamber agrees with this approach.²²\n\nGiven the multitude of cyber-crimes that would not reach the Rome Statute's gravity threshold, and the significant number of cyber-operations that also might not do so, it becomes important to analyse which cyber-operations could reach that threshold. A useful starting point is found in the work of a group of independent experts who, convened at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia, produced two manuals. The first, referred to as 'Tallinn 1.0', addresses international law applicable to cyber-warfare.²³ The second, convened by a more diverse group of experts and referred to as 'Tallinn 2.0',²⁴ addresses cyber-operations more broadly, both during and outside armed conflict.²⁵ The Tallinn Manuals are extremely important in making clear that international law (including IHL, international human rights law, and jus ad bellum) applies in the area of cyber-operations. While recognizing this position is nonetheless still disputed, particularly by certain states,²⁶ the author will proceed\n\n²² Judgment on the appeal of Mr Al Hassan against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled 'Décision relative à l'exception d'irrecevabilité pour insuffisance de gravité de l'affaire soulevée par la défense', Al Hassan (ICC-01/12-01/18-601-Red OA), Appeals Chamber, 19 February 2020, §§ 59, 89–90 (internal notes omitted).

Although the Manuals are not binding law on the ICC (nor elsewhere), and states and experts hold divergent views on the weight to accord to them,²⁷ at minimum, they provide a useful starting point for analysis.²⁸\n\nWhile the Tallinn experts opined on international law more broadly (addressing neither the ICC nor its gravity threshold), one topic they discussed was when a cyber-operation would qualify as a ‘use of force’. (That language is of course significant in analysing when Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is violated.²⁹) Specifically, they opined that a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ when it has ‘scale and effects’ similar to a physical/kinetic attack.³⁰ Thus, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 takes the position that ‘acts that injure or kill persons or physically damage or destroy objects’ would amount to ‘uses of force’.³¹ The experts additionally suggested various criteria that ‘States are likely to consider’ as to when a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’, including: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, and measurability of effects.³² While admittedly formulated for a different purpose, this definition is nonetheless helpful for considering which cyber-operations might reach the ICC’s gravity threshold and these criteria appear useful ones for the ICC Prosecutor to consider in making the assessment.

    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1141\n\nIt is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC's gravity threshold. For example, in the ICC's Comoros situation, where 10 fatalities resulted from Israeli Defense Forces firing on a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) took the position that the fatalities did not reach the ICC's gravity threshold.³⁴ On the other hand, the OTP did proceed in the Abu Garda case regarding the killing of 12 peacekeepers 'because of the significance of the target and impact on peacekeeping operations'.³⁵ Reading these cases together cannot furnish a conclusion on the number of fatalities needed to reach the gravity threshold, as there are clearly additional factors that go into the analysis. Note that when the ICC Prosecutor considered the impact on peacekeeping operations as part of the gravity analysis in the Abu Garda case, she opened the door to considering, as part of the gravity analysis, the importance of pursuing a cyber-operations case — both to demonstrate the ability of the ICC to pursue such cases and potentially to increase the possibility of deterrence against future malicious cyber-operations.³⁶ Likewise, a moderate amount of physical damage or destruction of objects may not meet the gravity threshold, although an exception might arise if a specially protected object were targeted.³⁷ Thus, the Tallinn Manual's definition of a cyber 'use of force' might not align perfectly with the ICC's potential approach for defining\n\nFacilitates International Crimes’, 30 Criminal Law Forum (2019) 247 (considering how the gravity criteria of scale, nature, manner of commission, and impact would be evaluated regarding cyber-operations).\n\n³⁴ The Prosecutor ‘concluded that, in the absence of a potential case of sufficient gravity arising from the situation, there is no reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation’.

(That language is of course significant as a cyber ‘armed attack’ may trigger the right to individual or collective-self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter³⁸ — self-defence that presumably could be conducted through cyber-operations, physical/kinetic operations, or both.) Specifically, the Tallinn experts relied on the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case that an ‘armed attack’ is a ‘particularly serious’ form of the ‘use of force’.³⁹ They concluded that ‘a cyber operation that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes significant damage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement’ and thus constitute an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁰ This provides a definition that might better approximate what the ICC’s gravity threshold should be when considering cyber-operations.⁴¹\n\nAt the same time, it is useful to consider whether one should fully close the door to cyber-operations that do not satisfy the Tallinn Manual’s definitions (of either ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’) from reaching the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold.⁴² For instance, France has suggested that operations that penetrate military systems to weaken French defensive capabilities, even if this does not produce physical effects, would constitute a ‘use of force’.⁴³ While France is not taking the view that such conduct would constitute a Rome Statute crime, it is worth considering whether it would reach Rome Statute gravity (assuming the elements of a Rome Statute crime could be demonstrated). On balance, such an attack probably should not be considered as rising to the level of gravity of the Rome Statute, nor indeed should any other penetration of\n\n³⁸ Art. 51 UN Charter; Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71: ‘A State that is a target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense’).\n\n³⁹ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 332, § 6 (a ‘most grave’ use of force constitutes an ‘armed attack’), citing Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v U.S.), Merits, Judgment ICJ Reports (1986) 14, § 191 (hereinafter ‘Nicaragua case’).

Here, one might again differentiate between a catastrophic systems attack that directly results in serious loss of life (which the author proposes could potentially meet the ICC’s gravity threshold), versus one that may cripple a stock market or banking system but does not directly cause serious loss of life or harm to persons, and therefore probably should not be considered as meeting the gravity threshold.⁴⁶\n\nThese are actually profound questions: is loss of life or serious physical destruction always the most grave of harms?

The Tallinn Manual has been heavily criticized for omitting denial of service (DDoS) attacks and destruction of data under the purview of 'use of force';[47] yet, even if they were considered 'use of force', that still would not answer the question whether they should rise to the level of Rome Statute gravity. What about deaths that only remotely ensue but are connected by the chain of causation? What about causing a global shipping conglomerate and a number of other companies around the world to lose or need to shut down all IT functions in a massive malware attack that causes extensive economic loss?[48] What if this happened in conjunction with the destruction of terabytes of data of governmental organizations and companies, from media outlets to railway firms, followed by widespread power outages?[49]\n\nThese questions will require far more extensive consideration. The ICC's cases, to date, have focused on more 'traditional' areas.[50] Possibly, in the future, the OTP might want to consider issuing a policy paper on gravity and cyber-operations, or on cyber-operations and the Rome Statute. For present purposes, the author will suggest that it may be a helpful start to adopt the Tallinn Manual's definition of an 'armed attack' as a starting point for when a cyber-operation could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold.[51] That is, a cyber-operation that causes serious injuries or loss of life and/or significant physical damage or destruction is one that could satisfy the Rome Statute's gravity threshold. Another area that will require further consideration is whether destruction of data should be included.[52] This author has suggested a more conservative approach in that only physical damage or\n\n47 See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3.\n48 The author refers to the NotPetya attack that spread to Maersk and other companies around the world. See Greenberg, supra note 3. But see Section 3.D infra (the ICC's intent requirement likely excludes responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limits responsibility even for foreseen consequences).\n49 This also occurred during the NotPetya attack which took place in conjunction with offensive military operations by Russian forces into Ukraine. Greenberg, supra note 3.\n50 For example, Bemba focused on command responsibility for mass rape, murder, and pillage, charged as crimes against humanity and war crimes; Lubanga focused on the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate in hostilities; and al Mahdi resulted in a guilty plea to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion. Although the charges in the last two cases were seen as somewhat ground-breaking when brought, admittedly, the cyber-domain would represent even more novel territory.\n51 Another reason to read ICC 'gravity' as requiring a fairly high threshold is that one would not want any confusion that it lowers the threshold for what constitutes an 'armed attack' in the cyber-realm, which could carry significant consequences as an 'armed attack' permits the exercise of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 339 (Rule 71).\n52 There is controversy whether data should be considered an 'object' under IHL. See J.T. Biller and M.N.

This ‘expressivist’ approach — pursuing prosecutions that further protected values and thereby sending a message to achieve a given result⁵⁴ — is indeed an important and legitimate aspect of prosecutorial strategy. For example, Matthew Cross writes:\n\nIncreasing attention is generally being paid to the ‘expressivist’ function of international criminal law, which places emphasis on the significance of criminal prosecution and punishment as symbolising the legal and moral condemnation of the constituents of international criminal law (the international community, victims, etc). On this view, while most international or hybrid tribunals may not be in a position to deliver the ‘quantity’ of justice required for purposes such as retribution or deterrence, they can provide ‘quality’ justice which assists local and global communities in: establishing that certain forms of conduct actually take place; stigmatising that conduct; identifying the norms which proscribe that conduct; and so on.⁵⁵\n\nGravity considerations, however, provide only the initial starting point for analysis. For example, in analyzing war crimes, if there is a cyber-operation during armed conflict (either international or non-international) that also caused serious loss of life of armed combatants or destruction of military targets, these generally would not constitute Rome Statute crimes,⁵⁶ so would not be relevant to the gravity analysis even if a war crime appeared otherwise to have\n\n⁵³ See e.g. K.

Alternatively, a cyber-operation (or a physical/kinetic attack) by itself may not necessarily trigger a state of ‘armed conflict’, so then one would not meet the contextual requirement for war crimes at all. Similarly, while a limited number of fatalities, or even no fatalities, could theoretically constitute the crime of genocide if the special mental state requirement of genocide (dolus specialis) were established,⁵⁷ in the situations of genocide that have been prosecuted to date before international criminal tribunals the number of fatalities has been considerable;⁵⁸ thus, charging genocide absent significant fatalities could prove a risky prosecutorial strategy. As to crimes against humanity, if a single target is involved, with a limited number of victims, one may not have an attack that is ‘widespread’ or ‘systematic.’ Furthermore, as to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive⁵⁹ that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral)⁶⁰ even if the ‘gravity’ threshold were met.\n\n## B. Proving Attribution through Admissible Evidence that Establishes Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\n\nAn additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.⁶¹ Lower standards apply at the ICC for opening an investigation,⁶² issuing a warrant,⁶³ and for confirmation of charges⁶⁴ — but those standards would not apply at trial, where ultimately proof is required beyond a\n\n⁵⁷ See Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 9 December 1948, 78 UNTS 277, Art.

Ohlin, ‘Attempt, Conspiracy, and Incitement to Commit Genocide’, Cornell Law Faculty Publications, Paper 24 (2009) (inchoate offenses).\n\n⁵⁸ The crimes in 1994 in Rwanda were adjudicated in multiple decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to constitute genocide, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has likewise held in numerous decisions that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide. The Iraqi High Tribunal (while not an international tribunal) held that the crimes committed during the 1988 Iraqi ‘Anfal campaign’ against the Iraqi Kurds constituted genocide. See J. Trahan, ‘A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s Anfal Judgment: Genocide against the Kurds’, 30 Michigan Journal of International Law (2009) 305. The suspected genocides in Darfur, Myanmar, and of the Yazidis and Uighurshave not yet been adjudicated. The ICTY to date has also rejected the theory that genocide occurred in the ‘municipalities’ — locations in Bosnia aside from Srebrenica. See e.g. Judgment, Karadžić (IT-95-5/18-T), Trial Chamber, 24 March 2016 (acquittal on charges related to genocide in the municipalities).\n\n⁵⁹ See infra notes 80–84 and accompanying text.\n\n⁶⁰ Art. 15ter ICCSt.\n\n⁶¹ Art. 66(3) ICCSt. For discussion of attribution, see e.g. H.

This includes the issue of attribution (who conducted the cyber-operation), tracking it back not just to a state (or non-state actor/hacker group working for the state), but potentially to a particular ‘computer … to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real mastermind’ behind the attack.[65]\n\nAttribution may be a challenge for all crimes, but particularly so for conduct in cyberspace. Not only do cyber-attackers sometimes go to considerable lengths to conceal cyber-operations,[66] states have at times deliberately hidden their cyber-operations as perpetrated by another state ('false-flagging'). This, for example, happened when 'Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation', thereby reportedly hacking into 'government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic [of Iran].[67] Or states can hide behind non-state actors to mask their operations.[68] Even when that is not the case, cyber-operations can be difficult to attribute because they can be perpetrated through a single computer or network of computers located far from where the consequences impact, and also can be concealed by feigning that operating systems are functioning normally.[69] Furthermore, if attribution is to be made, this raises questions as to who would be in a position to do so. Will it be practical for the ICC to do this by itself? And, if not, what are the implications of relying on state cooperation in this regard?\n\nFor Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence[70] and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex. There would need to be evidence gathering[71] (on both the IT and operational technology (OT) sides), chain of custody would need to be established, and, furthermore, the victim might believe the issue is just a glitch in the system\n\n65 N.

The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process. This knowledge could be internally developed through hiring and/or the use of outside experts; yet, all of this might be very difficult to organize without excellent state cooperation. The more that cyber investigatory capacities of the ICC increase, the more important will it be for the court to have in place protections safeguarding privacy and related digital rights; the ICC will thus need (and probably should already have) a privacy policy and data protection standards that are binding on the institution.72\n\n## C. Issues of Jurisdiction\n\nWhile questions of jurisdiction merit a far more extensive analysis, it is worth initially observing that a cyber-operation may often be launched from one state (the 'attacker' state), where the operations originated, with consequences (or 'effects')73 felt in one or more (even many) 'victim' states. Absent a Security Council referral, either the 'attacker' state or 'victim' state would need to be a state party to the Rome Statute, or the perpetrators would need to be nationals of a state party — because the Rome Statute gives the ICC jurisdiction over the nationals of, and crimes committed on the territory of, states parties.74 In this latter regard, the Pre-Trial Chamber's ruling in the Myanmar/Bangladesh situation holds that at least one element of the crime must have been committed on the territory of a state party for ICC jurisdiction to exist.75\n\nWhere many states are impacted, the question arises whether even a modest amount of impact (effects) in one ICC state party would suffice to give the ICC jurisdiction, or whether some kind of threshold must be satisfied — and, if so, whether this threshold may be satisfied collectively if multiple states are affected, and whether they would all have to be ICC states parties? For example, if the attack produces consequences in ten states but only one is an ICC state party, would that suffice to create jurisdiction if the effects in the one state party do not independently satisfy the threshold but the effects in the ten states would do so? The preliminary answer from the ICC appears to be in the affirmative. In the Comoros situation, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed its view\n\n72 See A. Lubin, 'Politics, Power Dynamics, and the Limits of Existing Self-Regulation and Oversight in ICC Preliminary Examinations' (making this suggestion), in M. Bergsmo and C. Stahn (eds), Quality Control in Preliminary Examination: Vol. 2 (Torkel Opsahl Academic EPublisher, 2018) 78, 141–143.\n\n73 There is an entire body of jurisdiction based on the 'effects' test. See e.g. The S.S. 'Lotus' (France v. Turkey), P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 10, p. 4 (1927). However, for the ICC's purposes, the more salient inquiry appears to be whether one element of the crime occurred on the territory of a state party (objective territoriality). See infra note 75.\n\n74 See Art. 12(2)(a)-(b) ICCSt. See also Art. 12(3) ICCSt.\n\n75 Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the People's Republic of Bangladesh/Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Situation in Bangladesh/Myanmar (ICC-01/19-27), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 1 November 2019 ('Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision'), § 61.",
    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1149\n\nthat conduct occurring outside the jurisdictional reach of the Court may be taken into account for the purpose of gravity analysis.⁷⁶ The OTP agrees with this and has proposed the test that such extra-jurisdictional conduct must be ‘rationally and adequately’ linked to the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court in order to be taken into account.⁷⁷\n\nThere is also the question of the transit of an attack through the servers of a third state party or multiple third states parties (also referred to as the ‘routing state(s)’). The Tallinn experts (while opining on jurisdiction more generally and not ICC jurisdiction) suggested that in such a situation there would be only a ‘minimal connection with cyber infrastructure on that state’s territory’.⁷⁸ The Tallinn experts differentiated a situation where cyber infrastructure in the third state is taken over, which they conclude could create jurisdiction because the ‘use of such compromised cyber infrastructure [would not be] de minimis’.⁷⁹ If the ICC were to take an analogous approach, use of cyber infrastructure in a third state that is an ICC state party potentially could create ICC jurisdiction, although mere transit through the servers of a third state party might not do so.\n\nThe crime of aggression has a different and more complex jurisdictional regime. Crimes committed by non-state party nationals or on the territory of a non-state party are completely excluded from ICC jurisdiction.⁸⁰ As to states parties, it depends on how one reads the Kampala amendment⁸¹ and the Activating Resolution that activated crime of aggression jurisdiction.⁸² The Activating Resolution — which takes an extremely restrictive position that arguably conflicts with the Kampala crime of aggression amendment⁸³ — suggests that both the ‘victim’ and ‘aggressor’ states need to be states parties that have ratified the crime of aggression amendment for ICC jurisdiction to\n\n⁷⁶ Decision on the Request of the Union of the Comoros to Review the Prosecutor’s Decision not to Initiate an Investigation, Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros et al.

The ‘Intent’ Requirement and Unintended Consequences\n\nGiven that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets,⁸⁶ another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results; here, one might consider both (1) unintended and foreseeable consequences, and (2) unintended and unforeseeable consequences. These issues were considered by the Tallinn experts in terms of responsibility more generally (not in the Rome Statute context).⁸⁷ The Rome Statute appears to take a fairly restrictive approach with its requirements of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ in Article 30. Article 30(2) specifies that ‘intent’ exists when (1) a ‘person means to engage in the conduct’ or (2) ‘is aware that [the consequences] will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁸ ‘Knowledge’ is defined as awareness that a ‘circumstance exists’ or ‘a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events’.⁸⁹ While there is some support for including notions such as conscious risk-taking or recklessness, the ‘leading view in the early practice of the ICC’ takes a ‘restrictive interpretation’.⁹⁰ Thus, ‘[t]he Lubanga appeal judgment confirmed the interpretation put forward in the Bemba decision on the confirmation of charges, that under Article 30 … “the standard for the foreseeability of events is virtual certainty”’.⁹¹\n\n⁸⁴ United Nations Treaty Collection, Ch.

Other cases also endorse this ‘virtual certainty’ standard: see Judgment, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-3121-Red A5), Appeals Chamber, 1 December 2014, § 447; Judgment Pursuant to Article 74 of the Statute, Katanga (ICC-01/04-01/07-3436), Trial Chamber II, 7 March 2014, §§ 776–777.",
    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1151\n\nIf ICC jurisprudence remains consistent with that approach, responsibility would not attach to unforeseeable consequences, and even as to foreseeable consequences, the threshold would be quite high — ‘virtual certainty’ that the consequences will result. For example, imagine a dam above a city is penetrated and water released flooding a city below the dam. Under the Lubanga/Bemba standard, responsibility would only attach for flooding the city if there were ‘virtual certainty’ of that consequence. (By contrast, the ad hoc tribunals found there was responsibility for ‘reasonably foreseeable’ crimes when applying ‘joint criminal enterprise’ (type 3).⁹²) While a strong argument can be made that recklessness should sometimes rise to the level of intent (and some older ICC Pre-Trial decisions take that approach),⁹³ it does not seem to be the ICC’s primary approach, nor does the ICC appear to adopt the standard of ‘reasonable foreseeability’.⁹⁴ ‘Intentional endangerment’ arguably should, however, create individual criminal responsibility and the ICC’s states parties might consider a Rome Statute amendment to expressly encompass it as satisfying the intent requirement. Note also that domestic courts, as mentioned, as well as other international or hybrid tribunals are not limited by the Rome Statute’s standards — so the Rome Statute’s failure to encompass ‘recklessness’ does not mean that it is displaced in international criminal law more generally. Thus, the requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring ‘virtual certainty’ of the consequences.⁹⁵\n\n## E. The Impermissibility of Analogies under the Rome Statute\n\nA final limiting factor to consider is that Article 22(2) of the Rome Statute states: ‘[t]he definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be\n\n⁹² J.

In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted'.⁹⁶ Thus, one would either need to 'fit' the cyber-operation in question into the Statute's existing structure or not. Arguing about the similarities between a physical/kinetic attack and a cyber-operation, for example, may not suffice, because it would be suggesting application by analogy. This limitation and the presumption that ambiguity favours the defendant, however, does not mean that one could not give an updated, modern reading to Rome Statute provisions. Law, to serve a useful purpose, should meet contemporary challenges.⁹⁷ Furthermore, the Rome Statute is generally 'weapons neutral' or 'technology neutral' — one applies the crimes regardless of the particular weapon or technology utilized; viewed in this light, cyber is simply akin to a new weapon or technology system.\n\nThus, the above discussion suggests the potentially applicability of the Rome Statute to a limited subset of cyber-operations (1) if they meet the Rome Statute's gravity threshold; (2) where attribution could be proven, eventually, beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) where jurisdiction exists; (4) where 'intent' can be demonstrated (which appears to exclude responsibility for unforeseen consequences and limit responsibility even for foreseen consequences); and (5) where the harm caused falls within the definition of a Rome Statute crime without drawing upon analogies, with ambiguity construed to favour the defence.\n\n# 4. Consideration of the Rome Statute's Substantive Crimes\n\nThe next section briefly overviews how the Rome Statute's four crimes might apply to certain cyber-operations, and outlines the key elements of each. The author does not suggest this is a comprehensive discussion; rather, this overview clarifies that at least a limited subset of cyber-operations could fall within the ambit of the Rome Statute's crimes.\n\n# A.

Additionally, for a war crimes case, all the contextual elements would need to be proven — such as the existence of an ‘armed conflict’ (whether international or non-international), a ‘nexus’ between the cyber-operation and the armed conflict,¹⁰⁸ and the awareness of the perpetrator of the factual circumstances that established the existence of the armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ There would also be a need to prove the elements of the specific underlying war crime,¹¹⁰ as well as the need to prove attribution (linking a specific perpetrator sufficient to satisfy individual or superior responsibility), the need to establish intent and knowledge, and the need to satisfy jurisdiction.¹¹¹\n\nAs to the armed conflict requirement, under the generally accepted definition from the Tadić case, ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State’.¹¹² The Rome Statute (and IHL) particularly exclude ‘situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature’.¹¹³ For non-international armed conflict, the operations must have reached a minimum level of intensity and a non-state armed group must have achieved a certain level of organization.¹¹⁴ It could be difficult for non-state hacker groups to satisfy these intensity and\n\n¹⁰⁶ Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 391 (Rule 84).\n¹⁰⁷ Art. 8(1) ICCSt.\n¹⁰⁸ The Elements of Crimes specify that the conduct must have taken place ‘in the context of and was associated with an international [or non-international] armed conflict’.

The armed conflict there has killed more than 10,000 people, and, in addition to conventional military bombardments, included hacking into dozens of governmental organizations and companies through a ‘scorched-earth’ cyber-attack that affected victims ranging from media outlets, to railway firms and hospitals, causing hundreds of thousands of homes to lose electricity and shutting down at least three regional utilities.¹¹⁶ Both the United States and the UK take the view that the cyber-attacks on Ukraine were perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence service, commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU.¹¹⁷ Such cyber-operations conducted during a state of armed conflict could, if all the elements of the crimes were proven, potentially constitute the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population,¹¹⁸ or launching a disproportionate attack, wherein incidental loss of life or injury to civilians is ‘clearly excessive in relationship to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated’.¹¹⁹ The cyber-operations also appear to have been ‘indiscriminate’. A cyber-operation against a medical facility could also constitute a war crime under Rome Statute Articles 8(2)(b)(xxiv) or (e)(ii).¹²⁰ Of course, one would need to be able to attribute responsibility to particular individuals for an ICC case to proceed and this could prove difficult.¹²¹\n\nConfirmation of Charges, Lubanga (ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 29 January 2007, § 233.\n\n¹¹⁵ See Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 385 (‘given the threshold of violence and the degree of organization of the armed groups that is required for a non-international armed conflict … cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to a non-international armed conflict’).

The Rome Statute lists the use of indiscriminate weapons as a war crime in Article 8(2)(b)(xx), but states that this applies only to weapons ‘included in an annex to this Statute’; yet, there is no annex.¹²² A cyber-operation could be used in an indiscriminate fashion, or, to the extent that a cyber-weapon has the capability to self-replicate and mutate, it might be argued that (like a biological weapon) it has become ‘inherently indiscriminate’ such that it is incapable of being targeted.¹²³ States parties should either amend the Rome Statute to create the required annex or delete the requirement of having an annex; they should additionally amend the Rome Statute to include the war crime (with a completed annex or no annex requirement) if committed during non-international armed conflict.\n\n## B.

See Corrigendum to 'Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of the Côte d'Ivoire', Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (ICC-02/11-14-Corr), Pre-Trial Chamber III, 5 November 2011, § 29.\n128 For the precise terminology, see Art. 7(1)(a)-(k) ICCSt.\n129 There is also the requirement of proof of a nexus between the underlying crime(s) and the attack, but in this scenario the murders result directly from the cyber-operation opening the dams; thus, the nexus appears met.\n130 In the facts suggested, the ramifications could be considered 'widespread' if there are a large number of victims; that there were several attacks on the dams could alternatively be considered 'systematic'. One would only require proof of one. See Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Bosco Ntaganda, Ntaganda (ICC-01/04-02/06-309), Pre-Trial Chamber II, 9 June 2014, § 24 (finding an attack 'widespread' considering the 'large number of civilian victims', the 'broad geographical area' involved, and the duration of the attack); Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, Al Bashir (ICC-02/05-01/09-3), Pre-Trial Chamber I, 4 March 2009, § 81 ('[t]he term, \"systematic\" pertains to the organized nature of the acts of violence and to the improbability of their random occurrence').\n131 As to the 'policy', proof may be inferred from a variety of factors, such as whether (i) the attack was planned, directed or organized; (ii) a recurring pattern of violence; (iii) the use of public or private resources to further the policy; (iv) involvement of the State or organizational forces in the commission of crimes; (v) statements, instructions or documentation attributable to the State or the organization condoning or encouraging the commission of crimes; and/or (vi) an underlying motivation'.

Because the 'attack' could also constitute an 'armed attack', it is possible these facts could alternatively be analyzed as a war crime, particularly if the penetration of the dams trigger 'armed conflict' and there are different states involved. The same facts also could constitute the 'crime of aggression' if a number of additional elements are met. See infra Section 4.D.",

If one does not have an ‘underlying crime’, then the ‘attack’ requirement cannot be met.¹³⁶ Of course, this is not to say that there should be no consequences for election interference, which might violate other criminal laws (or be made to do so).¹³⁷\n\n## C. Cyber-operations as Genocide under the Rome Statute\n\nIn the same way that a cyber-operation that targets persons in particular protected groups could constitute the crime against humanity of persecution, genocide is a crime that targets members of a distinct ‘national, ethnical, racial or religious group’.¹³⁸ As to the crime of genocide, it is not the attack itself, but the intent behind the attack that is the crux of the crime. Thus, for the *dolus specialis* (special mental state requirement) of genocide to be satisfied, there must be proof of: (1) ‘intent to destroy’, (2) ‘in whole or in part’, (3) a ‘national ethnical, racial or religious group’, (4) ‘as such’ (i.e. because individuals belong to such a group).¹³⁹ This special mental state requirement, at least under the law of the ad hoc tribunals, need not be proven directly, but\n\n¹³³ Art. 7(1)(h) ICCSt. (referring to ‘any identifiable group or collectivity’ targeted on ‘political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender … or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law’).\n\n¹³⁴ Art. 7(1)(k) ICCSt.\n\n¹³⁵ It is unclear if the mental harm resulting from the consequences of a cyber-operation could rise to the level of torture, although the definition of torture does refer to ‘severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental’. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 1465 UNTS 85, Art. 1 (emphasis added). ‘Other inhumane acts’ also encompass acts ‘causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health’ (emphasis added) — thus also including mental impact.\n\n¹³⁶ See Art. 7(2)(a) ICCSt. (defining the ‘attack’ against the civilian population as ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts [enumerated in Article 7(1)]’).\n\n¹³⁷ See also *infra* notes 171–173 (considering election interference in terms of the crime of aggression).\n\n¹³⁸ Genocide Convention, Art.

Or one could imagine using facial recognition and other biometric data to track members of the protected group — as is already happening with the Uighurs in China — and group members then targeted for physical destruction.

Given this, and the extensive number of cyber-operations occurring, the need for the ICC to develop expertise regarding cyber and to consider issues such as establishing admissibility appears all the more urgent.\n\n¹⁵² See Roscini, supra note 33, at 250 (providing the example of a cyber-attack that shuts down the cooling system of a nuclear power reactor releasing high levels of radiation and killing members of a particular national group, if one could prove genocidal intent; also suggesting these facts could constitute a crime against humanity).\n\n¹⁵³ Art. 8bis(2) ICCSt.\n\n¹⁵⁴ Art. 8bis(1) ICCSt.",

ICC, Elements of Crimes, supra note 108, Article 8bis Crime of aggression, Element 6. But '[t]here is no requirement to prove that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to whether the use of armed force was inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations', nor 'that the perpetrator has made a legal evaluation as to the manifest' nature of the violation of the Charter of the United Nations'.

In determining attribution for the purpose of state responsibility, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case looked to whether 'effective control' existed. Nicaragua case, supra note 39, § 115. See also International Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries (adopted), UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), Arts 5, 8, 9, 11. By contrast, for the purpose of attributing the actions of a non-state armed group to a state in order to determine that an armed conflict is international, the test ultimately endorsed in the ICTY's Tadic case was whether the state exercised 'overall control' over the non-state actor(s). Judgment, Tadic (IT-94-1-A), Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, § 145.

Potentially, as mentioned, the leader could have employed non-state actors (hacker groups) to carry out the operation if their acts are attributable to, or adopted by, the state.¹⁶⁶ The cyber-operation would need to constitute a ‘manifest’ violation of the UN Charter, excluding an operation that is de minimis (insufficient in gravity and/or scale) and/or unclear in terms of its legality/illegality.¹⁶⁷ Yet, because of seemingly extensive jurisdictional limitations¹⁶⁸ — if they are valid¹⁶⁹ — it could be quite difficult to trigger ICC jurisdiction, absent Security Council referral. Here, the specific (and restrictive) jurisdictional regime regarding the crime of aggression (lex specialis) probably overrides the general ICC case law (issued in the context of jurisdiction as to genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) according to which only one element of the crime need to have occurred on the territory of a state party in order to create jurisdiction (lex generalis).¹⁷⁰\n\n¹⁶² See supra notes 80-85 and accompanying text (jurisdiction for crime of aggression).\n¹⁶³ Art. 8bis(2)(d), ICCSt.\n¹⁶⁴ Art. 8bis(2)(b), ICCSt. (emphasis added).\n¹⁶⁵ See K.L. Miller, ‘The Kampala Compromise and Cyberattacks: Can There be an International Crime of Cyber-Aggression?’, 23 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal (2014) 217, at 235 (‘armed’ force could mean ‘all forms of military-sponsored or state-sponsored uses of force’).\n¹⁶⁶ See supra note 161 (attribution).\n¹⁶⁷ The eight factors used in the Tallinn Manual to evaluate when there is a cyber ‘use of force’ could prove useful.

Thus, for example, as to the crime of aggression, even if one element of the crime occurred on the territory of an ICC state party (e.g. at NATO headquarters in Belgium), that would not create jurisdiction over the actions of nationals of a non-state party at NATO headquarters, because the general Rome Statute rules on jurisdiction would be displaced by the more specific regime regarding",
    "Cyber-operations under the Rome Statute 1163\n\nAgain returning to the example of cyber-election interference, and considering it in terms of the crime of aggression, election interference certainly could be considered an attack against ‘sovereignty’, covered by Article 8bis(2).¹⁷¹ Yet, it is questionable whether the interference rises to the level of a ‘manifest’ Charter violation, required by Article 8bis(1). Furthermore, regardless of whether all other elements of the crime could be met, at least one state alleged to be significantly involved in election interference, the Russian Federation,¹⁷² is not a state party to the Rome Statute, so there would be no ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression by Russian nationals whether committed on the territory of the United States or within the territories of other Rome Statute states parties.¹⁷³ Again, the author’s analysis does not imply there should be no ramifications for such election interference. It should also be recalled that national legislation implementing the crime of aggression could omit the ‘manifest’ requirement and would not be restricted by the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional limitations, so could still encompass election interference as the crime of aggression or in some other manner.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nThis article has only touched the surface of what will need to be a far more extensive study of how the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute could potentially encompass cyber-operations. Much has been written by cyber experts on the application of the laws of war to cyber operations and on how IHL violations can create war crimes exposure; that body of writing alone clearly suggests the Rome Statute’s potential applicability. As mentioned, an expert report by the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare¹⁷⁴ will contribute further to exploring these important topics.\n\nWhile the ICC’s cases to date have primarily concerned atrocity crimes committed in less economically developed areas, a role for the Court in addressing even a limited subset of cyber-operations might help to reinforce\n\nthe crime of aggression, which provides there is no jurisdiction regarding the nationals of non-states parties.

Schakelford, ‘The Law of Cyber Peace’, 18 Chicago Journal of International Law (2017) 11 (quoting the Nicaragua case, supra note 39 (as a matter of sovereignty, nations have an obligation not to interfere in one another’s domestic affairs if that intervention relates to ‘the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system’); Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 640 (discussing how cyber-operations can violate sovereignty); Tallinn 2.0, supra note 24, at 17 (‘Rule 4: A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State’).\n\n¹⁷² See Efrony and Shany, supra note 3, at 609–617 (discussing cyber election interference by the Russian Federation).\n\n¹⁷³ Art. 15bis(5) ICCSt.\n\n¹⁷⁴ See supra note 2.",
    "JICJ (2021) 1133-1164\n\nits relevance for states with developed economies¹⁷⁵ — all of which (along with states with developing economies) are experiencing an enormous number of cyber-attacks.¹⁷⁶ Accordingly, various states parties to the Rome Statute may welcome the recognition that certain cyber-operations could constitute Rome Statute crimes, and support the ICC’s addressing of such cases.\n\nOf course, the author sincerely hopes that cyber-operations will never result in fatalities or large-scale physical destruction. Yet, to try to increase potential deterrence of such harmful events, it is important to make clear that the ICC could prosecute certain cyber-operations meeting the legal requirements of the Rome Statute, including gravity. Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset,¹⁷⁷ could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means — a risk that increases as technology continues to develop.\n\n¹⁷⁵ While developed states parties should be ‘willing’ and ‘able’ to use their courts to prosecute cyber-operations, which would render an ICC case ‘inadmissible’, it will depend if the domestic laws of the particular state: (1) encompass the particular conduct at issue, and (2) reach the conduct to the extent it occurred abroad — with perpetrators and victims potentially in many countries. Thus, the totality of the crime might not be ‘able’ to be prosecuted within the domestic courts of any one state party, potentially rendering the case ‘admissible’ before the ICC. States parties that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal codes thereby have at least certain cyber-operations criminalized, but not all states parties have enacted implementing legislation.\n\n¹⁷⁶ As mentioned above, arguably, none of the cyber-operations to date has yet reached the threshold that is probably required by the Rome Statute — with the possible exception of those in Ukraine and the potentially cyber-enabled genocides in Myanmar and against the Uighurs. But see supra note 75 (concerning the jurisdictional principle in the Bangladesh/Myanmar Decision).\n\n¹⁷⁷ Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted."

    "abstract": "This article examines how a cyber-operation that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack — causing serious loss of life or physical damage — could be encompassed within the crimes prosecuted before the International Criminal Court (ICC). It explains when and how such a cyber-operation could fall within the ambit of the ICC's crimes — genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The article additionally acknowledges some limitations as to which cyber-operations would be encompassed, given the ICC's gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could meet the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding such limitations, increased awareness of the previously largely overlooked potential of the Rome Statute to cover certain cyber-operations could potentially contribute to deterring such crimes. Clinical Professor, NYU Center for Global Affairs, USA. The author greatly benefitted from attending meetings of the Council of Advisers on the Application of the Rome Statute to Cyberwarfare, convened by the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, on which she was privileged to serve. See note 2. She also thanks Pano Yannakogeorgos for aiding her understanding of cyber-operations. The author appreciates being able to discuss the article at workshops sponsored by the Ostrom Workshop Program on Cybersecurity and Internet Governance at Indiana University, and at the 2020 International Criminal Court Scholars' Forum. She particularly appreciates the comments of her respective discussants Asaf Lubin and Elies van Sliedregt, as well as the comments and edits of Matthew Cross. Erin Lovall, Kara McDonald, and Samantha Wynne provided research assistance. A shorter version of this article, more focused on deterrence, will appear in S. Shackleford, F. Douzet, and C.
