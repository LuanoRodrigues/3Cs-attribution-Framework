It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nJoanna Kulesza¹\nState responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism\n1. The meaning of an international cyberattack\n²¹st century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality², however the ²¹st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.³\n¹ * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n² D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n³ Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nAttacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia.⁴ However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities⁵ or nationals⁶ shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly\nend of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from:\nhttp://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n⁴ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most \"wired\" country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia, \"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called \"Naszi\" (\"Ours\"). \"Naszi\" did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, \"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe, \"Wired Magazine\" August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n⁵ Synchronized attacks under the codename \"Moonlight Maze\" were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁶ Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nrecognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) $^{7}$ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction $^{8}$ and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. $^{9}$ Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia $^{10}$ or China, $^{11}$ it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. $^{12}$\nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\ninternational aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹³ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression\nAccording to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314¹⁴ in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that\n¹³ United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945\n¹⁴ Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nResolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹⁵\nThe scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹⁶ recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”¹⁷. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it\n¹⁵ According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n¹⁶ UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n¹⁷ Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nadvantages of any kind$^{18}$ (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States$^{19}$ which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction$^{20}$ against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars$^{21}$, as well as U.S.$^{22}$ and Russian authorities$^{23}$, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts\nAs explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case.²⁴ The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible.²⁵ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest.²⁶ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities.²⁷ International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held\ntraditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n²³ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n²⁴ France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²⁵ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁶ Ibid, Art. 3.\n²⁷ Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nresponsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.²⁸\nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision²⁹. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ³⁰ or a person acting on its behalf.³¹\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n²⁸ Ibid, Chapter V.\n²⁹ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n³⁰ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n³¹ Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nConsequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.³²\nHowever in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n³² Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack\nBoth doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence.³³ Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles³⁴, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³⁵ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.³⁶\nIn international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran.³⁷ In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian\n³³ A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³⁴ J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n³⁵ I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n³⁶ See also footnote 3.\n³⁷ United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nauthorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁸ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions³⁹.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results.⁴⁰ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n³⁸ Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n³⁹ M.

State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory.⁴¹ Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks⁴² would be a debate on the sequence of international\n⁴¹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n⁴² See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\njurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet⁴³. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation.⁴⁴ Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here.⁴⁵ Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n⁴³ As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n⁴⁴ An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴⁵ This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nJoanna Kulesza\nState responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism\n1. The meaning of an international cyberattack\nst century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.\n * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nAttacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia. However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities or nationals shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly\nend of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from:\nhttp://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most \"wired\" country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia, \"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called \"Naszi\" (\"Ours\"). \"Naszi\" did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, \"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe, \"Wired Magazine\" August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n Synchronized attacks under the codename \"Moonlight Maze\" were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nrecognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) $^{7}$ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction $^{8}$ and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. $^{9}$ Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia $^{10}$ or China, $^{11}$ it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. $^{12}$\nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\ninternational aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression\nAccording to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314 in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that\n United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nResolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it\n According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nadvantages of any kind$^{18}$ (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States$^{19}$ which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction$^{20}$ against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars$^{21}$, as well as U.S.$^{22}$ and Russian authorities$^{23}$, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts\nAs explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held\ntraditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibid, Art. 3.\n Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nresponsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.\nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ or a person acting on its behalf.\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n Ibid, Chapter V.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nConsequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.\nHowever in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack\nBoth doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence. Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation. This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.\nIn international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran. In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian\n A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n See also footnote 3.\n United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nauthorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n M.

Vark, State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism, „Juridica International” XI/2006, p. 192.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 5. State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory. Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be a debate on the sequence of international\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\njurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation. Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here. Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required.

One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality², however the ²¹st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.³ ¹ * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n² D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n³ Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Attacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia.⁴ However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities⁵ or nationals⁶ shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from: http://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n⁴ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most\"wired\"country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia,\"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called\"Naszi\"(\"Ours\").\"Naszi\"did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz,\"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe,\"Wired Magazine\"August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n⁵ Synchronized attacks under the codename\"Moonlight Maze\"were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁶ Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 recognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia or China, it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. \nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹³ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.",
    "## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression According to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.": "The UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314¹⁴ in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that ¹³ United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945 ¹⁴ Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Resolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹⁵ The scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹⁶ recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”¹⁷. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it ¹⁵ According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n¹⁶ UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n¹⁷ Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 advantages of any kind (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars, as well as U.S. and Russian authorities, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts As explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case.²⁴ The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible.²⁵ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest.²⁶ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities.²⁷ International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n²³ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n²⁴ France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²⁵ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁶ Ibid, Art. 3.\n²⁷ Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.²⁸ Article 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision²⁹. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ³⁰ or a person acting on its behalf.³¹ As mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n²⁸ Ibid, Chapter V.\n²⁹ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n³⁰ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n³¹ Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Consequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.³² However in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n³² Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack Both doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence.³³ Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles³⁴, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³⁵ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.³⁶ In international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran.³⁷ In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian ³³ A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³⁴ J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n³⁵ I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n³⁶ See also footnote 3.\n³⁷ United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁸ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions³⁹.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results.⁴⁰ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n³⁸ Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n³⁹ M.

Vark, State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism, „Juridica International” XI/2006, p. 192.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 5. State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation In the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory.⁴¹ Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks⁴² would be a debate on the sequence of international ⁴¹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n⁴² See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 jurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet⁴³. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation.⁴⁴ Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here.⁴⁵ Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n⁴³ As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n⁴⁴ An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴⁵ This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nJoanna Kulesza\nState responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism\n1. The meaning of an international cyberattack\nst century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.\n * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nAttacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia. However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities or nationals shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly\nend of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from:\nhttp://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most \"wired\" country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia, \"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called \"Naszi\" (\"Ours\"). \"Naszi\" did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, \"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nrecognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) $^{7}$ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction $^{8}$ and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. $^{9}$ Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia $^{10}$ or China, $^{11}$ it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. $^{12}$\nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\ninternational aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression\nAccording to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314 in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that\n United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nResolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it\n According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nadvantages of any kind$^{18}$ (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States$^{19}$ which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction$^{20}$ against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars$^{21}$, as well as U.S.$^{22}$ and Russian authorities$^{23}$, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts\nAs explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held\ntraditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibid, Art. 3.\n Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nresponsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.\nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ or a person acting on its behalf.\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n Ibid, Chapter V.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nConsequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.\nHowever in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack\nBoth doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence. Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation. This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.\nIn international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran. In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian\n A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n See also footnote 3.\n United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nauthorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n M.

State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory. Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be a debate on the sequence of international\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\njurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation. Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here. Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nJoanna Kulesza\nState responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism\n1. The meaning of an international cyberattack\nst century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.\n * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nAttacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia. However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities or nationals shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly\nend of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from:\nhttp://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most \"wired\" country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia, \"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called \"Naszi\" (\"Ours\"). \"Naszi\" did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, \"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe, \"Wired Magazine\" August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n Synchronized attacks under the codename \"Moonlight Maze\" were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nrecognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) $^{7}$ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction $^{8}$ and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. $^{9}$ Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia $^{10}$ or China, $^{11}$ it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. $^{12}$\nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\ninternational aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression\nAccording to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314 in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that\n United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nResolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it\n According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nadvantages of any kind$^{18}$ (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States$^{19}$ which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction$^{20}$ against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars$^{21}$, as well as U.S.$^{22}$ and Russian authorities$^{23}$, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts\nAs explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held\ntraditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibid, Art. 3.\n Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nresponsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.\nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ or a person acting on its behalf.\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n Ibid, Chapter V.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nConsequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.\nHowever in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack\nBoth doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence. Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation. This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.\nIn international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran. In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian\n A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n See also footnote 3.\n United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nauthorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n M.

Vark, State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism, „Juridica International” XI/2006, p. 192.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 5. State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory. Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be a debate on the sequence of international\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\njurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation. Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here. Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nJoanna Kulesza¹\nState responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism\n1. The meaning of an international cyberattack\n²¹st century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality², however the ²¹st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.³\n¹ * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n² D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n³ Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nAttacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia.⁴ However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities⁵ or nationals⁶ shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly\nend of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from:\nhttp://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n⁴ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most \"wired\" country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia, \"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called \"Naszi\" (\"Ours\"). \"Naszi\" did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, \"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe, \"Wired Magazine\" August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n⁵ Synchronized attacks under the codename \"Moonlight Maze\" were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁶ Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nrecognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) $^{7}$ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction $^{8}$ and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. $^{9}$ Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia $^{10}$ or China, $^{11}$ it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. $^{12}$\nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\ninternational aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹³ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression\nAccording to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314¹⁴ in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that\n¹³ United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945\n¹⁴ Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nResolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹⁵\nThe scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹⁶ recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”¹⁷. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it\n¹⁵ According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n¹⁶ UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n¹⁷ Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nadvantages of any kind$^{18}$ (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States$^{19}$ which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction$^{20}$ against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars$^{21}$, as well as U.S.$^{22}$ and Russian authorities$^{23}$, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts\nAs explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case.²⁴ The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible.²⁵ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest.²⁶ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities.²⁷ International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held\ntraditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n²³ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n²⁴ France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²⁵ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁶ Ibid, Art. 3.\n²⁷ Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nresponsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.²⁸\nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision²⁹. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ³⁰ or a person acting on its behalf.³¹\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n²⁸ Ibid, Chapter V.\n²⁹ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n³⁰ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n³¹ Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nConsequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.³²\nHowever in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n³² Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack\nBoth doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence.³³ Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles³⁴, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³⁵ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.³⁶\nIn international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran.³⁷ In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian\n³³ A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³⁴ J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n³⁵ I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n³⁶ See also footnote 3.\n³⁷ United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\nauthorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁸ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions³⁹.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results.⁴⁰ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n³⁸ Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n³⁹ M.

Vark, State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism, „Juridica International” XI/2006, p. 192.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\n# 5. State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory.⁴¹ Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks⁴² would be a debate on the sequence of international\n⁴¹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n⁴² See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223\njurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet⁴³. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation.⁴⁴ Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here.⁴⁵ Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n⁴³ As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n⁴⁴ An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴⁵ This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Joanna Kulesza¹ State responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism ²¹st century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality², however the ²¹st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.³ ¹ * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n² D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n³ Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Attacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia.⁴ However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities⁵ or nationals⁶ shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from: http://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n⁴ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most\"wired\"country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia,\"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called\"Naszi\"(\"Ours\").\"Naszi\"did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz,\"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html).

Shackelford, From Nuclear War To Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks In International Law, Stanford University, 2008, retrieved from: http://works.bepress.com/context/scott_shackelford/article/1004/type/native/viewcontent; a detailed description of the Estonia attacks timeline: J. Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe,\"Wired Magazine\"August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n⁵ Synchronized attacks under the codename\"Moonlight Maze\"were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁶ Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 recognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia or China, it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. \nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹³ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.\n## 2. Legal qualification of cyberattacks as acts of aggression According to Article 2 par. 4 UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state” (emphasis added). The problem here lies not within the qualification of interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure as “using force”, as that can be done quite easily. The real challenge is the fact that the general clause of Article 2 par. 4 is enforced with very few tangible resources that may be used for protecting state sovereignty against armed attacks. Their narrow scope is set according to Article 51 UNC, which conforms states’ right to resolve to self-defence only if they be subject to “an armed attack” (emphasis added). Therefore the answer to the question of legality of an armed self-defence against a cyber-attack will lie within the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be looked into. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in the Resolution 3314¹⁴ in principle both invasion and attack against state territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack, when it enables its territory to armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that ¹³ United Nations Charter, Signed in San Francisco, California on June 26, 1945 ¹⁴ Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Resolution 3314 does not allow to qualify an attack onto state key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires, accompanying the Resolution where it was explicitly set that any other acts, outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequence, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹⁵ The scope of exercising “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when recalling the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is being defined very narrowly and the allowed use of an armed self-defence is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope defined, they may not be recalled as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities. However, the term of “using force”, mentioned in Article 2 par. 4 UNC, has been defined expansively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When qualifying cyberattacks in the context of international law this definition may show very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹⁶ recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, “for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State” as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but “all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements”¹⁷. According to its terms, “no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it ¹⁵ According to A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski such narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the fact of rejecting Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as also constituting international aggression (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe. (Public international law. Systemic issues.), Warszawa 1999, p. 486).\n¹⁶ UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n¹⁷ Ibid, Preamble, pt. 1.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 advantages of any kind (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which in Article 32 stipulates that “no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”.\nThese documents permit to regard the interference with state’s critical electronic infrastructure as using “any other type of measures to coerce another State” and therefore a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated when measures used were aimed at “coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination” (in the case of attack against Estonia such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the center of Tallinn to its outskirts) or “to secure from it advantages of any kind” (e.g. the obvious “advantages” resulting to the benefit of any state stealing away other states’ secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed aggression, allowing for self-defence procedures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, which undertook no reaction against Russia in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars, as well as U.S. and Russian authorities, who declare the applicability of all self-defence mechanism, including a sudden nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 3. Basic rules of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts As explained above cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression” they may however be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially set by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the Lotus case.²⁴ The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify any damage resulting from such breach. With time international law practice elaborated a sequence of principles shaping the international state responsibility framework. According to those principles three prerequisites are required ascertained for a state to be held internationally responsible.²⁵ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation or harm of a legally protected state interest.²⁶ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to the state and its authorities.²⁷ International law foresees a number of exceptions, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations, May 1999, p. 20, retrieved from: http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty on the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He called upon Article 51 UNC and stated, that according to its disposition a cyberattack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” should it allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyberattack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyberattack are much more important than the means used for conducting it. (Ibid, p. 22).\n²³ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons.” (see, S. J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 28).\n²⁴ France v. Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²⁵ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding those principles. Those rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of a common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far those principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁶ Ibid, Art. 3.\n²⁷ Ibid, Art. 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can occur.²⁸ Article 3 of the ILC Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further specified by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision²⁹. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations. They - in principle - result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*) or, in other words, they are norms that the state is obliged to fulfill in the interest of the entire international community. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ³⁰ or a person acting on its behalf.³¹ As mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility involves also one negative prerequisite. A state may waive international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law. For it to be held responsible, none of them may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: the consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous event (article 31), extreme distress, required by the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 UNC (article 34).\n²⁸ Ibid, Chapter V.\n²⁹ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain. ICJ, 1970, ICJ Rep 174.\n³⁰ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, possibly on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n³¹ Art. 7 and 8 of the ILC Draft Articles.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Consequently, in order to establish international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nIdentifying an international norm that cyber-attacks constitute the breach of is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks onto state key infrastructure conducted through electronic means as “a n y o t h e r t y p e o f m e a s u r e s to coerce another State”, therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is, however, more difficult is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, one that initiated it or allowed for it happen. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons, but only if they are acting on its behalf or order. At the present state of technical development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which cyber-attacks were conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be greatly unjustified, since a state does not carry the responsibility for actions of its residents operating hardware located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state will only be responsible for those of its residents, it explicitly authorized to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might show excessively difficult and deem unsuccessful any reparatory proceedings.³² However in the light of existing international law doctrine a state may also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not for its actions but for its omission, or in other words for not preventing that attack to take place.\n³² Both: Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers acting from their territories.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 4. State attribution of a cyber-attack Both doctrine and judiciary make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, particularly for not exercising due diligence.³³ Such an interpretation is derived from the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles³⁴, this article regards a situation in which a state is in “breach of obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to show best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable” and “necessary” measures in order to prevent a given incident to happen, however, without a warranty that it will not occur. The doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³⁵ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Naszi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent (or persecute) them.³⁶ In international judicature this mechanism was best reflected in the ICJ case concerning United States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran.³⁷ In its decision the ICJ found, that the overriding of the U.S. embassy in Teheran, although may not be attributed to Iran, does not free that state from responsibility for that incident. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian ³³ A. Wyrozumska and W. Czaplinski give an example of not fulfilling the due diligence standard by neglecting to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks combined with denial to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, as well as an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (A. Wyrozumska, W. Czaplinski, supra note 14, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of a recent announcement of a Russian authorities, admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Naszi” organization; see also: I. Brownlie System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism of establishing state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³⁴ J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 140.\n³⁵ I. Brownlie, supra note 32, pp. 162-163.\n³⁶ See also footnote 3.\n³⁷ United States of America v. Iran, ICJ, ICJ Rep. 1980, p. 3.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations: to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran against the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁸ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be fulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility for natural persons’ actions³⁹.\nThe very same legal construction appears in a case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from the Article 2(4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be comprehended as both: an intolerability of any active intrusion into internal affairs of a state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion of foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark resulting from the scope of such an obligation is the duty of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate such a harmful deed or – if it may not be prevented – its results.⁴⁰ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may also not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while they are protected by its immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s denial to persecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerate a state from any international responsibility.\n³⁸ Ibid, 42, p. 29.\n³⁹ M.

Vark, State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism, „Juridica International” XI/2006, p. 192.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 # 5. State responsibility for cyber-attacks - the need for an international regulation In the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to an urgent problem of legal qualification of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of Internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In the light of statements made by national authorities from countries that are often subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. considering a nuclear response to cyberwarfare) such a debate seems essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the due diligence criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for failing to protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks conducted from its territory.⁴¹ Such an accord would allow to avoid dangerous reactions of particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by deciding upon the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, dependant on the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowed self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from any international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient or would state authorities need to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified, whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack had already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on the international responsibility for cyber-attacks⁴² would be a debate on the sequence of international ⁴¹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the measures considered necessary for a state to be taken.\n⁴² See e.g. R. Hughes, A treaty for cyberspace, International Affairs, Volume 86, Issue 2, pages 523–541, March 2010.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 jurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet⁴³. Only reaching such an accord will allow to avoid distant analogies to existing international law regimes and contradictory national regulation.⁴⁴ Such an international consensus could set the base for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regime for cyberspace is already in the scope of interest of some international organizations, including the Internet Governance Forum. IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating satisfying consensus on the issue discussed here.⁴⁵ Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks onto other sovereigns conducted from its territory through the internet, the worst case scenario is the interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC done autonomously by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such an event should be prevented with any means possible.\n⁴³ As with all activities in cyberspace, resolving to the traditional set of jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. More on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008, retrieved from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1445452.\n⁴⁴ An example of such a far-going analogy was presented by S.J. Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff., e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application can lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴⁵ This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme did not fulfil the tasks assigned to it More on the summary of IGF efforts: J.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of international debate. Afterwards, it turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for the lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and persecute electronic attacks. The article submits in this context that an international debate, resulting in international guidelines is required. The results of such a debate would than allow harmonize national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need of an international debate on the system of protection against cyberattacks on state key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted form their territory.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Joanna Kulesza¹ State responsibility for acts of cyber-terrorism ²¹st century saw the dawn of new methods for international rivalry, including warfare. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution was the popularization of the Internet — the biggest, world-wide electronic network. Every country prides itself on developments in e-administration and e-government but also invests in computer-controlled power plants and computer operated flight and airport control systems. The massive popularity of on-line banking brings essential benefits to private individuals and international companies alike. All those developments result however also in the fact that the security of crucial national infrastructure elements, such as state airports and power supplies, became only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. New century brought therefore new ways of exposing state vulnerability and new means of indispensable state protection were called for.\nThis new category of risks for state security may be defined as an element of an already known term: Information Warfare (IW). This expression traditionally covers actions undertaken by one party aimed at “disrupting the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality², however the ²¹st century gave this term a new meaning and scope wider and more diverse than ever before.³ ¹ * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D., assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relation, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Lodz.\n² D. Delibasis, The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations, Bury St Edmunds 2007, p. 25.\n³ Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (Ibidem, p. 31 ff.), however, the IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (Ibidem, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, since it is the US military security system that is the target of the largest number of cyberattacks worldwide. The average amount of cyberattacks upon the US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 Attacks conducted with the use of the Internet (cyber-attacks) onto key information infrastructures of sovereign states are best represented by the 2007 attack on Estonia.⁴ However the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic systems, attributed to state authorities⁵ or nationals⁶ shows the gravity of danger brought by this new category of the IW – the cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified. (Ibidem, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damages caused by cyberattacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (mib, 100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców, Gazeta Wyborcza, April 4, 2009, retrieved from: http://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,85253,6478435,100_milionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html).\n⁴ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most\"wired\"country in the world (therefore the state was sometimes nicknamed Estonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (I. Traynor, Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia,\"The Guardian\", May 17th, 2007, retrieved from: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative, although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called\"Naszi\"(\"Ours\").\"Naszi\"did claim the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities (Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz,\"Financial Times\", March 11, 2009, retrieved from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin's closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming the attack also by Russian authorities (R. Coalson, Behind The Estonia Cyberattacks, Radio Free Europe, March 6, 2009, retrieved from: http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html). A thorough analysis of facts and legal implications of the Estonia attacks: S. J. Shackelford, From Nuclear War To Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks In International Law, Stanford University, 2008, retrieved from: http://works.bepress.com/context/scott_shackelford/article/1004/type/native/viewcontent; a detailed description of the Estonia attacks timeline: J. Davies, Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe,\"Wired Magazine\"August 21 2007, retrieved from: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia.\n⁵ Synchronized attacks under the codename\"Moonlight Maze\"were initiated from the Russian Academy of Sciences, closely bound with the Russian Ministry of Defence and army. The attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁶ Codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks aimed at secret electronic data of the United States, conducted in February of 1998. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas, further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (D. Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 recognized e.g. by the European Union in its i2010 agenda) the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyberattacks is of growing and urging importance. Its significance is enhanced by the alarming declarations of authorities of the countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example both: Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyberattacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction and declare they feel authorized to initiate a traditional armed attack against any cyber-trespassers. Since the main parties of the information battlefield are world's most influential powers, often in disposition of nuclear arsenal, such as the United States, Russia or China, it is of key importance to clearly set the limits of self-defence against cyberattacks onto national databases and security systems allowed by international law. \nThe aim of this article is to look at the present legal order of international responsibility of states and try to apply it to cyberattacks. The author attempts to define the legal character of cyberattacks, particularly whether such attacks may be regarded as acts of Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809223 international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including an armed self-defence, as set by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹³ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when can cyber-attacks be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since so far there is no particular international regulation on that matter, one has to apply to this new and unique situation the existing international law mechanisms. The author attempts to identify those mechanisms and propose their required modifications.",
