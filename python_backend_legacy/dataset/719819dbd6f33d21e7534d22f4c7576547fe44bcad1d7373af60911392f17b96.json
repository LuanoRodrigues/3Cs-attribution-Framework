This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\n\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\n\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Introduction and content\n\nInformation and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵\n\nBuilding on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested:\n\n“In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷\n\nThis norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\n\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on:\n\n- The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges\n- The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸\n- Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm\n- The proposals for an international attribution mechanism\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n1.

            "markdown": "# 2. The concept of attribution\n\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\n\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\n\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\n\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\n\nCountermeasures must be\n\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\n\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\n\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\n\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\n\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\n\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\n\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS",

The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\n\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\n\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\n\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

If, for instance, the State injured by the\n\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\n\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\n\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n\n37 Joyner (2006).\n38 UNGA (2002, Annex, ch II cmt 3).\n39 Kastelic (2020); Wan et al.

Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\n\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\n\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\n\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\n\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\n\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\n\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Suggestions for operationalization\n\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\n\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\n\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\n\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\n\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions.

Legal aspects of attribution\n\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\n\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\n\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\n\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\n\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\n\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\n\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\n\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\n\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\n\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\n\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\n\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS",

While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\n\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\n\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\n\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\n\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\n\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\n\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\n\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\n\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\n\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\n\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\n\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\n\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS",

The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\n\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\n\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\n\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\n\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

A possible international attribution mechanism?\n\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\n\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\n\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\n\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\n\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\n\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\n\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

Conclusion\n\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\n\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\n\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\n\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\n\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\n\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\n\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\n\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\n\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n2\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nSection 5\ni) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\nn) Using various international forums to further discuss the proposal for an international attribution mechanism, including the envisioned benefits and pitfalls.\n# 1. Introduction and content\nInformation and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵\nBuilding on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested:\n“In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷\nThis norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on:\n- The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges\n- The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸\n- Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm\n- The proposals for an international attribution mechanism\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n1.

The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n37 Joyner (2006).\n38 UNGA (2002, Annex, ch II cmt 3).\n39 Kastelic (2020); Wan et al.

Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n18 FACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\nSection 5 i) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\nn) Using various international forums to further discuss the proposal for an international attribution mechanism, including the envisioned benefits and pitfalls.\n# 1. Introduction and content Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵ Building on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested: “In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷ This norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on: - The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges - The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸ - Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm - The proposals for an international attribution mechanism UNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 2. The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n\n# 3. Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\nSection 5 i) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\nn) Using various international forums to further discuss the proposal for an international attribution mechanism, including the envisioned benefits and pitfalls.\n# 1. Introduction and content Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵ Building on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested: “In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷ This norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on: - The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges - The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸ - Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm - The proposals for an international attribution mechanism UNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 2. The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n\n# 3. Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS",

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\nSection 5 i) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\nn) Using various international forums to further discuss the proposal for an international attribution mechanism, including the envisioned benefits and pitfalls.\n# 1. Introduction and content Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵ Building on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested: “In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷ This norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on: - The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges - The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸ - Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm - The proposals for an international attribution mechanism UNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 2. The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n\n# 3. Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS"

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n2\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nSection 5\ni) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\nn) Using various international forums to further discuss the proposal for an international attribution mechanism, including the envisioned benefits and pitfalls.\n# 1. Introduction and content\nInformation and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵\nBuilding on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested:\n“In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷\nThis norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on:\n- The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges\n- The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸\n- Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm\n- The proposals for an international attribution mechanism\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n1.

The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace. The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n37 Joyner (2006).\n38 UNGA (2002, Annex, ch II cmt 3).\n39 Kastelic (2020); Wan et al. (2021).\n40 United States Department of Defense (2018, 38).\n# 3. Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility. This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation. When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution. But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures, the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\". However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\" manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace. States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility. The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public. Public attribution relies on publicity, which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States. Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust. Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States. However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\" while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing and sufficient evidence. Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing. It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims. Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\" the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n18 FACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency, have been seen as biased, and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced. This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS"

This paper analyses these three aspects through the prism of the normative expectations of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. As a result, the paper makes a number of suggestions of how to consider the challenges of attribution and how to operationalize norm B of the 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.\nTo this end, and with a view to facilitating non-escalatory reaction to an information and communications technology (ICT) incident, the prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, this paper suggest that States consider the following measures:\nSection 3\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence.\nb) Establishing and institutionalizing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. The attribution process would benefit from engaging the policy and political community, law enforcement, the intelligence apparatus, the private sector, academia, the diplomatic community and legal experts.\nc) Establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners. This will facilitate cooperation when an incident occurs, facilitate prevention of potential escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States.\nd) Indicating the degree of confidence in the conclusions of technical or factual investigation and the analysis of the cyber incident. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response.\ne) Approaching the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of State responsibility if the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful.\nf) Developing interpretation of the international law of State responsibility in the context of ICT operations.\ng) Sharing those interpretations with the wider international community. This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nh) Engaging in dialogue with all the States involved, and only resorting to any international reactions by way of, for example, retorsion or countermeasures when the dialogue fails.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\nSection 5 i) Taking into account the respective benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution, when deciding on the format of attribution based on its desired effects, each State should critically in cases the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises.\nj) Aiming to substantiate the attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law.\nk) Striving to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nl) Continuing to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\nm) Resorting to various confidence-building measures and sharing the standards of proof with the international community.

Introduction and content Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have endowed our societies with immense opportunities.¹ The challenges of the digital domain to international peace and stability however “risk overshadowing [the] benefits”.² Malicious cyber operations are more and more frequent³ and so are the accompanying attribution claims.⁴ Attribution of malicious cyber operations, however, is a challenging endeavour and erroneous claims of responsibility “could result in significant consequences, including in unintended armed responses and escalation”.⁵ Building on the work of past United Nations processes on international ICT security⁶ and acknowledging the challenges of attribution, the 2021 Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE) suggested: “In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment, and the nature and extent of the consequences.”⁷ This norm sets an expectation that a State targeted by a malicious cyber operation will consider the context of the incident when deliberating its reaction, as accurate attribution is key to a non-escalatory response to a malicious inter-State cyber operation. This is particularly the case in the context of an ICT incident that amounts to a breach of international law, especially when the initial malicious cyber operation is considered to have amounted to an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence by cyber as well as other means.\nIn order to facilitate implementation of the norm, this paper elaborates on: - The concept of attribution, including its purpose and the related challenges - The three aspects of attribution: technical or factual, legal, and political, which, despite the doctrinal demarcation between them, are very much related and often intertwined⁸ - Aspect-specific suggestions for operationalization of the norm - The proposals for an international attribution mechanism UNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 2. The concept of attribution\nAttribution denotes the allocation of direct or indirect responsibility for a malicious cyber operation. It involves the determination of the origin or authorship of the cyber operation. Generally, thus, a cyber operation can be attributed to a natural person or a group of natural persons, an ICT system of origin, or a State. Given the context of advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, the primary focus of the norm and therefore of this paper is the attribution of a malicious cyber operation to a particular State or group of States.\nAttribution involves a process of several distinct and potentially overlapping elements:\n- Evidence collection and analysis\n- Legal analysis\n- Decision-making and communication\nEvidence collection and analysis are part of the fact-finding stage of attribution, providing the foundation for the legitimacy of the following political act of attribution of a malicious cyber operation. In the event that a cyber operation amounts to a breach of the international rights of a State, technical or factual investigation and analysis are key elements in the legal test of attribution, in invocation of State responsibility and in employment of countermeasures as authorized by customary international law.\nCountermeasures are non-punitive, compliance-inducing measures intended to secure cessation of and reparation for internationally wrongful conduct. Otherwise unlawful, wrongfulness of a countermeasure taken in response to an internationally wrongful act is precluded according to the customary international law of State responsibility.[9]\nCountermeasures must be\n- non-forcible in nature $^{10}$\n- reversible as far as possible $^{11}$\n- quantitively as well as qualitatively proportionate to the initial wrongdoing $^{12}$\nThe methods of countermeasures are not limited to the methods of the initial wrongdoing or, in other words, if an internationally wrongful act is perpetrated by way of a cyber operation, countermeasures need not be a cyber operation.\n# 2.1. The purpose of attribution\nThe ultimate purpose of attribution is to induce compliance either by deterrence or by imposing costs on the wrongdoing party. This promotes accountability and the rule of international law.\nIn pursuing deterrence, attribution could be a way of signalling the limits of expected State behaviour in cyberspace.[13] The limits may be the universally agreed voluntary norms\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nadopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015¹⁴ or other arbitrary limits of acceptable behaviour.¹⁵ Additionally, attribution may signal the attribution capabilities of the targeted State, thus dispelling the popular notion that attribution is nearly impossible and the myth of the anonymity of malicious cyber deeds.\nMalicious cyber operations can also be attributed with a view to imposing costs on the wrongdoing party¹⁶ and in doing so alter its rational choice calculus.¹⁷ Attribution coupled with a detailed description of the malicious cyber operation can expose the exploits used, giving the opportunity to the ICT community to patch the vulnerabilities, and so rendering the malicious tools less effective in the future. Moreover, public attribution claims may impose reputational costs on the responsible party. Scholarship has emphasized the importance of reputation in international relations.¹⁸ However, the potential for compliance to be induced by reputational costs incurred due to public ascription of responsibility for non-conformist behaviour remains seriously disputed.¹⁹\nBeyond reputational costs, attribution is key to legitimate imposition of reparations, which is another form of cost for wrongdoers. Being the necessary element of State responsibility, attribution legitimizes the injured State to take countermeasures in order to secure cessation of the internationally wrongful cyber operation and reparations for its consequences.²⁰\n## 2.2. Attribution challenges\nSeveral States have pledged investments in their attribution capabilities in the past decade.²¹ Nevertheless, the challenges associate with attribution²² of cyber operations persist and stem from the technological structure of ICT systems. The origin of a malicious cyber operation can be obfuscated by such underlying technology mechanisms as:\n- Use of botnets²³\n- The privacy of domain registration²⁴\n- Various spoofing and false flag techniques²⁵\n- Use of proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs) and onion routing²⁶\n- Dynamic allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\n- Covert communication, including encryption²⁷\n- Using compromised third-party infrastructure\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nFurther analysis of the range of obfuscation techniques is beyond the scope of this paper and a wealth of dedicated literature exists on this particular topic;²⁸ suffice to say that the techniques are plentiful, diverse and, much like the threat landscape, ever evolving.²⁹ This is also one of the reasons why the development of attribution capabilities may require a significant and continuous investment, which may not be available to all States.\nEven with the growing number of cases of public attribution of malicious cyber operations, “the lack of accountability in cyberspace”³⁰ appears to be a challenge. The consequent absence of deterrence may encourage the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities.³¹\n## 2.3. Misattribution and the potential for escalation\nThe challenges of attribution elaborated above mean that the likelihood of misattribution should not be dismissed. Although there are perhaps endless theoretical scenarios with the potential to lead to misattribution, it can simply result from an inadequate quality or quantity of evidence, which fails to provide sufficient proof of origin or authorship. Misattribution can also result from hasty or biased political decisions before completion of the factual investigation, which can be a lengthy procedure.³²\nIn the initial stage of attribution, the investigators and analysts can be deceived by various spoofing and false flag techniques employed by the author of the malicious cyber operation.³³ Moreover, the political decision-making phase may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions based on a disproportionate reliance on circumstantial evidence and on conclusions by inference. Legal operation of attribution can lead to incorrect results if the nexus between the responsible natural person and a State is not established in line with the relevant provisions of the customary law of State responsibility. This includes attribution claims based on the inaccurate assumption that the geographic origin of a cyber operation automatically entails responsibility of the State with jurisdiction over the particular territory³⁴ or that the responsible group of individuals acted on behalf of that particular State.\nIn certain circumstances, “misattribution is a real possibility and can carry serious consequences for international relations, peace and security”.³⁵ For instance, if a State injured by a cyber operation reacts with measures of retorsion taken against the innocent State, this may result in deterioration of the bilateral relationship.³⁶ This potential for deterioration is further envisioned in the case where the innocent State decides to respond to misattribution with more than rejection of responsibility.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nMeasures of retorsion are unfriendly but lawful reaction measures, intended to compel another State to cease behaviour that is considered unfriendly or undesired but is still consistent with the international obligations of the State. \"Acts of retorsion involve non-violent, lawful acts by both parties, without resort to armed force.\"³⁷ Retorsion can manifest in, for instance, various forms of sanctions, embargoes or severing of diplomatic ties among others.³⁸\nA threat to peace and security can materialize when the initial cyber operation deprives the targeted State of its international rights. If, for instance, the State injured by the\nmalicious cyber operation launches countermeasures based on erroneous attribution, those countermeasures in themselves constitute a violation of the international legal obligations.\nWhat is more, a self-defence response to a cyber operation amounting to an armed attack based on misattribution can trigger a forcible response and thus considerably worsen international peace and security;³⁹ in the event of a cyber operation of sufficient scale and magnitude, such a response could potentially include the use of nuclear weapons.⁴⁰\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n\n# 3. Technical and factual aspects of attribution\nFollowing an ICT incident, the attribution process begins with the technical or factual investigation of the incident. Investigation predominantly focuses on uncovering the origin of the malicious cyber operation and the natural person in control of the originating ICT system. As such it seeks to establish responsibility in fact.\nTechnical aspects of attribution frequently consider such elements of the incident as malware (signatures, complexity, code clues) and the systems used by the malicious cyber actors, paying particular attention to elements such as command and control servers, domains used, IP addresses, and traffic analysis among other things.\nScholarship has developed a taxonomy of technical investigation techniques that lists the following clusters of technical attribution methods:\n- Manual attribution\n- Traceback mechanisms\n- Stepping-stone attribution\n- Payload attribution\n- Honeypots\n- Internet redesign41\nThe technical investigation part of attribution is not the exclusive domain of the competent national authorities. Non-State actors, such as private enterprises as well as\nacademia, frequently publish technical reports detailing the operation or operators of malware. $^{42}$  This may be used in the investigation efforts of the competent national authorities. $^{43}$  The above-mentioned analysis may indeed aid the official investigation of the incident although it does also carry associated risks. $^{44}$\nIn an attempt to attribute a malicious cyber operation, technical analysis of the incident is supplemented with other sources of information that are not strictly focused on the technology and malware at the centre of the cyber operation.[45]\n# 3.1. Socio-political methods of investigation\nThe investigation of tactics, techniques and procedures focuses on the methods of the malicious actors.46 Additional socio-political and behavioural methods of investigation complement the technical analysis; these can seek to establish attribution based on indicators such as who benefitted from the malicious operation;47 language (mis)used by the malware authors;48 keyboard layout; domain registration information;49 behavioural biometric data (keystrokes, mouse and touch input);50 and the operating hours of the alleged orchestrators of a cyber operation.51\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n## 3.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn order to strengthen the technical or factual investigation of the incidents and to facilitate accurate and non-escalatory attribution, States could consider the following measures:\na) Developing technical capacity to enable investigation of ICT incidents. This includes capacities related to the collection and custody of evidence. Given the interconnected nature of ICT systems and the fact that the investigation would be likely to benefit from international cooperation mechanisms, States should consider assisting other countries with the development of relevant investigation capacities.^[52]^\nb) Consider establishing mechanisms for cooperation between relevant domestic stakeholders. While the technical and intelligence authorities should probably be the leading entities in the investigation efforts,^[53]^ the process should be inclusive and would benefit from the engagement of representatives of the political and policy, diplomatic and legal communities. Investigation efforts could also benefit from the insight of the private sector.^[54]^ Some States have officially recognized the value of the private sector and have pledged to collaborate in attribution efforts.^[55]^ States should also consider engaging with academia, which can support the incident investigation with advanced and impartial attribution advice.^[56]^ To enable a multi-stakeholder approach to incident investigation, States should enact the relevant enabling domestic legal and policy frameworks.\nc) Moreover – and as suggested by the additional layer of understanding in the 2021 GGE report – States “are encouraged to consult among relevant competent authorities”.^[57]^ This may contribute to the prevention of potentially escalatory mis-attribution and facilitate trust among States. To enable such communication, States should consider establishing cooperative mechanisms with international partners, which will facilitate cooperation when the incident occurs.\nd) Technical or factual investigation and analysis of the cyber incident should indicate the degree of confidence in the conclusions. This will enable the decision makers to make an informed decision regarding the communication of the attribution claim and its format. It will also assist them as they consider the response to ICT incidents.\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\n# 4. Legal aspects of attribution\nWhile the technical or factual investigation seeks to indicate the responsible natural person or the territory of origin and thus to establish responsibility in fact, the legal analysis aims to establish attribution in law. The aim of attribution as a normative operation is to establish the legal responsibility of a State.\nUntil special rules are agreed upon or the progressive development of international law gives rise to a context-specific framework, the customary international law of State responsibility is considered to be the applicable regime governing the legal attribution of the wrongful cyber operations. The applicability of this particular international legal regime to wrongful cyber operations has been confirmed by several States.[58]\nAccording to the international law of State responsibility, conduct attributable to a State and amounting to a breach of international obligations results in State responsibility.[59] This triggers the emergence of the secondary obligations of cessation, non-repetition and reparation.[60] When the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act fails to comply with the resulting secondary obligations, the injured State is legally empowered to take countermeasures.[61]\nIndeed, legal attribution is an important legitimizing factor for reparations as well as, potentially, countermeasures, both of which\ninflict costs on the responsible State and have an impact on more than its reputation. According to the international law of State responsibility, any State responsible for internationally wrongful cyber operations is under an obligation to cease the non-compliant conduct and to provide reparations to the injured State.[62]\nNot all cyber operations and not all responses dictate legal considerations of attribution. In the context of attribution, the 2021 GGE report distinguishes between two types of malicious cyber operation targeting States: cyber operations that amount to a breach of international obligations of States and cyber operations that do not. The normative expectations imply that the former type of operation necessitates legal considerations in the process of attribution.[63] But whether the targeted State should consider the international law of attribution further depends on the desired response to the cyber operation. If the State is considering taking measures of retorsion in response to a cyber operation[64] - whether or not it amounts to an internationally wrongful act - legal considerations of attribution are not necessary. In contrast, if a State is contemplating taking countermeasures,[65] the law of State responsibility prescribes an attribution framework that is designed to prevent the escalation of tension.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nOne of the elements of the law of State responsibility intended to prevent escalation is the obligation of the injured State to invite the responsible State to return to compliance and to notify it of its intention to take countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) argued that, \"the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it\".66 The expectations of engagement in dialogue prior to a reaction to a wrongful cyber operation is repeated in the additional layer of understanding found in the 2021 GGE report.67\n## 4.1. The nexus between a State and a natural person\nTo proceed with the legal attribution analysis of a cyber operation, the injured State would normally need to be in possession of factual evidence implicating the natural person perpetrating the operation. This is not a requirement of the relevant international law or the voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. It is purely a practical consideration – as the Permanent Court of International Justice put it in 1923, “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives”,68 that is, persons in flesh and blood.69\nAttribution in law and the responsibility of a particular State cannot be automatically established based on the nationality of the natural person perpetrating the act or the territorial origin of the cyber operation.70 To establish attribution in law, the injured State should be able to establish a nexus between a natural person perpetrating the cyber operation or the territory of origin and a particular State.\nCyber operations conducted by a State organ, even if not legally empowered to conduct malicious cyber operations, can be legally attributed to a particular State. The same is true for cyber operations conducted by a foreign organ placed at the disposal of another State and operations conducted by entities empowered to exercise government authority. According to the law of State responsibility, an entity being instructed, controlled or directed by a State can also result in State responsibility.71 The jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that an act conducted by a non-State actor and later adopted by a State organ as its own can equally amount to the international responsibility of a State.72\nIt remains unclear what degree of control over a non-State actor would constitute a sufficient attribution nexus and allow for the invocation of State responsibility. Jurisprudence suggests two possible interpretations of the law.\nOn the one hand, the ICJ has argued that States are responsible for the conduct of a non-State actor only when the State in question is found to have directed or enforced the perpetration of the specific acts contrary to international law.73 A number of States argued for the adoption of this control standard in relation to the legal attribution of cyber operations.74\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to establish international responsibility of the State when it is considered to have exhibited overall control over the non-State actor. While deliberating on the question of international criminal responsibility, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also touched upon State responsibility. In a 1999 judgement, the tribunal argued that the overall control test would be satisfied (so giving rise to State responsibility) when a State is found to have been \"not only ... equipping and financing the group, but also ... coordinating or helping in the general planning of [the malicious] activity\".[75] However, overall control is considered to be sufficient only for the purpose of establishing State responsibility in the event of cyber perpetrators being found to have acted in an \"organized and hierarchically structured\"[76] manner. Despite these limitations to applicability, scholars such as Shackelford and Tsagourias have argued against disregarding the overall control standard in the context of cyberspace.[77] States currently remain hesitant to endorse the use of this standard in the context of cyber operations.\n## 4.2. Suggestions for operationalization\nConsidering this, implementation of the following suggestions will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents and contribute to the progressive development of the relevant international law.\na) If the cyber operation in question is deemed to be internationally wrongful, the injured State should approach the attribution in law in accordance with the provisions of the international law of\nState responsibility. By following the letter of the law, the potential for the injured State to take wrongful countermeasures and thus contribute to aggravating international relations is reduced.\nb) States should develop interpretation of the international law of State responsibility prior to the occurrence of any malicious ICT incident. In particular, each State should consider legal standards emerging from the existing jurisprudence and develop a national interpretation of the relevant international law of attribution. Note, however, that outside the judicial setting, the standard of control sufficient to establish a nexus between the natural person perpetrating a cyber operation and a State remains a political decision.\nc) To facilitate transparency and predictability of international relations, States should share their interpretations of the international law of State responsibility with the wider international community.[78] This would contribute to the progressive development of the international law applicable to State conduct in cyberspace.\nd) Before reacting by way of retorsion or countermeasures, the injured State should engage in dialogue with all the States involved. This is an expectation of the norm and also a requirement of the law of State responsibility.[79] The dialogue will provide the opportunity for the allegedly responsible State or States to challenge the attribution claims and provide evidence in rebuttal.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n.\n# 5. Political aspects of attribution\nPolitical aspects of attribution materialize in the act of allocating responsibility. Indeed, some scholars have labelled this as \"an inherently political act\". In fact, States are under no obligation or expectation to attribute a malicious cyber operation, and assigning responsibility remains a sovereign prerogative of every State.\n# 5.1. Format of attribution\nOne political decision related to attribution is the choice of the format of attribution. Depending on the purpose of attribution, it can be made in private or in public.[82] Public attribution relies on publicity,[83] which may impose reputational costs on the accused State, and overtly signal a particular normative interpretation or technical capability for attribution. On the other hand, public attribution may carry a risk of deterioration of international relations. In these cases, States injured by a malicious cyber operation may wish to communicate the attribution claims in private, which is likely to inflict less strain on the relationships. As is the case with public attribution, private attribution signals attribution capacities and an interpretation of the norm. However, since the audience is limited to the allegedly responsible party, private attribution can reduce the reputational impact. Moreover, by communicating attribution in private, the parties can present evidence and confront arguments surrounding attribution.[84]\nIn recent years, public collective attribution claims have emerged as the preferred attribution format for some coalitions of States.[85] Collective action may raise the perceived level of confidence in the attribution and therefore increase the reputational costs inflicted. However, it is possible that not all coalition members share the same attribution capabilities and so may not be able to independently verify the assertions of the State that claims to have proof of attribution or has initiated the collective attribution. In such a case, the attribution process rests on trust.[86] Additionally, collective attribution requires the alignment of strategic interests and may be slowed by the alignment process needed for the coalition's collective attribution.[87]\n# 5.2. Confidence in the attribution\nAn important part of the relevant political considerations is confidence in the factual underpinning of the attribution claims. Attribution based on proof of dubious quality may carry the risk of misattribution, leading to deterioration of international relations or worse. Whether or not a cyber operation was in violation of the rights of a State, the quality of proof and consequentially attribution confidence should be proportional to the risk carried by the planned response.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nThe burden of the decisions related to confidence and therefore the adequate standard of proof substantiating the aforementioned legal nexus between a State and a perpetrating entity is on the State targeted by a malicious cyber operation. Standards of proof supporting legal attribution outside a judicial setting are not exact; this has been reiterated by a number of States.[88] However, this may very well change in the future; during the OEWG 2021, \"some States highlighted the importance of genuine, reliable and adequate proof in this context\"[89] while other individually argued in favour of adequate, convincing[90] and sufficient evidence.[91] Until then, whether the evidence available amounts to a credible attribution is a matter of political deliberation and subject to self-imposed standards of proof.\nThe standard of proof should be proportionate to the gravity of the alleged wrongdoing.[92] It also depends on the nature of the malicious cyber operation and the intended reaction of the victim State. If the cyber operation qualifies as internationally wrongful conduct and the injured State wishes to employ countermeasures, the self-imposed standards of proof related to attribution claims should be as high as possible in order to avoid misattribution and unlawful countermeasures, which could lead to the deterioration of international relations, including negative impacts on international peace and security. Particularly high self-imposed standards should be considered when the malicious cyber operation reaches the threshold of an armed attack and the targeted State is contemplating self-defence measures. Conversely, more lenient standards of proof can be followed in the event that the reaction of the targeted State is within the realm of merely unfriendly acts.\nIn establishing attribution for the purpose of invoking State responsibility, the injured State is under no obligation to provide evidence and to prove its attribution claims.[93] Nevertheless, in line with the 2021 GGE report, the State targeted by an internationally wrongful cyber operation \"should substantiate\"[94] the attribution claims. In consideration of a non-escalatory response and the aforementioned challenges of technical attribution, substantiation of the attribution claims would offer the accused State an opportunity for a rebuttal and to scrutinize the evidence presented. Attribution claims substantiated by credible evidence would also facilitate dialogue between the States engaged in an exchange about the ICT incident, which is also a recommendation provided by the additional layer of understanding provided by the 2021 GGE report.[95]\nFACTS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS\nMuch of the evidence collected by socio-political and behavioural methods of inquiry into attribution⁹⁶ can be considered as circumstantial. The 2010 GGE report argued that the perpetrating party can often be established through a combination of circumstantial evidence and reasoning by inference.⁹⁷ Similar appreciation for circumstantial evidence can be found in ICJ jurisprudence. In fact, in the Corfu Channel Case, the ICJ allowed for “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”⁹⁸ given that the direct evidence of the alleged wrongdoing was only available on territory under exclusive foreign jurisdiction, preventing the injured State from pursuing effective investigation. However, in subsequent cases, the court has shown prudence when accepting circumstantial evidence and reasoning with inference.⁹⁹ To avoid erroneous, and thus potentially escalatory, claims of attribution, States should also exhibit caution when asserting attribution based on circumstantial evidence.\n## 5.3. Suggestions for operationalization\nIn light of the arguments above, implementation of the following suggestions related to the political aspect of attribution will facilitate non-escalatory attribution of ICT incidents.\na) States should decide on the format of attribution based on the desired effects of the attribution, taking into account the benefits and potential pitfalls of public and private attribution. When attribution is jointly made by a group of States, each State should critically assess the evidence before joining a declaration of attribution, just as they would in cases where attribution rests on claims reported by private enterprises. To strengthen a joint attribution, some scholars have suggested greater transparency by the involved partners.¹⁰⁰\nb) States should aim to substantiate their attribution claims, regardless of whether the cyber operation constitutes a breach of international law. This will not only facilitate the stability of international relations and the dialogue between the involved States, but would also allow the allegedly responsible State to review the evidence and possibly provide counter-arguments.\nc) Factual investigation is frequently supplemented by outcomes of socio-political attribution methods or even considered to be an alternative to computer science. In asserting attribution, States may resort to circumstantial evidence. While these considerations are not without merit, their utility remains limited as the outcomes of socio-political methods of attribution should not be the sole basis for any unfriendly reaction by the injured State. Circumstantial evidence can only serve as a supplement to evidence collected by way of technical forensic analysis. In any case, State should strive to rest the attribution claims on multiple sources of reliable and objective evidence, prioritising outcomes of technical forensic analysis, to be supplemented by circumstantial evidence.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\nd) The self-imposed standard of proof should be commensurate to the gravity of the malicious cyber operation and the planned reaction by the injured State. However, it is advisable for the State making the attribution claims to aim for the highest standard possible to avoid potential misattribution and any consequent straining of international relations.¹⁰¹ Additionally, States should continue to engage in international discussions related to the standard of proof expected in the context of attribution.\ne) States should consider resorting to various confidence-building measures and share their standards of proof with the international community. This would contribute to defining the limits of acceptable attribution practice and to the development of the customary international law.\n¹⁰¹ “[D]ifficulties must not serve as a justification to lower the bar for determinations on attribution.” Brazil in UNGA (2021b, 21).\n\n# 6. A possible international attribution mechanism?\nIn response to these challenges, several scholars and civil society organizations have proposed the establishment of a special international attribution mechanism. Such a mechanism draws inspiration from fact-finding mechanisms like those envisioned under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).[102]\nThe proposal envisions an independent and impartial body, be it ad hoc or regular, that complements sovereign attribution prerogatives. The mechanism would have investigative and assistance roles and would not amount to international arbitration. Accordingly, the mechanism should not make any claims of a breach of the primary international obligations of States or international responsibility.\nIt is envisioned that the utility of this mechanism would be attractive notably to States with less advanced attribution capabilities. The independence of the mechanism could assist with attribution upon request when a State injured by a cyber operation does not have sufficient capacity to attribute or when its attribution claims remain contested by the accused party. The conclusions of the attribution body's analysis could also be used outside the bilateral setting or by international adjudication entities when requested\nto adjudicate a conflict related to a cyber operation.[103]\nThe mandate of such a body would therefore be limited to the collection and appraisal of the technical, factual evidence; evaluation would be conducted by a multi-stakeholder body, and the process would allow for a rigorous peer review process. Additionally, transparency of the investigation process would be imperative as other investigation mechanisms, such as those of the OPCW, have been openly criticized by some States for their alleged lack of transparency,[104] have been seen as biased,[105] and their findings described as \"unreliable and technically unconvincing\".[106]\nSeveral questions surrounding the proposed mechanism remain. There may be hesitation on the part of States to allow the fact-finding body to investigate the networks or systems on their sovereign territory. There may also be limited willingness to cooperate over concerns related to national security or sovereign prerogatives.\nInternational discussions about such a mechanism appear to have been limited and relevant official State positions hardly ubiquitous. Some reservations have already been voiced.[107] This perhaps warrants additional research as well as an international debate to scrutinize the established fact-finding mechanisms and evaluate whether the potential issues can be ironed out.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS\n|  |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n# 7. Conclusion\nAttribution – the process of assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber operation – seeks to deter such operations or to legitimize the imposition of costs for the wrongdoing in order to promote accountability in international relations. Attribution is a process with several aspects – factual, legal and political. This paper reviews these three aspects in the context of the operationalization of the norm of responsible State behaviour aimed at ensuring non-escalatory attribution.^[108]^\nThese three aspects of attribution are intertwined: technical or factual investigations underpin the legal analysis and relevant political considerations. Therefore, factual attribution is a crucial element of accurate, non-escalatory attribution that facilitates stability in international relations. Legal examination of the malicious cyber operation establishes the legal responsibility of a State. Attribution in accordance with the rules and principles of the customary international law of State responsibility allows the injured State to employ reaction beyond retorsion. Political aspects of attribution take into account the outcomes of the factual and legal analyses and include decision-making related to the format of attribution and standards of proof.\nHowever, factual attribution remains challenging, which hinders attribution as a normative operation and prevents States from invoking credible State responsibility. It is\nperhaps because of this that attribution claims \"often remain contested\"^[109]^ and \"lack both transparency and verifiability\".^[110]^\nThis is not to say that questions remain only related to factual aspects of attribution. In fact, several aspects of attribution could benefit from further research and international discussions. This should include assessing the idea of an international attribution mechanism, which is envisioned to assist States with the evidence collection and analysis elements of the attribution process.\nFurther clarity is also needed in relation to the legal aspects of attribution. Further research of opinio juris and State practice can contribute to the understanding of the degree of control required by the law of State responsibility to establish a legal nexus between the de facto responsible non-State actor and the de jure responsible State in the context of cyberspace.\nMoreover, States should continue discussing and sharing the interpretation of the standards of proof deemed sufficient to attribute a cyber operation to a particular State. Although these standards are subject to political considerations, relevant international legal doctrine can provide guidance.\nFinally, further consideration of the role of the attribution claims made by non-State actors would perhaps be in order.\nUNIDIR NON-ESCALATORY ATTRIBUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CYBER INCIDENTS"
