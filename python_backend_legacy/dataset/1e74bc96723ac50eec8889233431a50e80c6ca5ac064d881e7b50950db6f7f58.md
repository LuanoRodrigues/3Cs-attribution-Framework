Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack (Holland and Pearson 2022).\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Nye 2017; Borghard and Lonergan 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baliga, De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020; Finnemore and Hollis 2020). On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023b; Williamson 2024; Pischedda and Cheon 2023). Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process (Davis 2017; Egloff 2020b; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019).\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state (Schulzke 2018; Shandler, Kostyuk, and Oppenheimer 2023). Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public (Chu and Recchia 2022). Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force (Lin-Greenberg 2021).\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks (Kostyuk and Wayne 2021), threats (Gomez and Whyte 2021), vulnerabilities (Leal and Musgrave 2023a), proxies (Williamson 2024), alliances (Guenther and Musgrave 2022), retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Jensen and Valeriano 2019). Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging (Lynn 2010; Clark and Landau 2011). Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor (Sepich 2023).\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases (Egloff 2020b). First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded (Lupovici 2014, 339; Lin 2016, 76). The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity (Rupp and Paulus 2023, 28--31).\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis (Carson 2016). However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions (Mueller et al. 2019, 111; Rupp and Paulus 2023, 17). Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community (Finnemore and Hollis 2020) and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences (Baram 2023b). States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack (Schulzke 2018).\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018). Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless (Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023a).\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations (Williamson 2024). Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses (Schulzke 2018). Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 457; Kaminska 2021, 7--8). Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs (Lindsay 2015, 5; Nye 2017, 51).\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly (Riemer and Sobelman 2023, 280). While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries (Carnegie and Carson 2019). Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence (Cormac and Aldrich 2018).\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies (Egloff 2020a). When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution (Davis 2017; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019). For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack (Graham 2018).\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations (Carnegie 2021, 226; Myrick 2024). Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs (Zaller 1992; Berinsky 2009). However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions (Chapman and Reiter 2004; Grieco et al. 2011; Hayes and Guardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018), refugee policy (Dragojlovic 2015), environmental policy (Greenhill 2020), big tech regulations (Chapman and Li 2023), treaty compliance\n(Tingley and Tomz 2022), and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Leep and Pressman 2019).\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments (Tingley and Walter 2011). Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative (Peterson and Allamong 2022; Maschmeyer et al. 2025). This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed (Fisher 2020; Carter and Carter 2021).\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions (Kertzer 2023). In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines (Guisinger and Saunders 2017; Cavari and Freedman 2019). Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices (Hayes and\nGuardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018). In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues (Dragojlovic 2015). These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty (Schulzke 2018; but see Leal and Musgrave 2023b, for a counterpoint), suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism (Wittkopf 1990; Holsti and Rosenau 1990). Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues (Herrmann et al. 1997; Castano, Bonacossa, and Gries 2016; Gomez 2019). Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations (Grieco et al. 2011). Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion (Murray 2014). Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy (Goldsmith and Horiuchi 2009). However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific (Peer et al. 2022; Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023). I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs (Leal and Musgrave 2022). All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company (Perlroth 2012). More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2021, 479--480). Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace (Davis 2017; Mueller et al. 2019). However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017), further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources (Maschmeyer et al. 2025). However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them (Peterson and Allamong 2022), while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues (Carter and Carter 2021). These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community (Leal and Musgrave 2023b). However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted.",

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack .\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified . On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict . Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process .\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state . Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public . Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force .\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks , threats , vulnerabilities , proxies , alliances , retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation . Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging . Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor . Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor .\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases . First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded . The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity .\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis . However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions . Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community  and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences . States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack .\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public . Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless .\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations . Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses . Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures . Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population . Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs .\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly . While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries . Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence .\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies . When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution . For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack .\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations . Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution . However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs . However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions , refugee policy , environmental policy , big tech regulations , treaty compliance\n, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments . Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative . This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed .\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions . In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines . Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices . In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues . These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty , suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism . Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues . Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations . Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion . Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy . However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific . I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs . All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company . More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation . However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector . Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace . However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace , further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources . However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them , while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues . These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community . However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted.",

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales. Aunque este argumento parece convincente, no ha sido examinado de manera exhaustiva. Basándose en estudios sobre señales extranjeras y opinión Pública, este artículo presenta los resultados de tres experimentos de encuesta que investigan si las narrativas contrapuestas sobre la identidad de un agresor cibernético afectan la confianza de los estadounidenses en las declaraciones públicas de atribución y su apoyo a políticas de represalia. Los resultados muestran que los respaldos por parte de aliados aumentan significativamente la confianza del público en la atribución, así como el apoyo a medidas de represalia unilaterales y multilaterales. En particular, los mensajes provenientes de aliados tienen el mayor impacto en demócratas, independientes y pacifistas.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.",
    "## Introduction": "Contested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack .\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified . On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict . Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process .\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state . Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public . Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force .\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks , threats , vulnerabilities , proxies , alliances , retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation . Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.",
    "# Confidence in Attribution": "Descriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.",
    "# Support for Retaliation": "Overall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company . More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.",
    "# Discussion": "I found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation . However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector . Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace . However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace , further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.",

    "## Notes\nThe Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance consisting of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nM.M.LEAL\n2. This survey experiment was deemed exempt from IRB review by the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n3. This scenario was based on findings indicating that Americans perceive attacks against the power grid as severe, and that, although no cyberattack has directly resulted in human deaths to date, cyber incidents involving casualties provoke stronger reactions from the US public (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2023b).\n## Acknowledgments\nPrevious versions of this paper were presented at the 2022 Cybersecurity Summer Institute at Georgia Tech, the 2023 Conflict Workshop at UC San Diego, and the APSA Annual Conference in 2021 and 2023. I am grateful to the participants and discussants at these events for their valuable feedback. I also extend my thanks to Paul Musgrave, Jane Fountain, Alasdair Roberts, and the editors and three anonymous reviewers at International Interactions for their insightful comments and suggestions.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n## Funding\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Centennial Center of the American Political Science Association and a Dissertation Completion Fellowship from the International Studies Association.\n## ORCID\nMarcelo M.

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack .\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified . On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict . Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process .\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state . Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public . Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force .\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks , threats , vulnerabilities , proxies , alliances , retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation . Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging . Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor . Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor .\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases . First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded . The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity .\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis . However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions . Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community  and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences . States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack .\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public . Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless .\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations . Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses . Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures . Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population . Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs .\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly . While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries . Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence .\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies . When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution . For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack .\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations . Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution . However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs . However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions , refugee policy , environmental policy , big tech regulations , treaty compliance\n, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments . Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative . This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed .\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions . In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines . Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices . In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues . These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty , suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism . Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues . Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations . Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion . Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy . However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific . I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs . All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company . More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation . However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector . Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace . However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace , further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources . However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them , while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues . These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community . However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted.",

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack (Holland and Pearson 2022).\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Nye 2017; Borghard and Lonergan 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baliga, De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020; Finnemore and Hollis 2020). On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023b; Williamson 2024; Pischedda and Cheon 2023). Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process (Davis 2017; Egloff 2020b; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019).\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state (Schulzke 2018; Shandler, Kostyuk, and Oppenheimer 2023). Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public (Chu and Recchia 2022). Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force (Lin-Greenberg 2021).\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks (Kostyuk and Wayne 2021), threats (Gomez and Whyte 2021), vulnerabilities (Leal and Musgrave 2023a), proxies (Williamson 2024), alliances (Guenther and Musgrave 2022), retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Jensen and Valeriano 2019). Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging (Lynn 2010; Clark and Landau 2011). Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor (Sepich 2023).\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases (Egloff 2020b). First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded (Lupovici 2014, 339; Lin 2016, 76). The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity (Rupp and Paulus 2023, 28--31).\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis (Carson 2016). However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions (Mueller et al. 2019, 111; Rupp and Paulus 2023, 17). Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community (Finnemore and Hollis 2020) and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences (Baram 2023b). States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack (Schulzke 2018).\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018). Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless (Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023a).\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations (Williamson 2024). Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses (Schulzke 2018). Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 457; Kaminska 2021, 7--8). Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs (Lindsay 2015, 5; Nye 2017, 51).\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly (Riemer and Sobelman 2023, 280). While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries (Carnegie and Carson 2019). Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence (Cormac and Aldrich 2018).\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies (Egloff 2020a). When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution (Davis 2017; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019). For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack (Graham 2018).\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations (Carnegie 2021, 226; Myrick 2024). Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs (Zaller 1992; Berinsky 2009). However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions (Chapman and Reiter 2004; Grieco et al. 2011; Hayes and Guardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018), refugee policy (Dragojlovic 2015), environmental policy (Greenhill 2020), big tech regulations (Chapman and Li 2023), treaty compliance\n(Tingley and Tomz 2022), and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Leep and Pressman 2019).\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments (Tingley and Walter 2011). Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative (Peterson and Allamong 2022; Maschmeyer et al. 2025). This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed (Fisher 2020; Carter and Carter 2021).\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions (Kertzer 2023). In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines (Guisinger and Saunders 2017; Cavari and Freedman 2019). Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices (Hayes and\nGuardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018). In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues (Dragojlovic 2015). These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty (Schulzke 2018; but see Leal and Musgrave 2023b, for a counterpoint), suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism (Wittkopf 1990; Holsti and Rosenau 1990). Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues (Herrmann et al. 1997; Castano, Bonacossa, and Gries 2016; Gomez 2019). Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations (Grieco et al. 2011). Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion (Murray 2014). Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy (Goldsmith and Horiuchi 2009). However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific (Peer et al. 2022; Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023). I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs (Leal and Musgrave 2022). All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company (Perlroth 2012). More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack.

Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2021, 479--480). Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace (Davis 2017; Mueller et al. 2019). However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017), further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources (Maschmeyer et al. 2025). However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them (Peterson and Allamong 2022), while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues (Carter and Carter 2021). These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community (Leal and Musgrave 2023b). However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted."

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack (Holland and Pearson 2022).\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Nye 2017; Borghard and Lonergan 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baliga, De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020; Finnemore and Hollis 2020). On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023b; Williamson 2024; Pischedda and Cheon 2023). Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process (Davis 2017; Egloff 2020b; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019).\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state (Schulzke 2018; Shandler, Kostyuk, and Oppenheimer 2023). Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public (Chu and Recchia 2022). Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force (Lin-Greenberg 2021).\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks (Kostyuk and Wayne 2021), threats (Gomez and Whyte 2021), vulnerabilities (Leal and Musgrave 2023a), proxies (Williamson 2024), alliances (Guenther and Musgrave 2022), retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Jensen and Valeriano 2019). Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging (Lynn 2010; Clark and Landau 2011). Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor (Sepich 2023).\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases (Egloff 2020b). First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded (Lupovici 2014, 339; Lin 2016, 76). The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity (Rupp and Paulus 2023, 28--31).\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis (Carson 2016). However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions (Mueller et al. 2019, 111; Rupp and Paulus 2023, 17). Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community (Finnemore and Hollis 2020) and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences (Baram 2023b). States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack (Schulzke 2018).\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018). Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless (Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023a).\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations (Williamson 2024). Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses (Schulzke 2018). Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 457; Kaminska 2021, 7--8). Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs (Lindsay 2015, 5; Nye 2017, 51).\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly (Riemer and Sobelman 2023, 280). While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries (Carnegie and Carson 2019). Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence (Cormac and Aldrich 2018).\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies (Egloff 2020a). When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution (Davis 2017; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019). For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack (Graham 2018).\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations (Carnegie 2021, 226; Myrick 2024). Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs (Zaller 1992; Berinsky 2009). However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions (Chapman and Reiter 2004; Grieco et al. 2011; Hayes and Guardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018), refugee policy (Dragojlovic 2015), environmental policy (Greenhill 2020), big tech regulations (Chapman and Li 2023), treaty compliance\n(Tingley and Tomz 2022), and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Leep and Pressman 2019).\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments (Tingley and Walter 2011). Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative (Peterson and Allamong 2022; Maschmeyer et al. 2025). This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed (Fisher 2020; Carter and Carter 2021).\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions (Kertzer 2023). In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines (Guisinger and Saunders 2017; Cavari and Freedman 2019). Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices (Hayes and\nGuardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018). In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues (Dragojlovic 2015). These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty (Schulzke 2018; but see Leal and Musgrave 2023b, for a counterpoint), suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism (Wittkopf 1990; Holsti and Rosenau 1990). Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues (Herrmann et al. 1997; Castano, Bonacossa, and Gries 2016; Gomez 2019). Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations (Grieco et al. 2011). Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion (Murray 2014). Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy (Goldsmith and Horiuchi 2009). However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific (Peer et al. 2022; Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023). I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs (Leal and Musgrave 2022). All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company (Perlroth 2012). More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2021, 479--480). Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace (Davis 2017; Mueller et al. 2019). However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017), further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources (Maschmeyer et al. 2025). However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them (Peterson and Allamong 2022), while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues (Carter and Carter 2021). These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community (Leal and Musgrave 2023b). However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted."

Leal\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n# ABSTRACT\nConflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.\n# RESUMEN\nSe suele pensar que las narrativas contradictorias sobre quién es responsable de un ciberataque generan incertidumbre sobre la identidad del agresor, lo que a su vez podría conducir a una mayor moderación en las respuestos estatales. Aunque este argumento parece convincente, no ha sido examinado de manera exhaustiva. Basándose en estudios sobre señales extranjeras y opinión Pública, este artículo presenta los resultados de tres experimentos de encuesta que investigan si las narrativas contrapuestas sobre la identidad de un agresor cibernético afectan la confianza de los estadounidenses en las declaraciones públicas de atribución y su apoyo a políticas de represalia. Los resultados muestran que los respaldos por parte de aliados aumentan significativamente la confianza del público en la atribución, así como el apoyo a medidas de represalia unilaterales y multilaterales.

No obstante, los efectos de las negaciones no alcanzan consistentemente niveles de significación estadística convencional en todos los experimentos. Estos hallazgos destacan el papel potencial que tanto aliados como adversarios pueden desempeñar en la formación de la opinión pública y la política de ciberseguridad a través de atribuciones públicas disputadas.\n## RÉSUMÉ\nL'on s'imagine généralement que les récits contradictoires concernant les auteurs d'une cyberattaque créent de l'incertitude quant à l'identité de l'agresseur, ce qui pourrait ensuite aboutir à un degré plus important de retenue de la part de l'État qui formule sa réponse. Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n## Introduction\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack .\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified . On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict . Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process .\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state . Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public . Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force .\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks , threats , vulnerabilities , proxies , alliances , retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation . Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging . Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor . Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor .\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases . First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded . The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity .\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis . However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions . Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community  and justify investments\nin cyber capabilities to domestic audiences . States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack .\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public . Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless .\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations . Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses . Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures . Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population . Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs .\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly . While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries . Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence .\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies . When there\nis a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution . For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack .\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations . Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution . However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs . However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions , refugee policy , environmental policy , big tech regulations , treaty compliance\n, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments . Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative . This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed .\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions . In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines . Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices . In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues . These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty , suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism . Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues . Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations . Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion . Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy . However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President\nDonald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n## Experimental Design\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific . I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by\nBarabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n## Experiment 1\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs . All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n# Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nIn terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n## Experiment 2\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.\nAfterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n### Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n# Support for Retaliation\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.\nThe right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n## Experiment 3\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company . More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n# Confidence in Attribution\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Furthermore, effect signs and significance levels were similar among ordinal logistic and logistic regressions. No treatment-by-treatment interaction effects were found.\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 7. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\nFigure 8. Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views\nof Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n### Support for Retaliation\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing\n#\nM.M.LEAL\nFigure 9. Experiment 3—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects for support for multilateral action.\nsanctions when informed that the EU or US endorsed either the Israeli or Iranian accusations. Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n# Discussion\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining\nsilent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation . However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector . Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace . However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.\nLess powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace , further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n## Conclusion\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design\nmakes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources . However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them , while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues . These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community . However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted."

States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners. For example, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian government of carrying out a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that hit Ukraine's Ministry of Defense and two\nmajor banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack .\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified . On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict . Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process .\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state . Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public . Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force .\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks , threats , vulnerabilities , proxies , alliances , retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation . Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.\nIf foreign narratives regarding the identity of a perpetrator can influence the target's audiences, these narratives may be an effective tool of statecraft. States issuing endorsements may boost the confidence in attribution claims among the domestic audiences of allied countries and their support for retribution. Endorsements from allies might be particularly valuable in situations where the credibility of domestic agencies is in question, such as in cases of foreign election interference. On the other hand, states denying responsibility for a cyberattack can negatively impact the confidence of audiences in the target state, dampening support for harsher retaliation.\nDrawing on studies about foreign cues and public opinion, this article presents the results of three survey experiments that investigate the impact of foreign narratives on the US public. Specifically, these experiments explore whether foreign endorsements and disavowals influence the confidence of US respondents in attribution claims and their willingness to retaliate to a cyberattack. Experiment 1 tests whether endorsement and disavowal messages affect the US public. Experiment 2 examines whether domestic elite consensus moderates the influence of adversaries' denials. Experiment 3 investigates whether endorsements from an ally and the US government produce similar effects when respondents evaluate a cyberattack against a third country. This experimental design facilitates the exploration of the microfoundations of cyber attribution and retaliation.\nThe results demonstrate that endorsements made by allies strongly increase confidence in public attributions. Respondents were more inclined to trust official accusations when they were informed that the European Union endorsed attribution claims. Endorsements from allies also raised public pressure to respond to cyberattacks. In particular, respondents exposed to EU endorsements were more likely to reject inaction and express support for de-escalation measures, such as diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that party identity and foreign policy orientations moderate the relationship between endorsements and the dependent variables. Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials\non the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion\n\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations.

Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments.

Bien que cet argument paraisse convaincant, il n'a pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation exhaustive. Se fondant sur une étude des indices de l'étranger et de l'opinion publique, cet article présente les résultats de trois expériences de sondage qui analysent si des récits contradictoires sur l'identité d'un cyberagresseur ont un effet sur la confiance des Américains dans les déclarations publiques d'attribution et sur leur soutien aux politiques de représailles. D'après les résultats, le soutien d'alliés renforce beaucoup la confiance de la population en matière d'attribution, ainsi que le soutien aux mesures de représailles unilatérales et multilatérales. Plus précisément, ce sont les messages d'alliés qui ont l'effet le plus important sur les démocrates, les indépendants et les colombes. Par opposition, le reniement d'adversaires réduit généralement la confiance des participants dans les accusations officielles et diminue leur propension à soutenir une réponse plus dure. Néanmoins, quand un État choisit de nier toute responsabilité dans une attaque, l'on n'atteint pas forcément des niveaux de signification statistiques conventionnels dans toutes les expériences. Ces conclusions mettent en lumière le rôle potentiel que les alliés comme les adversaires peuvent jouer quand il s'agit de façonner l'opinion publique et la politique de cybersécurité par le biais des attributions publiques polémiques.\n\n## Introduction\n\nContested public attributions have become a common phenomenon in cybersecurity politics. States often publicly accuse international adversaries of sponsoring and conducting cyber operations against their computer networks. In response, accused countries dispute these attribution claims by promoting counter-narratives. Furthermore, countries not directly involved in these cybersecurity crises often engage in these blame games by endorsing the narratives of their close international partners.

    "major banks. Russia denied any responsibility and, in turn, accused Ukraine of blaming Russia for various issues. A few days later, the United States and the United Kingdom publicly endorsed Ukraine's attribution and condemned Russian involvement in the DDoS attack (Holland and Pearson 2022).\n\nPublicly disputing the perpetrator's identity is a strategic move that states employ to influence target audiences. Target states often denounce alleged perpetrators through public channels, aiming to convince domestic audiences that retaliatory actions are justified (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Nye 2017; Borghard and Lonergan 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baliga, De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020; Finnemore and Hollis 2020). On the other hand, adversaries typically deny accusations of wrongdoing to dampen support for retribution among the target's domestic public, particularly for measures that could escalate the conflict (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023b; Williamson 2024; Pischedda and Cheon 2023). Allies endorsing public attributions join this narrative contest to mitigate credibility issues that are inherent to the attribution process (Davis 2017; Egloff 2020b; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019).\n\nScholars argue that public opinion regarding cyberattacks in general and public attribution in particular can constrain the actions of leaders in the target state (Schulzke 2018; Shandler, Kostyuk, and Oppenheimer 2023). Experimental research corroborates this argument. Recent studies demonstrate that lawmakers exposed to the public's perspectives on security issues are more likely to express opinions that align with those held by the public (Chu and Recchia 2022). Additionally, public support for the use of force against adversaries influences lawmakers' inclinations to endorse the use of force (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), as well as military officers' recommendations to use force (Lin-Greenberg 2021).\n\nAlthough research on contested public attributions reveals insights into why allies and adversaries strategically employ blaming narratives to influence the target's audiences, researchers have spent considerably less effort exploring how the public evaluates endorsements and denials of cyber attribution claims. Recent experimental research in cybersecurity has shed light on how the public perceives cyber risks (Kostyuk and Wayne 2021), threats (Gomez and Whyte 2021), vulnerabilities (Leal and Musgrave 2023a), proxies (Williamson 2024), alliances (Guenther and Musgrave 2022), retaliation (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021; Leal and Musgrave 2022; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023), and escalation (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Jensen and Valeriano 2019). Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how the public assesses competing foreign narratives about cyber attribution.",

Regarding foreign denials, the results show that disavowals made by adversaries had a negative impact on public opinion, but this effect was not statistically significant across all models. In summary, these findings underscore that the dynamics of attribution disputes go beyond mere naming and shaming and can indeed influence target audiences.\n\nThis article makes three main contributions. First, it bridges the literature on contested public attributions and foreign cues. Whilst the former has not tested if and how the public will react to foreign messages, the latter has not engaged with how foreign narrative disputes might impact public opinion. Second, this paper presents three survey experiments designed to measure the effects of allies' endorsements and rivals' denials",
    "on the public's views of cyber operations. It provides novel empirical data about how foreign endorsements and disavowals influence US public opinion. Third, this article presents new insights into how foreign voices can shape US public attitudes toward cybersecurity incidents. Understanding under which conditions foreign voices may influence the public's confidence and willingness to retaliate is crucial for policymakers, as it can inform their strategies for responding to cyberattacks and shaping public opinion.\n\n## Contested Public Attributions and Target Audiences\n\nFollowing a cyberattack, government officials are tasked with identifying the culprit. Pinpointing the ultimate actor responsible for a cyberattack is a crucial step in taking appropriate action against the malicious actor. However, the technical features of cyberspace grant these actors the means to conceal their identities, rendering the attribution process challenging (Lynn 2010; Clark and Landau 2011). Nevertheless, cyber attribution is not an insurmountable endeavor (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Advancements in cyber forensics and cyber threat intelligence over the last decade have equipped technologically advanced countries with the capabilities to identify a cyber aggressor (Sepich 2023).\n\nCyber attribution consists of two distinct phases (Egloff 2020b). First, when faced with a cyberattack from an unknown source, target states engage in a sensemaking process. This involves applying cyber forensics techniques, consuming intelligence analyses, utilizing strategic indicators, and relying on intersubjective understandings of the environment that target states are embedded (Lupovici 2014, 339; Lin 2016, 76). The second phase consists of strategically disclosing what target states learned during the first phase, thereby connecting a cyberattack to its perpetrator. It is important to note that attribution needs not be specific: states may attribute cyber operations to “sophisticated actors” without revealing additional details about the perpetrator's identity (Rupp and Paulus 2023, 28--31).\n\nIn the second phase, the target state decides whether to disclose its findings through private or public channels. Private channels are typically used to signal to the perpetrator that the target state knows who the ultimate actor responsible is without triggering fears of escalation. This form of tacit collusion reduces public pressure within the target state to retaliate against the perpetrator, expanding the bargaining space during an international crisis (Carson 2016). However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of official public attributions (Mueller et al. 2019, 111; Rupp and Paulus 2023, 17). Target states generally opt for public channels to signal norms of acceptable behavior to the international community (Finnemore and Hollis 2020) and justify investments",
    "in cyber capabilities to domestic audiences (Baram 2023b). States also publicly blame other states to validate the policy options chosen by leaders in response to a cyberattack (Schulzke 2018).\n\nOnce the target state makes a public accusation, perpetrators can respond in various ways. They may choose to remain silent, acknowledge their responsibility, or adopt blaming avoidance strategies. While non-state actors typically take credit for their cyberattacks, states rarely do so in public (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018). Instead, states accused of wrongdoing often develop counternarratives to persuade both international and domestic audiences that the accusations are baseless (Brown and Fazal 2021; Baram 2023a).\n\nDisputes over cyber attributions increase the ambiguity about the perpetrator's identity, potentially undermining the public's confidence in the target's accusations (Williamson 2024). Disputes over cyber attributions can also influence the public's preferences for unilateral and multilateral responses (Schulzke 2018). Research on foreign provocations shows that domestic audiences typically prefer escalation and are willing to impose costs on domestic leaders who choose inaction or de-escalation strategies following a foreign provocation (Clary, Lalwani, and Siddiqui 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022, Dafoe, Hatz, and Zhang 2021). Studies on cybersecurity, on the other hand, contend that attribution uncertainty may reduce public support for countermeasures (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 457; Kaminska 2021, 7--8). Recent experimental research has suggested that attribution certainty moderates the support for retribution among the US population (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Hence, if a perpetrator can convince the target's audiences that accusations are unfounded, it may alleviate public pressure for retribution. If the target's leaders choose to retaliate regardless, they may face audience and reputation costs (Lindsay 2015, 5; Nye 2017, 51).\n\nDenial narratives leverage credibility issues inherent to the attribution process to sway the public's confidence about the perpetrator's identity. When states publicly accuse an adversary, they often rely on assessments from their intelligence agencies. However, target states rarely reveal all of the data they need to identify the perpetrator because disclosing intelligence information is costly (Riemer and Sobelman 2023, 280). While revealing information could potentially enhance audiences' trust in official accusations, it may also expose sensitive details about data collection techniques to adversaries (Carnegie and Carson 2019). Without access to publicly available data, the target's audiences must place their trust in the assessments of the intelligence community. By not acknowledging accusations, perpetrators sow doubts in the target's audiences, causing confusion and undermining public confidence (Cormac and Aldrich 2018).\n\nTo mitigate the disclosure dilemma, targets may turn to endorsements from third parties, such as international allies (Egloff 2020a). When there",
    "is a lack of publicly available data to substantiate public attributions, endorsements from third parties can help mitigate credibility issues by leveraging the public's trust in more than one organization and influencing the public's mood toward cyber attribution (Davis 2017; Eichensehr 2019; Mueller et al. 2019). For instance, in 2017, Ukraine attributed the NotPetya malware, which caused substantial damage to its economy, to Russia. The Russian government denied Ukraine's accusations and contended that NotPetya had also affected its computer networks, implying that it was not in the business of self-inflicted harm. However, in 2018, member states of the Five Eyes alliance endorsed Ukraine's accusations, providing support to the claims of Russian involvement in the cyberattack (Graham 2018).\n\nAlthough the literature related to contested public attributions reveals valuable insights into how the public plays a role in decisions to publicly deny or endorse an official attribution, it falls short of revealing how the public assesses these foreign messages. Research on contested public attributions is typically built upon the literature on state secrecy and tacit collusion, which relies on untested assumptions about the public's views on covert operations (Carnegie 2021, 226; Myrick 2024). Moreover, this literature focuses on the supply side of contested cyber attributions, offering limited insights into the demand side. Nevertheless, because policymakers and experts alike believe that disputes over the identity of the perpetrator can impact the target's audiences, we need to explore which cues might influence public opinion regarding cybersecurity threats and how these cues interact with each other. For instance, prior studies have found that endorsements from independent experts boost confidence in official US accusations and support for retribution (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, these studies have not explored whether endorsements from international allies and disavowals from adversaries shape the views of the US public regarding cyber attribution.\n\n## Foreign Narratives and their Effects on Public Opinion\n\nResearch at the intersection of foreign policy and public opinion has focused mostly on the influence of domestic elites on how the public assesses foreign affairs (Zaller 1992; Berinsky 2009). However, over the past decade, several scholars have proposed that foreign cues can influence public opinion toward international affairs. Studies have demonstrated that messages from US allies and international organizations can affect how Americans perceive US interventions (Chapman and Reiter 2004; Grieco et al. 2011; Hayes and Guardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018), refugee policy (Dragojlovic 2015), environmental policy (Greenhill 2020), big tech regulations (Chapman and Li 2023), treaty compliance",
    "(Tingley and Tomz 2022), and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Leep and Pressman 2019).\n\nAlthough this literature reveals insights into the effects of cues from allies and international organizations on public opinion, it has not systematically analyzed if and under what conditions cues from adversaries shape Americans' views toward foreign issues. Conventional wisdom suggests that domestic audiences may discount messages from adversaries, but research on signaling and crisis bargaining has revealed that costly signals from US rivals can influence Americans' attitudes in international negotiations (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Even cheap talk can shape political behavior in low-information environments (Tingley and Walter 2011). Studies on foreign propaganda and disinformation have also found that adversaries can sway domestic audiences. This research has shown that individuals exposed to propaganda are more likely to agree with the rival's narrative (Peterson and Allamong 2022; Maschmeyer et al. 2025). This effect is particularly pronounced when propaganda activities focus on foreign policy issues and do not decline even when information about the messenger's identity is disclosed (Fisher 2020; Carter and Carter 2021).\n\nThe insights of this research lead to two hypotheses about the effects of foreign cues on US public opinion: H1(endorsement effect): Endorsements from allies will increase the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution. H2(denial effect): Disavowals from adversaries will decrease the public's confidence in official attribution claims and support for retribution.\n\nThese studies also show that foreign voices affect different people in different ways. This insight is consistent with research on political psychology that demonstrates how individuals interpret new information and adjust their beliefs in accordance with pre-existing dispositions (Kertzer 2023). In this paper, I focus on three dispositions that might moderate the relationship between foreign narratives and US public attitudes: party identity, foreign policy attitudes, and preexisting images of foreign countries.\n\nDespite arguments that partisan types stop at the water's edge, recent studies have shown that party identity can shape the foreign policy preferences of the US public (Kertzer, Brooks, and Brooks 2021). Foreign issues have not only become increasingly polarized along partisan lines, but also partisan cues concerning foreign issues have become more prominent, leading individuals to align their beliefs along partisan lines (Guisinger and Saunders 2017; Cavari and Freedman 2019). Scholars investigating foreign cues have consistently found that Democrats and Independents are generally more receptive to foreign voices (Hayes and",
    "Guardino 2011; Murray 2014; Guardino and Hayes 2018). In contrast, Republicans tend to discount or even oppose foreign cues (Dragojlovic 2015). These findings, together with expectations that partisanship could play a strong role in how the public perceives cyber threats when faced with attribution uncertainty (Schulzke 2018; but see Leal and Musgrave 2023b, for a counterpoint), suggest that: H3(partisan moderator):Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among Democrats and Independents.\n\nForeign policy scholars have also proposed that Americans structure their foreign policy attitudes around two distinct orientations: cooperative and militant internationalism (Wittkopf 1990; Holsti and Rosenau 1990). Individuals high in cooperative internationalism (CI) are more willing to collaborate with international actors through multilateral organizations. In contrast, those with high levels of militant internationalism (MI) are more inclined to support the use of force in international affairs. Some scholars have also explored a third dimension of foreign policy attitudes: isolationism (Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto 2017). While individuals high in CI and MI are open to engaging in the international system in distinct ways, those who score high in isolationism would rather see the United States engaging less with foreign actors and focusing on solving its own domestic problems. Experimental research has demonstrated that individuals high in CI were more likely to support the Iranian nuclear deal when exposed to costly signals from Iranian officials (Kertzer, Rathbun, and Rathbun 2020). Hence, I expect that: H4(dovish moderator): Endorsement and denial effects will be stronger among doves (i.e. individuals who score high in CI).\n\nScholars have also proposed that pre-existing images of other countries influence individuals' assessment of foreign policy issues (Herrmann et al. 1997; Castano, Bonacossa, and Gries 2016; Gomez 2019). Studies on foreign cues have shown that messages from international organizations increased support for a hypothetical US intervention in East Timor among Americans who valued these organizations (Grieco et al. 2011). Exposure to positions from European allies and the United Nations, regarded as credible actors, has also influenced US public opinion about the 2003 Iraq invasion (Murray 2014). Moreover, research on public diplomacy has revealed that pre-existing images of the United States moderate the effects of US high-level visits on foreign public opinion about US foreign policy (Goldsmith and Horiuchi 2009). However, endorsements from non-credible figures can backfire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the endorsement of the agreement to close the shared border between Canada and the United States to refugee claimants and asylum seekers by then-US President",
    "Donald Trump reduced the support for this policy in Canada (Williams, Gravelle, and Klar 2022). Therefore, I expect that:H5a(ally moderator):Endorsement effects will be stronger among individuals who have positive views of the endorsing country.H5b(enemy moderator):Denial effects will be stronger among individuals who have negative views of the denying country.\n\n## Experimental Design\n\nI fielded three online survey experiments to test these hypotheses in the fall of 2021. Survey participants were recruited via CloudResearch, an online platform that vets users on Mechanical Turk. Research has shown that CloudResearch provides higher-quality data than the base Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and student samples, as well as data quality similar to Prolific (Peer et al. 2022; Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023). I also used geographic targeting to guarantee a rough balance across US Census regions and divided the recruitment of participants by daypart, launching recruitment surveys during the day and the evening.\n\nThe survey experiment was divided into a two-wave panel to mitigate priming concerns between the first and second panels. In the first wave, respondents were asked to answer a pre-questionnaire that contained basic demographics questions (e.g. age, gender, race) and questions measuring respondents' foreign policy attitudes and pre-existing images of other countries. I also measured respondents' political knowledge in the first wave.\n\nI measured respondents' foreign policy attitudes by asking whether they agreed or disagreed with nine statements related to the US engagement in the world. Statements were replicated from Gravelle, Reifler, and Scotto (2017). Agreement levels were measured using a five-point scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) for each statement and a don't know option. Final scores were measured using factor analysis. I have imputed the mean score value to respondents with missing values. Respondents who had a final score higher than the mean score were labeled as high in a specific orientation. The remaining were labeled as low.\n\nI used feeling thermometers as a proxy to measure respondents' pre-existing images of states endorsing or denying official attribution claims. Participants were asked to answer how they would rate their feelings toward a set of ally and rival states using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from very warm to very cold. Respondents with missing values (i.e. those that chose the “don't know” option) were imputed the median value. Later, feelings were organized into three types of images: positive, neutral, and negative.\n\nTo measure respondents' political knowledge, I used four types of knowledge questions based on the temporal-topical framework proposed by",
    "Barabas et al. (2014). Questions included knowing who the US Secretary of State at the time was, which type of weapons system would be constructed in the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) security deal, which country in a set of countries do not have nuclear weapons, and which country the Camp David Accords involved besides the United States and Israel. Correct answers were summed to create a simple knowledge score.\n\nIn the second wave, respondents took the experiments. To mitigate potential concerns of priming and satisficing, the experiments were split into two modules and applied two weeks apart. A total of 3,760 respondents completed the pre-questionnaire survey. Approximately half of them, selected at random, were invited to take the experiments, of which 1,439 participants successfully completed Experiment 1 (included in Module 1) and 1,405 completed Experiments 2 and 3 (included in Module 2).\n\nAll panels and modules included instructional manipulation checks to test for respondents' attentiveness (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, and Davidenko 2009). Participants were asked to answer a generic question that included instructions about which answer respondents should mark among the multiple choices. Correct answers were summed up to create a simple attention score ranging from zero to three. In experiment 1, about fourteen percent of participants did not pass attention checks. In experiments 2 and 3, that number reached around seventeen percent. Drawing on experimental studies that show that dropping respondents who failed attention checks from the analysis might introduce bias (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014; Aronow, Baron, and Pinson 2019), I did not exclude these respondents from the main analysis.\n\nIn the following sections, I describe the vignettes and treatments of each experiment. I also present the main results for confidence in attribution and support for retribution of each experiment in two stages. First, I present average treatment effects using three linear regression models. The Base model includes only the experimental manipulations, while the Adjusted model includes the experimental manipulations, demographic controls, and technical controls (attention scores and question order). The Full model includes covariates from the Base and Adjusted models, as well as scores for foreign policy attitudes, pre-existing images, and party identity. Second, I present the results of heterogeneous effects using linear models with interaction effects between the treatments and party identity, foreign policy orientations, and pre-existing images and conducting pairwise comparisons between contrasts.\n\n## Experiment 1\n\nFor experiment 1, all respondents read a vignette that described a cyberattack against the computer network of the US Department of Defense, which",
    "#\n\nM.M.LEAL\n\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars in damages. This scenario was based on previous findings indicating that Americans are more likely to consider a cyberattack severe when it targets the US military's computer network and causes substantial economic costs (Leal and Musgrave 2022). All respondents also read that the US government accused the Chinese government of being behind the attack. After reading this information, respondents were assigned to one out of two conditions. Participants either read that European allies had not endorsed the US accusations or that European allies had endorsed US claims. Then, respondents were assigned once again to one out of three groups. The first one read that the Chinese government had denied any participation in the attack and denounced US hypocrisy because the United States also conducted cyberattacks against other countries. The second group also read a Chinese denial, this time saying that the United States had not provided any evidence that China was involved in the attack. The third group did not receive any additional information.\n\nFollowing this, all participants answered two questions. The first one asked respondents to indicate how confident they were that the Chinese government had been behind the cyberattack using a seven-point scale ranging from completely confident to completely doubtful (the scale order was randomized). The second question asked respondents to rate if they would support or not support six measures that the US government could take against China, ranging from do nothing to conduct airstrikes (the order of the measures was randomized, except for do nothing, which always appeared at the top). Figure 1 provides an overview of the experimental design.\n\n# Confidence in Attribution\n\nDescriptive data suggests that foreign endorsements shaped respondents' confidence in attribution. Confidence in US accusations against China increased by approximately forty percentage points with the endorsement of the European Union. Roughly  $88\\%$  of individuals assigned to the EU endorsement treatment and the non-denial control group expressed\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Experiment 1—Survey Design.",
    "INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n\n#\n\nconfidence in official claims, compared to approximately  $52\\%$  in the non-endorsement, non-denial group. Foreign disavowals also seem to impact respondents' views. If informed that the Chinese government denied involvement in the cyberattack and requested evidence to substantiate the US accusations, respondents were less likely to believe in the US attribution (see descriptive data in Appendix B).\n\nOrdinary least squares regressions confirm that foreign voices influenced respondents' perceptions of official attribution claims. The left-side panel in Figure 2 shows that confidence in US accusations increases by about thirty-two percentage points among respondents assigned to the EU endorsement condition  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . Respondents in the evidence-denial condition were approximately nine percentage points less likely to express confidence in official attribution  $(p &lt; 0.01)$ . Those in the hypocrisy-denial condition showed no significant difference in their beliefs regarding China's involvement in the attack when compared to respondents assigned to the control condition (i.e., no disavowal).\n\nIn Appendix E, I present additional model specifications. None of them yield substantially different results. The effect sizes and significance levels of the treatments are consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models. Results from a model that excludes non-responses are similar to those from the model with imputed values. Additionally, introducing an interaction term between the two treatment variables does not yield a significant interaction effect. Moreover, the sign directions and significance levels are comparable between the full linear model and ordered logistic or logistic regressions.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Experiment 1—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.",
    "#\n\nM.M.LEAL\n\nRegarding covariates, individuals who scored high in MI and those who hold negative views of China expressed greater confidence in US attribution claims. Republican, white, and employed participants were also more inclined to believe in the accusations of China's involvement in the cyberattack. Only individuals with low isolationism scores were less likely to believe in official statements.\n\nI have also run a series of OLS models with treatment-by-covariate interactions and conducted pairwise comparisons between contrasts to examine heterogeneity. Figure 3 demonstrates that the EU endorsement had a significant, positive impact on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans. Respondents who scored high in CI, low in MI, and low in isolationism were also significantly more likely to be moved by these reinforcing cues compared to their counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of foreign endorsements were substantially stronger among respondents with neutral views toward China, as opposed to those with either negative or positive views. I found no interaction effects between endorsements and pre-existing images of the EU. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between the denial treatments and the covariates of interest.\n\n# Support for Retaliation\n\nDescriptive analysis shows that respondents who were informed that the EU had not endorsed the US claims and read a Chinese disavowal were more inclined to choose de-escalation measures—i.e., do nothing, diplomatic condemn, or impose economic sanctions. In contrast, those assigned to the endorsement condition who were not exposed to a disavowal message were the most willing to retaliate in kind or escalate the conflict (see full descriptive data in Appendix B).\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Experiment 1—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.",
    "In terms of average treatment effects, the right-side panel in Figure 2 demonstrates that EU endorsements increase the likelihood of respondents supporting escalation or proportional responses over de-escalation by about ten percentage points (p < 0.001). On the other hand, Chinese disavowals had a negative impact on support for escalation. Both evidence and hypocrisy denials were statistically significant across all models—an effect of approximately eight percentage points (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across alternative model specifications. Effect sizes are similar in models that exclude missing values. Significance levels are comparable to those found in logistic and ordinal logistic regressions. Additionally, I did not find any treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\n\nAs for the covariates, individuals with negative views of China, positive views of the EU, or high scores in political knowledge were more inclined to support harsher retaliation measures. Women, on the other hand, were more willing to support de-escalation measures. Pairwise comparisons (see Appendix D) do not reveal significant heterogeneous effects, except for respondents with negative views of the EU, who were less likely to support retaliation in the presence of a EU endorsement, and those with high isolationism scores, who were less likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of a hypocrisy denial.\n\nI have also run a set of linear models measuring respondents' support for specific retaliation options (see Appendix C for full results). These models show that EU endorsements decreased the support for doing nothing by about seventeen percentage points (p < 0.001). Support for other countermeasures, with the exception of airstrikes, increased with the endorsement of allies. Hypocrisy denials had a negative effect on individuals' willingness to use sanctions (approximately seven percentage points, p < 0.05) and conduct cyberespionage (about eight percentage points, p < 0.01), while evidence denials reduced their willingness to use cyberattacks by around five percentage points (p < 0.05).\n\n## Experiment 2\n\nExperiment 2 measured whether foreign disavowals in the presence of domestic elite consensus would affect respondents' confidence in official attribution claims and their support for retaliation measures. In this experiment, respondents were again presented with a vignette describing a cyberattack against the US Department of Defense. However, this time, they were informed that the US government had attributed the attack to hackers associated with the Russian government. Participants also read that a resolution condemning Russia's involvement in the cyberattack had been introduced in the Senate.",
    "Afterward, respondents were divided into two groups. The first one was presented with a scenario where both Democratic and Republican senators supported the resolution, indicating elite consensus around the issue. The second group was exposed to a scenario in which Democratic lawmakers supported the resolution while Republican lawmakers opposed it, revealing partisan divisions on the topic. Then, respondents were further assigned to one out of three conditions. The control group received no additional information. The first treatment group was presented with information that the Russian government denied any involvement in the cyberattack and requested the United States to provide evidence for Russian participation. The second treatment group read that Russia denied the US accusations and accused the United States of conducting cyberattacks against Russian entities.\n\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, I measured two dependent variables in this experiment. The first variable assessed variation in respondents' confidence in official attribution claims. The second one gauged differences in participants' support for various retaliatory options. Figure 4 presents the design of Experiment 2.\n\n### Confidence in Attribution\n\nDescriptive data reveals that most respondents expressed confidence in official attribution claims across all treatment conditions. Yet, there is a 15% point gap between the most confident group—elite consensus and Russia calling out US hypocrisy—and the least one—partisan divisions and Russian requesting evidence from the US government.\n\nThe left-side panel of Figure 5 demonstrates that participants assigned to the bipartisan endorsement condition were about seven percentage points more likely to be confident in attribution claims (p < 0.01). This result supports expectations that domestic elite consensus would increase respondents' confidence in official accusations. Hypocrisy denials had a positive effect, while evidence denials had a negative effect on confidence levels. However, these effects did not reach conventional statistical",

Experiment 2—Ordinary least squares models estimating average treatment effects on confidence in attribution and support for retribution.\n\nsignificance levels across all models. Effect sizes and significance levels are comparable to those found in models that excluded missing values, as well as logistic models. Ordinal logistic models yield significant effects across the base, adjusted, and full models for evidence denials. Most importantly, I did not find any interaction effects between the treatments, suggesting that elite consensus does not have a substantial dampening effect on adversaries' denials.\n\nAs for the covariates, Democrats, respondents who scored high in CI or MI, and those holding negative views of Russia were more inclined to express confidence in US accusations. In contrast, respondents who scored high in isolationism were more likely to exhibit doubt. Pairwise comparison did not yield any significant moderation effects.\n\n# Support for Retaliation\n\nOverall, the majority of respondents showed a preference for de-escalation over other countermeasures. Descriptive data indicates that individuals in the partisan endorsement and evidence denial conditions leaned more towards de-escalation, while those in the bipartisan endorsement and no denial conditions favored more proportional or escalatory responses. When examining specific retaliatory measures, the do-nothing option had the most substantial variation among treatment groups. Over a quarter of respondents in the partisan and evidence conditions supported taking no action, but this percentage decreased to roughly one in ten in the bipartisan and no disavowal conditions.",
    "The right side of Figure 5 shows that bipartisan endorsements had a small effect on respondents' support for harsher retaliation: approximately five percentage points (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, this effect was not significant across all model specifications. Foreign disavowals consistently exerted a negative effect. Evidence denials reduced support for proportional responses and escalation by roughly seven percentage points (p < 0.05) in the adjusted and full models, but this effect did not reach conventional statistical significance levels in the base model—neither did hypocrisy denials across all models. Results for specific retaliation measures show that evidence denials made respondents more likely to support taking no action, while bipartisan endorsements had the opposite effect. Once again, I have not found treatment-by-treatment interaction effects.\n\nCompared to the baseline, only a few covariates reached statistical significance. Respondents with negative views toward Russia and high scores of political knowledge, as well those who scored high in militant internationalism, were more likely to support harsher retaliation measures. Once again, women were more likely to support de-escalation. Treatment-by-covariate interactions did not reveal significant effects for any moderator.\n\n## Experiment 3\n\nExperiment 3 investigates whether respondents evaluate endorsements from allies differently when the United States is not directly involved. Governments with advanced attribution capabilities, often located in the Global North, have endorsed cyber-related accusations made by third-party countries, even when the incidents fall outside their own jurisdictions. For instance, in 2012, the US intelligence community accused the Iranian government of being behind the Shamoon malware that disrupted the operations of Aramco, a state-owned Saudi oil company (Perlroth 2012). More recently, the United States and European countries endorsed Ukraine's accusations against Russia for cyber operations that occurred prior to the 2022 Russian invasion (U.S. Department of State 2022).\n\nIn this experiment, respondents read a vignette describing a cybersecurity incident involving a US ally (Israel) and a US rival (Iran). Half of the respondents were informed that a major city in Israel experienced a cyberattack on its power grid, resulting in a prolonged power outage and the deaths of several elderly residents due to overheating. These respondents were also made aware that the Israeli government blamed Iran for the cyberattack, while the Iranian government denied any involvement. The other half of the respondents read the same vignette but with the roles reversed: Iran accused Israel of launching a cyberattack on its electrical grid, while the Israeli government denied any connection to the incident. Respondents were then assigned to one out of three groups. The first group received no additional information. The second",
    "INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n\n#\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 6. Experiment 3—Survey Design.\n\none was informed that the US government had issued a statement condemning the actions of the alleged perpetrator. The third group read that the European Union had released a statement.\n\nAfter reading the vignette, respondents were once again prompted to rate their confidence in the attribution claims of either Israel or Iran. They were also asked to indicate whether they would support various measures by the target state in response to the cyberattack. Furthermore, respondents were asked to express their support for four multilateral measures that the United Nations Security Council could take in reaction to the attack. These options ranged from taking no action to authorizing the use of force against the aggressor, with intermediate options including condemning or authorizing sanctions against Israel or Iran. Figure 6 provides an overview of the design for Experiment 3.\n\n# Confidence in Attribution\n\nDescriptive data shows that the vast majority of respondents in the no endorsement condition were skeptical of both Iranian and Israeli accusations. However, EU and US endorsements increased respondents' confidence in these attributions.\n\nThe results of distinct ordinary least squares models confirm that EU and US endorsements, as well as Israeli accusations, had a strong positive effect on respondents' confidence. The left-side panel on Figure 7 reveals that either an EU or US endorsement boosted confidence in attribution claims by approximately fifteen percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.001)$  when compared to the no endorsement condition in the full model. Israeli accusations also had a significant positive effect on confidence levels (about twelve percentage points,  $p &lt; 0.001$ ). Effect sizes and significance levels remained consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values.

Experiment 3—Pairwise comparison between contrasts for confidence in attribution. Non-focal variables are held constant at their reference levels.\n\nConfidence in official attributions was higher among respondents who scored high in MI in contrast to those who scored low, and among those holding either positive or negative views of Israel compared to those with neutral views. Models that include treatment-by-covariates interaction terms (see Figure 8) revealed that EU endorsements had a significant, positive effect on Democrats and Independents compared to Republicans, as well as on respondents with high CI scores. In comparison, US endorsements did not demonstrate any meaningful conditional average treatment effects of interest. Israeli accusations were more likely to increase the confidence of Republicans, respondents who scored low in CI, high in MI, those holding negative views",
    "of Iran (compared to those holding neutral feelings), and those with positive views of Israel. Conversely, individuals with negative views of Israel were substantially less likely to express confidence in Israeli accusations compared to Iranian ones.\n\n### Support for Retaliation\n\nDescriptive data indicates that respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of de-escalation (see Appendix B). That said, the right-side panel of Figure 7 shows that respondents were more likely to climb the escalation ladder and support harsher retaliation when Israel accused Iran—about fifteen percentage points (p < 0.001). EU and US endorsements also boosted support for escalation (four and six percentage points, respectively), but only US endorsements achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01). These results remain consistent across the base, adjusted, and full models, as well as in models that excluded missing values. Logistic regressions produce results in line with the main model, while in ordinal logistic models EU endorsements produced a positive, statistical significant effect. Results show no treatment-by-treatment interaction effect.\n\nWhile EU messages did not significantly affect respondents' support for harsher retaliation, results demonstrate that EU endorsements do impact individuals' support for specific countermeasures. In Appendix C, I show that respondents were more inclined to oppose inaction and support diplomatic condemnation or economic sanctions when exposed to EU statements. US endorsements also increased respondents' willingness to support these countermeasures in addition to conducting cyberespionage. Launching cyberattacks against the perpetrator's power grid or government, was more likely only among those who read an Israeli accusation instead of an Iranian one.\n\nIn terms of heterogeneous effects, results show that individuals holding neutral views of Israel (compared to those with positive views) were more likely to support harsher retaliation in the presence of EU endorsements. US endorsements substantially increased support for retribution among those with neutral and negative feelings toward Israel. Israeli accusations had a stronger positive effect among Republicans, those with high MI and low isolationism scores, and respondents holding positive views of Israel and negative views of Iran.\n\nGiven that respondents might be more inclined to escalate a cyber conflict in which the United States was not directly involved, I asked whether individuals would support four multilateral actions that the United Nations Security Council could adopt in response to the cyberattack. Figure 9 shows that participants were significantly more likely to reject UNSC inaction and support resolutions condemning the attack or imposing",

Neither endorsement, however, increased the support for international intervention according to conventional statistical significance levels. In the other hand, Israeli accusations made respondents more willing to support UNSC action, including using force.\n\n# Discussion\n\nI found consistent evidence that foreign endorsements of official attribution claims significantly increase respondents' confidence in these claims. Experiment 1 showed that endorsements from the European Union increase confidence levels, while Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of EU statements are comparable to those issued by the US government. Additionally, the results demonstrate that foreign endorsements affect respondents' preferences for retribution. EU endorsements increased the support for unilateral retaliation in Experiment 1 and support for multilateral action short of military intervention in Experiment 3. When looking at support for specific unilateral countermeasures, participants were more likely to back up all unilateral actions, with the exception of airtrikes, when the EU endorsed official attributions in Experiment 1. In experiment 3, EU statements decreased support for doing nothing and increased support for condemnation and sanctions. The public's preferences for multilateral responses yielded similar results. Together, these results give support to H1 (endorsement effect).\n\nRegarding foreign disavowals, I found mixed evidence that they influence respondents' confidence in attribution claims. In Experiment 1, denials that cast doubt on the evidence held by the US government decreased confidence in US attribution claims. However, this effect did not reach statistical significance across all model specifications in Experiment 2. Furthermore, in no experiment did denying responsibility and accusing the United States of hypocrisy make a difference compared to remaining",
    "silent. When it comes to respondents' willingness to support harsher retaliation, the results show that denials requesting evidence had a negative impact in Experiments 1 and 2. Still, only Experiment 1 reached conventional significance levels across the base, adjusted, and full models. Denials calling out US hypocrisy, on the other hand, were statistically significant in experiment 1 but not in experiment 2. These results are too ambiguous to either reject or fail to reject H2 (denial effect), raising questions about the dampening effects of plausible deniability on the public's pressure for harsher retaliation in target states.\n\nLastly, the evidence that moderators influence the causal relation between foreign cues and the variables of interest is weak. Across experiments, Democrats, Independents, and doves (i.e. individuals high in CI) were more likely to be confident in attribution claims when exposed to EU endorsements. Nonetheless, party identity and high CI scores did not systematically moderate the effects of rivals' disavowals. These results give mixed support to H3 (partisan moderator) and H4 (dovish moderator). Regarding pre-existing images, respondents holding neutral views of China and Israel were somewhat more responsive to EU endorsement in Experiments 1 and 3, respectively. However, pre-existing images had no significant moderating effect across the board. Therefore, H5a (ally moderator) and H5b (enemy moderator) did not receive support.\n\nThese findings offer promising news for target states that choose to publicly accuse another state following a cyberattack. In a competitive information environment, denials from adversaries can undermine the credibility of official attributions. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that states can bolster the credibility of their attributions by seeking endorsements from allies. Similarly, target states can leverage private sector investigations, as studies have shown that independent experts' endorsements also increase confidence in attribution and support for retaliation (Leal and Musgrave 2023b, 2022). However, because cybersecurity companies typically have access only to publicly available data, governments may need to disclose more sensitive information than they would prefer to the private sector (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2021, 479--480). Proposals to establish a standardized attribution process under international law or to create an international organization responsible for attributing cyberattacks could also improve accountability in cyberspace (Davis 2017; Mueller et al. 2019). However, these proposals may face resistance from sovereignty-conscious states (Kuehn, Decker, and Rauhut 2023, 4; Tsagourias and Farrell 2020, 960). Due to the risks associated with sharing sensitive information with non-governmental organizations and the opposition to relinquishing authority to international bodies, the most practical solution for states may be informal coalitions of like-minded states for co-attributing a cyberattack.",
    "Less powerful states, which often lack the cyber capabilities to attribute an intrusion or attack to another state, can benefit from investigations conducted by more capable countries. The latter can assist the former by sharing information and assisting in identifying the perpetrator. When a less capable state makes an attribution, endorsements from more powerful allies can lend credibility to their claims. Since smaller states typically are not under the radar of leading cybersecurity firms and may not afford their high fees, collaborating with allies to jointly attribute a cyberattack can be an effective strategy when responding to a cyberattack.\n\nFor those attempting to deflect blame, there is both good and bad news. On the one hand, denial narratives may pay off in a competitive information environment, as they provide a low-cost strategy to counter accusations. However, the findings indicate that the effectiveness of plausible deniability is limited. As more states endorse a particular accusation, the credibility of the official attribution will also increase, which could nullify the impact of rivals' denials. Furthermore, it is plausible to expect that when multiple states co-attribute a cyberattack to a malicious actor, a public denial may backfire, as it risks being perceived as hypocritical and insincere, provoking a negative response. This suggests that coordinated attributions could serve as a significant deterrent—not only because of the reputational costs associated with naming and shaming but also due to fears that the public's pressure for harsher retaliation will grow as the certainty behind the aggressor's identity increases. Nonetheless, given studies indicating that deterrence has often failed in cyberspace (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017), further studies are needed to assess the deterrent effects of allies' endorsements.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper empirically tests how foreign messages about public cyber attributions influence perceptions and preferences of the US public toward cyber operations. I found that foreign endorsements of allies have a significant impact on respondents' confidence in attribution claims and shape their support for retaliation measures. In contrast, results demonstrate that the effects of foreign disavowals issued by rival nations have a limited influence on US public opinion.\n\nWhile these findings advance our understanding of how and when foreign voices might affect the US public's confidence in attribution and support for retribution, this study is not without limitations. First, like much of the existing research in cybersecurity, it focuses on US public reactions. This raises questions about the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Replicating the study in diverse political environments could provide valuable insights into whether responses to competing public attributions vary across different settings. Second, the experimental design",
    "makes it challenging to determine whether respondents choose a specific policy solely due to foreign narratives or because they have substantive different assumptions about the policy options they select. Future research could further investigate this issue.\n\nAnother limitation is that the study does not explore how individuals get exposed to these contested attributions in the first place. It is plausible that the platform through which information is consumed affects individuals' willingness to believe it. For example, research suggests that individuals are more likely to agree with foreign narratives when exposed to them through traditional media rather than social networks, possibly due to the perceived credibility and reputation of traditional media sources (Maschmeyer et al. 2025). However, studies on exposure to traditional media online raise questions about the true mechanism of this influence. Some research shows that individuals who are exposed to unfamiliar media sources are likely to agree with them (Peterson and Allamong 2022), while others find that even untrustworthy media platforms can shape American preferences on foreign policy issues, though not on domestic issues (Carter and Carter 2021). These studies suggest a promising direction for expanding this research by examining how different platforms mediate the effects of contested public attributions.\n\nScholars can also expand upon these findings in future works. First, scholars could investigate how distinct denial narratives impact the public. Besides accusations of hypocrisy and of unfounded attribution, US rivals have also deflected blame onto other actors, criticized the attributing state for bias, and pledged to uphold international norms of non-aggression (Hansson, Madisson, and Ventsel 2023). Even though all disavowals are cheap talk, they convey distinct narratives that may affect different segments of the public in varying ways. A fruitful way forward might involve examining which emotions these stories evoke and how these emotions mediate the public's preferences. Second, researchers could explore how attributions and endorsements from private companies influence public opinion (Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021). Cybersecurity companies, particularly those specializing in cyber threat intelligence, have been active in producing reports and tracing hacks back to foreign entities. Previous studies have shown that the endorsement of private companies bolsters public confidence in attributions made by the US intelligence community (Leal and Musgrave 2023b). However, the question of how these endorsements would fare in a more competitive information environment has not been thoroughly examined. Further research in these directions is warranted.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance consisting of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting narratives about who is responsible for a cyberattack are often thought to create uncertainty about the aggressor's identity, which in turn could lead to greater restraint in state responses. Although this argument seems compelling, it has not been thoroughly tested. Building on studies of foreign cues and public opinion, this paper presents results from three survey experiments that investigate whether competing narratives about the identity of a cyber aggressor affect Americans' confidence in public attribution claims and support for retribution policies. The results show that endorsements from allies significantly boost the public's confidence in attribution, as well as increase support for unilateral and multilateral retaliation measures. In particular, messages from allies have the strongest impact on Democrats, Independents, and doves. In contrast, disavowals from adversaries generally reduce respondents' confidence in official accusations and diminish their willingness to back retaliation. Nonetheless, denial effects do not consistently reach conventional statistical significance levels across all experiments. These findings highlight the potential role that both allies and adversaries can play in shaping public opinion and cybersecurity policy through contested public attributions.",
