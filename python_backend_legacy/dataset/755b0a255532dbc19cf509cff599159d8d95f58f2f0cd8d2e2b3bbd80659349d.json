These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections (Broeders et al. 2022; Brattberg and Maurer 2018). After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence (Willett 2021). Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers (Wu 2023). In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies (Willet, 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\n\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh (Jun 2022). More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents (Willett 2021; Broeders et al. 2022; Pernik 2018).\n\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\n\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report (Hurel 2023).\n\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal'\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\n\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM\n\nThe relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes (Nye 2014; Nye 2017; Nye 2018; Taddeo 2018). In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace (Broeders et al. 2022) The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised (Broeders 2021).\n\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace” (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE) (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 366).\n\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 24). The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states (Nye 2018, 5-6). Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\n\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information (Polyakova and Meserole 2019, 1-3; Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759).\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013)\n\nThe first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states. (Taddeo and Floridi 2018; Nye 2018, 9). In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures (Henriksen 2019, 2).\n\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare (Henriksen 2019, 2). The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\n\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions (Pernik 2018, 54-56).\n\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations (Pernik 2018, 59-60). However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz (Broeders et al. 2022, 100).\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\n\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties (Nakashima 2013; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco (Buchanan 2020, 148-151). The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\n\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other \"confidential business information\" (Segal 2016; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks (Segal 2016). Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms (Segal 2016).\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

The fourth group and the 2015 report\n\nIn 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age (Henriksen 2019, 3). The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 6). The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year (Nye 2018, 9). The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace (Goldman 2023, 157). The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm (Henriksen 2019, 3). Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 115). The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs (Henriksen 2019, 3).\n\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017)\n\nThe fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297). However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297).\n\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states,\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means (Broeders et al. 2022, 112; Brattberg and Maurer, 2018). The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign (Broeders et al. 2022, 113). Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections (Brattberg and Maurer 2018, 3). One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018). In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018).\n\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 108).\n\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies (Broeders et al. 2022, 117; Pernik 2018, 61-62).\n\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations.

It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group (Christensen and Liebetrau 2019).\n\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021)\n\nThe sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021 6). Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 8).\n\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well (Willett 2021, 7-9; Broeders et al. 2022, 107).\n\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025)\n\nThe first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021 (Pytlak 2023). The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms (Broeders et al. 2022, 115; Goldman, 2023, 157).\n\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025 (Pytlak 2023). In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report (Hurel 2023). The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress (Hurel 2023; Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity (Hurel 2023). Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\n\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks (Hurel 2023). Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Hurel 2023).\n\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory.

Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document (Pytlak 2023).\n\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES\n\n## 4.1. The current cyber landscape\n\nMicrosoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\n\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks (Microsoft 2023, 46). However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives (Microsoft 2023, 3).\n\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations (Whyte 2023, 309). There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system (Whyte 2023, 313). Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals (Benson 2023). More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South (Madung 2023).\n\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Contending positions\n\nAt the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security (Pytlak 2023). At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms (Hurel 2023). Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures (Pytlak 2023).\n\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective (Pytlak 2023).\n\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression.

The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\n\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Weber 2023).\n\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023).\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759). Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule (Henriksen 2019, 5).\n\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758). For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts (Perez 2023, 198). The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\n\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned (O'Shaughnessy 2023). In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status (Milmo 2023). Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition (Milmo 2023).\n\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported\n\nContinuity and Change in European Governance",

Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices (Feldstein 2020).\n\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology (Feldstein 2020; Wang 2021).\n\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states (Henriksen 2019, 5; Feldstein 2020).\n\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy\n\nCyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761).

Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability (Goldman 2023, 155). Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity (Henriksen 2019, 2). Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\n\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions (Moret and Pawlak 2017). Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761).\n\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks (Goldman 2023, 155). Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China (Matishak 2023).

Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\n\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism.

A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship (Ling 2023).\n\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world (Sanger and Barnes 2023). These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\n\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention (Henriksen 2019, 7).

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## Keywords\nCybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nThe US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections (Broeders et al. 2022; Brattberg and Maurer 2018). After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence (Willett 2021). Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers (Wu 2023). In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies (Willet, 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh (Jun 2022). More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents (Willett 2021; Broeders et al. 2022; Pernik 2018).\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report (Hurel 2023).\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal'\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ndemocracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM\nThe relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nthe expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes (Nye 2014; Nye 2017; Nye 2018; Taddeo 2018). In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace (Broeders et al. 2022) The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised (Broeders 2021).\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace” (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE) (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 366).\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 24). The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states (Nye 2018, 5-6). Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\" (2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 9). Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information (Polyakova and Meserole 2019, 1-3; Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n# 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES\n## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013)\nThe first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states. (Taddeo and Floridi 2018; Nye 2018, 9). In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures (Henriksen 2019, 2).\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare (Henriksen 2019, 2). The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions (Pernik 2018, 54-56).\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations (Pernik 2018, 59-60). However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz (Broeders et al. 2022, 100).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nIn 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties (Nakashima 2013; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco (Buchanan 2020, 148-151). The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other \"confidential business information\" (Segal 2016; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks (Segal 2016). Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms (Segal 2016).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report\nIn 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age (Henriksen 2019, 3). The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 6). The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year (Nye 2018, 9). The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace (Goldman 2023, 157). The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm (Henriksen 2019, 3). Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 115). The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs (Henriksen 2019, 3).\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017)\nThe fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297). However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297).\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states,\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nwhilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means (Broeders et al. 2022, 112; Brattberg and Maurer, 2018). The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign (Broeders et al. 2022, 113). Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections (Brattberg and Maurer 2018, 3). One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018). In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018).\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 108).\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies (Broeders et al. 2022, 117; Pernik 2018, 61-62).\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state-\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group (Christensen and Liebetrau 2019).\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021)\nThe sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021 6). Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 8).\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nExchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well (Willett 2021, 7-9; Broeders et al. 2022, 107).\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025)\nThe first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021 (Pytlak 2023). The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms (Broeders et al. 2022, 115; Goldman, 2023, 157).\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025 (Pytlak 2023). In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report (Hurel 2023). The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress (Hurel 2023; Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity (Hurel 2023). Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks (Hurel 2023). Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Hurel 2023).\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nproliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document (Pytlak 2023).\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES\n## 4.1. The current cyber landscape\nMicrosoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks (Microsoft 2023, 46). However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nphysical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives (Microsoft 2023, 3).\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations (Whyte 2023, 309). There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system (Whyte 2023, 313). Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals (Benson 2023). More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South (Madung 2023).\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncould also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions\nAt the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security (Pytlak 2023). At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms (Hurel 2023). Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures (Pytlak 2023).\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective (Pytlak 2023).\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsuppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Weber 2023).\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nAuthoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties (Goldman 2023, 154). Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759). Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule (Henriksen 2019, 5).\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758). For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts (Perez 2023, 198). The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned (O'Shaughnessy 2023). In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status (Milmo 2023). Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition (Milmo 2023).\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\naround the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices (Feldstein 2020).\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology (Feldstein 2020; Wang 2021).\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states (Henriksen 2019, 5; Feldstein 2020).\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy\nCyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761). UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability (Goldman 2023, 155). Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity (Henriksen 2019, 2). Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions (Moret and Pawlak 2017). Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761).\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks (Goldman 2023, 155). Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China (Matishak 2023). Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\npursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS\nThe 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nnot exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship (Ling 2023).\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world (Sanger and Barnes 2023). These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention (Henriksen 2019, 7). Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ninfrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well.",

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## Keywords Cybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION The US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections. After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence. Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers. In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies. Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh. More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents.\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report.\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal' Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 democracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM The relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature. It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 the expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes. In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised.\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace”. Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on.\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace. The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states. Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\"(2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives. Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 # 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES ## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013) The first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states.. In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures.\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare. The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace.\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions.\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations. However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 In 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide. Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building.\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties. In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco. The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other\"confidential business information\". Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks. Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report In 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age. The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity. The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year. The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm. Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure. The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs.\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017) The fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft. Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace. However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace.\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states, Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 whilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means. The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign. Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections. One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns. In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns.\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies.\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state- Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 sponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group.\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021) The sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG. Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries.\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Exchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well.\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025) The first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021. The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms.\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025. In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report. The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress. One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity. Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms. The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks. Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 proliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document.\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES ## 4.1. The current cyber landscape Microsoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks. However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 physical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives.\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations. There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system. Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals. More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South.\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 could also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions At the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention. Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security. At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states. However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms. Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures.\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective.\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 suppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations. Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Authoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties. Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments. Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule.\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet. For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts. The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position. Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned. In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status. Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition.\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 around the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices.\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology.\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states.\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy Cyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation. UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 cyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence. Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability. Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines. Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity. Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours. They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions. Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm.\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks. Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate. For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China. Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 pursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology. Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS The 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 not exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship.\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world. These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention. Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 infrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well.",

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## Keywords Cybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION The US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections. After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence. Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers. In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies. Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh. More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents.\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report.\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal' Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 democracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM The relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature. It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 the expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes. In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised.\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace”. Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on.\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace. The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states. Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\"(2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives. Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 # 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES ## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013) The first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states.. In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures.\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare. The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace.\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions.\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations. However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 In 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide. Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building.\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties. In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco. The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other\"confidential business information\". Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks. Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report In 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age. The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity. The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year. The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm. Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure. The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs.\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017) The fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft. Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace. However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace.\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states, Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 whilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means. The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign. Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections. One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns. In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns.\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies.\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state- Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 sponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group.\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021) The sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG. Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries.\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Exchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well.\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025) The first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021. The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms.\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025. In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report. The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress. One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity. Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms. The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks. Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 proliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document.\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES ## 4.1. The current cyber landscape Microsoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks. However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 physical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives.\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations. There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system. Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals. More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South.\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 could also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions At the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention. Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security. At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states. However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms. Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures.\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective.\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 suppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations. Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Authoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties. Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments. Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule.\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet. For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts. The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position. Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned. In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status. Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition.\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 around the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices.\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology.\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states.\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy Cyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation. UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 cyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence. Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability. Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines. Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity. Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours. They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions. Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm.\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks. Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate. For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China. Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 pursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology. Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS The 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 not exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship.\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world. These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention. Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 infrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well.",

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## Keywords\nCybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nThe US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections (Broeders et al. 2022; Brattberg and Maurer 2018). After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence (Willett 2021). Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers (Wu 2023). In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies (Willet, 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh (Jun 2022). More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents (Willett 2021; Broeders et al. 2022; Pernik 2018).\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report (Hurel 2023).\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal'\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ndemocracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM\nThe relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nthe expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes (Nye 2014; Nye 2017; Nye 2018; Taddeo 2018). In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace (Broeders et al. 2022) The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised (Broeders 2021).\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace” (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE) (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 366).\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 24). The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states (Nye 2018, 5-6). Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\" (2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 9). Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information (Polyakova and Meserole 2019, 1-3; Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n# 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES\n## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013)\nThe first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states. (Taddeo and Floridi 2018; Nye 2018, 9). In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures (Henriksen 2019, 2).\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare (Henriksen 2019, 2). The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions (Pernik 2018, 54-56).\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations (Pernik 2018, 59-60). However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz (Broeders et al. 2022, 100).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nIn 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties (Nakashima 2013; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco (Buchanan 2020, 148-151). The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other \"confidential business information\" (Segal 2016; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks (Segal 2016). Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms (Segal 2016).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report\nIn 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age (Henriksen 2019, 3). The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 6). The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year (Nye 2018, 9). The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace (Goldman 2023, 157). The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm (Henriksen 2019, 3). Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 115). The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs (Henriksen 2019, 3).\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017)\nThe fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297). However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297).\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states,\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nwhilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means (Broeders et al. 2022, 112; Brattberg and Maurer, 2018). The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign (Broeders et al. 2022, 113). Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections (Brattberg and Maurer 2018, 3). One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018). In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018).\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 108).\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies (Broeders et al. 2022, 117; Pernik 2018, 61-62).\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state-\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group (Christensen and Liebetrau 2019).\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021)\nThe sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021 6). Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 8).\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nExchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well (Willett 2021, 7-9; Broeders et al. 2022, 107).\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025)\nThe first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021 (Pytlak 2023). The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms (Broeders et al. 2022, 115; Goldman, 2023, 157).\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025 (Pytlak 2023). In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report (Hurel 2023). The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress (Hurel 2023; Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity (Hurel 2023). Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks (Hurel 2023). Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Hurel 2023).\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nproliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document (Pytlak 2023).\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES\n## 4.1. The current cyber landscape\nMicrosoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks (Microsoft 2023, 46). However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nphysical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives (Microsoft 2023, 3).\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations (Whyte 2023, 309). There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system (Whyte 2023, 313). Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals (Benson 2023). More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South (Madung 2023).\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncould also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions\nAt the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security (Pytlak 2023). At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms (Hurel 2023). Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures (Pytlak 2023).\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective (Pytlak 2023).\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsuppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Weber 2023).\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nAuthoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties (Goldman 2023, 154). Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759). Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule (Henriksen 2019, 5).\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758). For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts (Perez 2023, 198). The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned (O'Shaughnessy 2023). In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status (Milmo 2023). Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition (Milmo 2023).\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\naround the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices (Feldstein 2020).\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology (Feldstein 2020; Wang 2021).\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states (Henriksen 2019, 5; Feldstein 2020).\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy\nCyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761). UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability (Goldman 2023, 155). Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity (Henriksen 2019, 2). Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions (Moret and Pawlak 2017). Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761).\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks (Goldman 2023, 155). Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China (Matishak 2023). Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\npursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS\nThe 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nnot exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship (Ling 2023).\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world (Sanger and Barnes 2023). These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention (Henriksen 2019, 7). Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ninfrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well."

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## Keywords\nCybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nThe US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections (Broeders et al. 2022; Brattberg and Maurer 2018). After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence (Willett 2021). Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers (Wu 2023). In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies (Willet, 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh (Jun 2022). More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents (Willett 2021; Broeders et al. 2022; Pernik 2018).\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report (Hurel 2023).\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal'\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ndemocracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM\nThe relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nthe expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes (Nye 2014; Nye 2017; Nye 2018; Taddeo 2018). In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace (Broeders et al. 2022) The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised (Broeders 2021).\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace” (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE) (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 355). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on (Barrinha and Renard 2017, 366).\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 24). The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states (Nye 2018, 5-6). Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\" (2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives (Valeriano and Maness 2015, 9). Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information (Polyakova and Meserole 2019, 1-3; Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n# 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES\n## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013)\nThe first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states. (Taddeo and Floridi 2018; Nye 2018, 9). In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures (Henriksen 2019, 2).\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare (Henriksen 2019, 2). The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions (Pernik 2018, 54-56).\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations (Pernik 2018, 59-60). However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz (Broeders et al. 2022, 100).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nIn 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 5).\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties (Nakashima 2013; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco (Buchanan 2020, 148-151). The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other \"confidential business information\" (Segal 2016; Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021). Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks (Segal 2016). Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms (Segal 2016).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\n## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report\nIn 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age (Henriksen 2019, 3). The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 6). The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year (Nye 2018, 9). The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace (Goldman 2023, 157). The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm (Henriksen 2019, 3). Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 115). The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs (Henriksen 2019, 3).\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017)\nThe fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft (Henriksen 2019, 3). Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297). However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace (Taddeo and Floridi 2018, 297).\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states,\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nwhilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means (Broeders et al. 2022, 112; Brattberg and Maurer, 2018). The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign (Broeders et al. 2022, 113). Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections (Brattberg and Maurer 2018, 3). One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018). In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns (Brattberg and Maurer 2018).\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure (Broeders et al. 2022, 108).\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies (Broeders et al. 2022, 117; Pernik 2018, 61-62).\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state-\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group (Christensen and Liebetrau 2019).\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021)\nThe sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021 6). Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries (Tiirmaa-Klaar 2021, 8).\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nExchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well (Willett 2021, 7-9; Broeders et al. 2022, 107).\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025)\nThe first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021 (Pytlak 2023). The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms (Broeders et al. 2022, 115; Goldman, 2023, 157).\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025 (Pytlak 2023). In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report (Hurel 2023). The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress (Hurel 2023; Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity (Hurel 2023). Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks (Hurel 2023). Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Hurel 2023).\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nproliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document (Pytlak 2023).\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES\n## 4.1. The current cyber landscape\nMicrosoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks (Microsoft 2023, 46). However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nphysical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives (Microsoft 2023, 3).\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations (Whyte 2023, 309). There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system (Whyte 2023, 313). Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals (Benson 2023). More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South (Madung 2023).\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncould also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions\nAt the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security (Pytlak 2023). At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms (Hurel 2023). Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures (Pytlak 2023).\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective (Pytlak 2023).\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nsuppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Weber 2023).\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023).\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nAuthoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties (Goldman 2023, 154). Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758-759). Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule (Henriksen 2019, 5).\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 758). For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts (Perez 2023, 198). The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned (O'Shaughnessy 2023). In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status (Milmo 2023). Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition (Milmo 2023).\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\naround the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices (Feldstein 2020).\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology (Feldstein 2020; Wang 2021).\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states (Henriksen 2019, 5; Feldstein 2020).\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy\nCyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761). UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ncyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability (Goldman 2023, 155). Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines (Taddeo and Floridi 2017, 298). Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity (Henriksen 2019, 2). Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions (Moret and Pawlak 2017). Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm (Barrinha and Renard 2020, 761).\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks (Goldman 2023, 155). Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China (Matishak 2023). Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\npursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology (Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023). Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS\nThe 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\nnot exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship (Ling 2023).\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world (Sanger and Barnes 2023). These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention (Henriksen 2019, 7). Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the\nContinuity and Change in European Governance\nEUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\ninfrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well."

These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## Keywords Cybersecurity; cyber diplomacy; cyber governance; UN GGE; UN OEWG.\n## 1. INTRODUCTION The US signed bilateral agreements to limit state-sponsored cyberattacks with Russia, in 2013, and China, in 2015. However, several years later, former Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, found in his 2019 report that Russia had systematically interfered by cyber and disinformation means in the 2016 US presidential elections. After several high-profile Chinese cyber espionage campaigns against US governmental targets, Washington and Beijing managed to reach a bilateral agreement aimed at limiting cyberattacks between the two countries. However, Chinese cyber espionage against the US not only continued, but it increased in magnitude, intensity, scale and even recklessness, after a period of relative silence. Moreover, China accused the US, namely the National Security Agency (NSA), of carrying out cyber operations against Huawei since 2009, infiltrating the company's servers. In 2020-2021, a spree of cyber espionage campaigns that used cyberattacks with larger-scale effects provoked a strong reaction from the US, publicly attributing the SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange hack, and several cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic to Russian and Chinese governmental agencies. Even though there was an apparent period of silence in ground-breaking disruptive cyber operations over the last few years, the fact that large state-sponsored cyberattacks did not happen or were not disclosed does not exclude the possibility that there were no preparatory operations for future attacks.\nIn some cases, the US hacked back and 'defended forward', deploying cyber operations against Russia, and the UK and US launched cyberattacks against Daesh. More often, since 2017, the US, UK, EU, and other international actors imposed international sanctions against government entities from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, accusing them of hacking (Willett Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 2021; Broeders et al. 2022). Moreover, sanctions (and US indictments) revealed the true nature of some hacking groups, attributing the hackers to intelligence services units and even specific agents.\nPublic attributions are a key element of every response to a cyber operation. Their significance is consolidated when they are done in cooperation with other international actors, especially if they are part of the UN Security Council. However, such responses do not necessarily prevent future cyberattacks. Moreover, they do not fully address the issue of hacking done by non-state actors, some of which are covertly state-sponsored groups. Therefore, there is a need for a new strategy. Even though cyber operations similar to NotPetya, BlackEnergy or another major interference in high-profile elections have not occurred in the last 5 years, this does not mean that even greater attacks cannot happen (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023; Microsoft 2023).\nThe case of relying extensively on hacking back, defensive cyber operations, hunting forward and so on, could be made, but such actions increase mistrust on the long run. Cyber diplomacy, diplomatic processes in the areas of cyberspace and cybersecurity, is needed to achieve a consensus. However, the UN GGE process is still going on without providing ground-breaking results. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus. The UN GGE process started in the early 2000s, and the OEWG counterpart started in 2019. The groups managed to agree on several reports, but they are far from reaching an international consensus on rules for international cyber conduct by state actors. The latest consensus report was adopted by the group in 2023, but only after difficult discussions. Whilst the 2021 GGE was only close to end in deadlock, the 2017 GGE failed to deliver a consensus report.\nIn order to propose a coherent democratic set of rules for cyberspace, liberal democracies must first reach a consensus on what these rules should be. Only after, the rules should be promoted to 'neutral countries' that are at least somewhat democratic. And so, after convincing even some 'illiberal' Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 democracies and mixed regimes, this set of rules should be heavily promoted at the UN level, in the GGE and OEWG groups and in the Security Council. Nevertheless, using cyber arms for illicit espionage, selling such weapons to actors that could use them for nefarious purposes, engaging in mass digital surveillance without keeping an eye on respecting privacy rights, and so on, do not help the cause. On the contrary, these actions can help solidify the Russian and Chinese view on the discussions and sow distrust.\nThus, in this paper I shall explore the UN GGE (group of governmental experts) and OEWG (open-ended working group) processes, taking into consideration major cyber operations that have occurred during the discussions. The first part of the paper discusses the concepts of cyberspace and cyber diplomacy. The second part explores the processes of the GGEs and OEWGs, from the establishment of the first group in 2004 to the latest consensus report, adopted in 2023 by the second OEWG. This section also considers the most significant cyber operations that could have contributed to the groups reaching consensus. The final part discusses the contending positions of Western states, on one side, and Russia, China, and other likeminded states, on the other side, which promote different models of internet governance. Moreover, this section highlights the importance of cyber diplomacy and takes into consideration democratic initiatives for increasing international cooperation and combat malicious cyber activity, especially state-sponsored operations. In addition to this, the final section describes the current cyber threat landscape, including the uncertainties brought by AI systems.\n# 2. CYBERSPACE, CYBER DIPLOMACY, AND DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM The relation between the adoption of consensus reports by the GGE and cyber operations that have happened in that period has been discussed in relevant literature. It can be fair to assume that the discovery of major state-sponsored cyber operations influenced the work of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 the expert groups. Nonetheless, this paper will not discuss the causality, but it will point out the very same relationship, based on previous works. Moreover, the issue of international norms, complex regimes, and deterrence in cyberspace has been discussed in relevant literature, but they did not focus on the GGE and OEWG processes. In addition to this, past cyber operations have been analysed taking into account newer international cyber norms and limits for state behaviour in cyberspace The obstacles in addressing foreign election interference and in the UN working groups have also been scrutinised.\nCyber diplomacy can be defined as “diplomacy in the cyber domain”, or “the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace”. Cyber diplomacy is conducted in bilateral and multilateral formats, as the issues of cybercrime, internet governance, cybersecurity and so on are discussed in both bilateral meetings and international fora (such as the UN GGE). Cyber diplomacy is sometimes confused with digital diplomacy or e-diplomacy, the latter referring to the actual use of digital technologies and social media by diplomats in various contexts, especially for public communication, public diplomacy and so on.\nLucas Kello (2017, 45) describes cyberspace as a realm comprised by three overlaying domains: the internet, which includes all interconnected devices; the World Wide Web, consisting in all network nodes accessible through URL; and all computer systems which theoretically exist in isolation from the Internet, without having a connection to it. Thus, cyberspace represents an intertwined realm, mixing both physical elements such as computers, microprocessors, network infrastructure etc., and a “social-technological environment”, as people and organisations interact in and through cyberspace. The internet is a transnational network of networks, mostly owned by private companies, but the infrastructure and users fall under the jurisdiction of different sovereign states. Therefore, cybersecurity has been defined by Thierry Balzacq and Myriam Dunn Cavelty as a complex set of practices and policies unravelling in and through cyberspace and designed to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024\"protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access\"(2016, 183).\nMost cyber operations deployed by state actors against their counterparts revolve around espionage objectives. Even though future massive and large scale cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, current research points out that cyber operations are burdened by serious limitations (volatility, unreliability, slow speed, limited intensity), and therefore states will rely on cyber tools mostly for intelligence operations and low-intensity disruptions (Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Mueller et al. 2023). Furthermore, despite the ever-increasing influence of the private tech industry, the state maintains a prominent role in cyberspace, both in its regulation and operation/manipulation (Dunn Cavelty and Egloff 2019). Despite the huge role that private companies enjoy, governmental intelligence agencies are still the main actors in cyber operations, especially in offensive operations. Whilst private companies are usually first-responders in cyber defence for specific attacks, the state still acts as a protector for the whole environment, and especially for sensitive areas of cyberspace.\nMoreover, digital authoritarianism refers to the usage of digital means by authoritarian leaders or governments to repress, surveil, and manipulate domestic and foreign citizens. The primary promoters and adopters of this internet governance model are China and Russia, both using digital authoritarianism to strengthen their domestic rule, influence foreign actors and undermine democracies. Moreover, both of them promote this authoritarian model of internet governance at the UN level. China developed a state-controlled cyberspace, a heavily controlled and monitored internet known as the 'Great Firewall', exporting repressive digital technologies to countries all over the world, but especially to authoritarian regimes. Thus, authoritarian countries aim to protect domestic stability and their regimes by controlling the flow of information.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 # 3. THE UN GGE AND OEWG PROCESSES ## 3.1. The first three groups and major cyber operations (2004-2013) The first UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security was set up in 2004, following a Russian proposal accepted by the US and 13 other states.. In 2005, the UN Secretary-General established a second group of experts to study cyber threats and propose potential measures.\nThe 2007 and 2008 cyberattacks against Estonia and Georgia highlighted the threat to security stemming from cyber means, and could have led the second group of experts to reach a consensus report in 2010. The report underlined that the attribution issue and lack of common understanding of the limits of state conduct in cyberspace increase instability, as cyber means started to become instruments for warfare. The 2010 report included a recommendation to continue the discussions between states, describing it as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risks in cyberspace.\nEstonia was one of the first countries hit by a serious series of cyberattacks. The Baltic country was targeted by a three-week cyberattack campaign launched by Russia, in response to a decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet World War II memorial. For the first time, a major cyberattack was used by a state actor against another state actor to influence its domestic and foreign policies and actions.\nRussia set another dangerous precedent in 2008. At the beginning of the August invasion against Georgia, Russia launched several cyberattacks against the websites of state institutions, Georgian websites, and media outlets, marking the first time when cyber operations were used alongside kinetic military operations. However, it was the United States who launched the most sophisticated, destructive, and bold cyberattack of that time, an attack serving to a clear foreign policy objective – disrupting Iran's nuclear program. In 2009-2010, the US and, reportedly, Israel deployed the Stuxnet malware against Iran, targeting the computer systems of the nuclear facilities in Natanz.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 In 2011, a third group of experts was established by the General Assembly, as the Stuxnet cyberattack became known. The group adopted a consensus report in 2013, the same year as the publication of the Tallinn Manual on international law on cyber issues, backed by NATO and drawn up by Western experts. The UN GGE highlighted that international law, the Charter of the UN, and principles of state sovereignty apply to state conduct of cyber activities, noting that reaching a common view on cyber rules can contribute to fostering peace and security worldwide. Thus, the 2013 report affirmed the main elements which were later included in the 2015 report: adopting non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, applying international law in cyberspace, capacity-building measures, cooperation measures and confidence-building.\nDuring this period, the United States pursued cyber stability through bilateral diplomacy as well, in an effort to reduce the intensity of cyber operations deployed by Russia and China. In 2013, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to reduce risks in cyberspace, providing for a communication link on cybersecurity incidents, including exchanges of technical information between the two parties. In parallel, Iran allegedly launched a cyberattack against Saudi Arabia in 2012, using the Shamoon virus to disrupt the largest oil company in the country, Saudi Aramco. The hack was seen as a response to the Stuxnet operation.\nIn 2015, Washington and Beijing signed an agreement to reduce cyber espionage, with presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping declaring that their governments will not conduct or support cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other\"confidential business information\". Evidence showed that the level of Chinese cyber operations in the United States decreased, but Chinese hacking may have just become stealthier and more refrained from larger cyberattacks. Moreover, China signed a similar deal with the UK, and in the same year the Group of Twenty (G20) agreed that cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property should not be pursued or enabled by any countries, whilst also recognising the role of the UN GGE 2015 report and list of non-binding norms.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 ## 3.2. The fourth group and the 2015 report In 2015, the fourth group submitted another consensus report, expanding on the issue of international law applicability, and highlighting the UN resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age. The 2015 report reiterates the obligations mentioned in the previous document, but it introduced references to the principles of proportionality, necessity, and humanity. The set of norms set out in the report was endorsed by the G20 later that year. The 2015 report of the GGE reached a consensus regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The report specifies that states must observe the same obligations under international law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the cyber realm, as well as in the physical realm. Moreover, the document mentions that critical infrastructure should not be cyberattacked during peacetime and the 2021 report states that electoral processes are part of the sector of critical infrastructure. The GGE noted that states maintain jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory, that they must respect the principles of settling disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in domestic affairs.\n## 3.3. The fifth group and cyber operations (2015-2017) The fifth group, established in 2015, failed to submit a consensus report in 2017, as Cuba, China and Russia did not support the final draft. Thus, the fifth meeting of the GGE ended in a deadlock. The US proposed that cyber norms should be based on the principle that international humanitarian law and existing laws on state responsibility and self-defence should apply in cyberspace. However, Russia, China, and Cuba disagreed, arguing that this would militarize cyberspace.\nIn the meantime, state-sponsored cyberattacks increased in intensity, complexity, and number, producing damages, and undermining affected states, Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 whilst serving political objectives. The most notable example is the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections, using both cyber and disinformation means. The United States officially attributed the 2016 cyber campaign to Russia in 2017, naming the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) as the perpetrators of the hacks and stating that President Vladimir Putin ordered the influence campaign. Russia doubled cyber operations and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome and conduct of the elections. One year later, Russia targeted another important presidential election in the West, hacking the campaign of then-candidate Emmanuel Macron in France, and deploying a hack-and-leak campaign - exfiltrating data from the hacks and disseminating it online through disinformation campaigns. In the same year, the Dutch, French, UK, German, and Swedish elections were targeted by Russian cyber and disinformation campaigns.\nFurthermore, Russia increased the intensity of its operations in Ukraine. In December 2015, Russian government hackers deployed a cyberattack against Ukraine's electrical grid through spreading the BlackEnergy3 malware after gaining access of the networks of energy substation networks. The attack caused a blackout for several hundred thousand persons for several hours, representing one of the first major cyberattacks that affected civilian critical infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Russia hit Ukraine with one of the costliest and most destructive cyberattacks and malware of all time, NotPetya. The attack indiscriminately affected the networks and produced damages to airports, banks, hospitals, power companies, as well as private businesses. Thus, the attack contracted Ukraine's GDP by approximately $0.5\\%$, disabling more than $10\\%$ of computer systems in the country. Moreover, the White House estimated that the cyberattack provoked damages of more than 10 billion dollars, as the malware spread across Ukraine's borders by infecting the networks of transnational companies.\nHowever, Russia was not the only country intensifying cyber operations. The 2017 WannaCry attack was a global ransomware attack attributed to state- Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 sponsored hackers from North Korea. It affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, taking a toll on some companies from Europe. Nonetheless, one of the most affected organisations was UK's National Health System (NHS). In May 2017, the operations of hospitals, clinics, even emergency rooms, were disrupted by the ransomware, spreading through the use of a vulnerability exploit tool stockpiled by the US National Security Agency, and stolen by another hacker group.\n## 3.4. The sixth group and cyber operations (2019-2021) The sixth GGE adopted a consensus report in 2021, expanding upon the norms set out in the previous reports. The 2021 report managed to satisfy the interests of Western countries, as it included references regarding international law and cyberattack attribution, and with respect to the positions of China and Russia as well, as Beijing secured the inclusion of a paragraph regarding supply chain protection, and Moscow introduced a reference to the OEWG. Besides, the report included statements on capacity-building, consultations, and cooperation, satisfying the goals of developing countries.\nRussia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign was one of the most notable operations of this period. In 2020-2021, Russia infiltrated a software used by a large number of companies and institutions in the US - the Orion software, distributed by the SolarWinds company. Russia managed to gain access to data and emails from several US federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. In 2021, the US government announced that several federal agencies were targeted by a large scale cyberattack, part of a cyber espionage campaign later attributed to Moscow. By hacking SolarWinds, a company that supplies software used to monitor and manage IT networks, Russia used it as a vector for transmitting the malware to a large number of devices and networks. Moreover, Russia's SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign coincided with another series of large-scale breaches infecting more than 30.000 private and public entities through a vulnerability of Microsoft's Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Exchange service. The tech company attributed the espionage campaign to Chinese state-actors. In March 2021, the US revealed attributed it to China as well.\n## 3.5. The UN OEWG process (2019-2025) The first OEWG discussions took place between 2019 and 2021. The 2021 report maintained the 11 voluntary norms agreed in 2015 and elaborated on them, mentioning election interference in the threats section, but without including it in the listed norms.\nStarted in 2021, the second and current OEWG process is set to continue until 2025. In July 2023, OEWG member states discussed the issue of norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace at the UN, but contending positions nearly drove the discussions into a new deadlock without adopting a report. The discussions held in July marked the end of the second year of the group, releasing a consensus report on annual progress. One of the highlights of the 2023 report is the proposal of establishing a Points of Contact Directory to enable intergovernmental cooperation on cybersecurity. Moreover, the report includes the recognition of the ransomware threat.\nHowever, the group is far from reaching a consensus on the need of respecting human rights and protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, as current efforts are still stuck on agreeing on a common lexicon of terms. The main issues were the mentions of human rights and concerns regarding the protection of supply chains from cyberattacks. Nevertheless, member states have agreed that international law applies to cyberspace, and on supporting the 11 nonbinding norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nFurthermore, the last OEWG report proposes the creation of a UN Global Points of Contact Directory. Even though concerns about the relation between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and spyware Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 proliferation are high, only ransomware issues were mentioned. Moreover, the report focuses on operations targeting critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure, electoral interference, and the use of disinformation campaigns, including a recognition that cyber and digital tools have already been used in conflicts around the world. Regarding confidence-building measures, the report encourages states to voluntarily share their views on ICT terminologies to bolster understanding and transparency. Moreover, the report requests that three inter-sessional meetings should take place to discuss cyber threats, norms and rules, and the applicability of international law. In addition to this, references to gender issues are more prevalent in the last report. However, a German-led suggestion for a more active reference to the applicability of international human rights law to state behaviour was not included in the document.\n# 4. A WAY FORWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL CYBER REGULATION AND DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES ## 4.1. The current cyber landscape Microsoft's 2023 Digital Defence Report asserts that Iranian and North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups have increased in sophistication in cyber operations, as some of their activities are approaching the levels of complexity of their Russian and Chinese counterparts. Data extortion attacks are on the rise, as more and more ransomware campaigns involve the theft and removal of data from targeted devices. Moreover, ransomware attacks increased over 200% in 2023. Over the last 6 years, ransomware became one of the world's most important and damaging cyber threats.\nEspionage campaigns, some of them deployed on a large scale, have become the favourite type of cyber operations for state-actors, moving away from destructive cyberattacks. However, this could be only a temporary change of tactics, as even techniques used for cyber espionage can enable large scale cyberattacks with destructive intentions (digital or even Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 physical). In addition to this, state actors have begun blending cyber operations with influence operations, disseminating their favoured narratives.\nRecent AI developments are set to have an impact on cyber operations and cybersecurity. Both attackers and defenders will benefit from mechanisms of rapid analysis and scans for vulnerabilities and malware, intrusions, and infiltrations. There are three dimensions of this relationship: cybersecurity for AI, AI for cybersecurity and malicious use of AI (Bezombes, Brunessauax and Cadzow 2023, 10). AI systems and digital services depending on them could become targets of cyberattacks and data poisoning attacks, text inputs that corrupt the dataset, algorithm, or models of an AI system. Furthermore, there are concerns that the latest development in generative AI will lead to an increase in the quantity and quality of disinformation, alongside the ability to spread it to a larger number of people and to targeted groups or individuals. More than 70 countries will hold regional or national elections in 2024, which means that more than 2 billion people will be affected by the outcome, most of them in the Global South.\nA ramped-up series of cyber operations of state and non-state origin could provide an incentive for opposing states and groups to cooperate. Large waves of cyberattacks fuelled by sophisticated AI tools affecting businesses and government services, such as a series of ransomware attacks, a deep and large campaign of cyber espionage exfiltrating highly sensible data from a government, or a cyberattack disrupting energy infrastructure could be tipping points for an increase in international tensions, but also for boosting cooperation before the situation goes out of hand. Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar (2021) showcases that the GGEs managed to adopt consensus reports when the discussions took place in favourable international contexts, characterised by events triggering a common interest in reaching a consensus and relatively low tensions. Either Western countries ramp up cyber responses that disrupt the governments of Russia, China, or Iran, or the rise of non-state actors (cybercriminals) using ransomware indiscriminately could provide an incentive to cooperate alongside groups with different views. Moreover, spyware proliferation around the world Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 could also provide an incentive for cooperation between a varied group of states.\n## 4.2. Contending positions At the end of August 2023, the sixth negotiation session of the Ad Hoc Committee held another talk on a new UN convention on cybercrime, the objective being updating the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention. Russia and a group of like-minded submitted a legally binding instrument for ensuring international information security. At the OEWG-ITU special session in July 2023, Russia, Belarus, Bolivia, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Syria put forward a draft proposal on international information security, rejected by Western states. However, a majority of UN member states (including Western countries) did not accept the proposal for legally binding measures. Western states did not take into consideration the proposal, focusing on advancing current already-agreed norms. Instead, they accept the current UN Framework, consisting in voluntary and nonbinding cyber norms, the application of existing international law and a focus on confidence-building measures.\nIt was Russia's proposal that created the OEWG process in order to avoid deadlocks encountered by the GGE platform, but also to enlarge the number of members in an effort to gain support for Moscow's and Beijing's proposals. Even though a legally binding instrument would contribute to improving accountability, Western countries do not agree to other aspects in Russia's draft proposal. Moreover, a UN Plan of Action, a politically binding instrument, can be a less polarising endeavour and achievable objective.\nIn the context of rising ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and so on, Russia's proposals for the UN Cybercrime Treaty aim at facilitating the processes through which states share information on cyber issues. However, Western states, experts and human rights advocates argue that the proposals could be used as a pretext to further extend digital repression. Written for the issue of cybercrime, Russia's proposals could allow states to extend the scope to Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 suppress free media, dissent, opposition, and other online content. The main issue raised during discussions on the Russia-sponsored treaty is the scope of the proposals and the definition of cybercrime. Russia, China, and other like-minded states want to expand the definition of cybercrime to any crime in which technology is used. However, the US and European countries want to ensure that cybercrime is defined as 'cyber-enabled crimes'. For instance, China proposed that the dissemination of false information should be designated as a cybercrime in an UN convention text. Western countries opposed the idea, taking into account concerns that China would exploit the convention to expand repression against people spreading information critical of the government. Thus, this was the main issue that Western states had with Russia's proposal. Russia and China wanted to expand the scope of cybercrime norms to legitimise laws against government critics, in the spirit of their views on 'information security' (Iyengar, Gramer and Rathi 2023; Weber 2023).\nRussia's aim is to consolidate the repression of online freedom of expression, whilst also limit cyber risks stemming from Western military agencies, but without accepting responsibility for its own cyber operations. Moreover, the proposal fails to adequately mention freedom of expression, even though it mentions briefly human rights, even the right to privacy. Nonetheless, the document does not mention the applicability of international human rights law or norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nResponsible state behaviour in cyberspace, at least for Western democracies, refers to the promotion of nonbinding cyber norms that aim at preventing the proliferation of ransomware, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure that affect civilians, electoral interference and accepting the applicability of international law. However, for states such as Russia, China or Iran, these norms should include the sovereign control over internet traffic in their jurisdiction to prevent unwanted online content from spreading in their countries. During current discussions, China seeks to designate dissemination of false information as a crime, whilst Iran and Pakistan attempt to declare insults to religion as crimes.\nContinuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 Authoritarian and illiberal regimes view information freedom and the idea of an open cyberspace as threats to their systems and power, as they value regime security over civil liberties. Authoritarian states developed national regulations and promoted international models of internet governance in line with their objectives of controlling data and information flows and restricting criticism against their governments. Russia, China, and other states governed by authoritarian regimes view an open cyberspace as a threat to their rule.\nConversely, Western states promote a free, global, open, and secure Internet. For instance, the EU, NATO, and other states (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and so on) accept that international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations during armed conflicts. The view shared by Western democracies on cyberspace is not shared by a majority of states in the UNGA, as China and Russia are convincing an increasingly number of undecided states in the Global South. Meanwhile, Russia and China use incentives such as development partnerships, military aid, digital and tech exports, and trade cooperation to convince undecided states to support their position. Similar tactics could be adopted by Western democracies, too.\nFor instance, China's domestic regulation proposal regarding AI includes requirements for generated content to reflect the values of the Chinese Communist Party, whilst content that undermines the regime would be banned. In contrast, EU's legislation for regulating artificial intelligence would outright ban AI systems that manipulate people, systems used for classifying people based on their socio-economic status. Moreover, the legislation would lead to a ban for some technologies used by predictive policing and on banning biometric identification systems, such as real-time facial recognition.\nDigital authoritarianism, the malicious uses and abuses of digital technologies for repressing dissent, social control and mass surveillance, is also becoming one of the greatest threats to cyberspace. It is also becoming one of the most dangerous threats to democracy and civil society worldwide, as principles, practices and digital tools that enable digital authoritarianism are exported Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 around the world by China and Russia. Moreover, there are some Western companies that export digital repressive technology to authoritarian regimes, and Western governments that engage in digital authoritarian practices.\nChina is a lead exporter and promoter of advanced mass surveillance technologies and systems, including AI-based software capable of facial recognition. Beijing exports its model of digital authoritarianism characterised by a strict control of internet activity and a vast usage of digital technology to control and monitor its population, enticing for authoritarian leaders worldwide. Similar technologies and policies have been adopted in an increasing number of countries worldwide, as Chinese companies with alleged state links are becoming key players in the global tech industry. However, Russia is also an important supplier of technologies and authoritarian policies regarding internet governance and repressive-enabling technology.\nNevertheless, Western companies, whether from Israel, France, the UK, or the United States, are also providing advanced technological systems to authoritarian regimes, such as spyware and hacking tools, surveillance platforms, and internet filtering software. In addition to this, Western countries have adopted their own policies and measures that resemble digital authoritarianism. The revelations made public by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden highlighted two issues in this regard: that in some cases liberal democracies employ similar surveillance tactics as authoritarian states and that there are differences between the approach of the US and European states.\n## 4.3. A democratic alternative and the importance of cyber diplomacy Cyber diplomacy is crucial to limit the use, impact, and scale of cyber operations, and to properly address cyber incidents and avoid escalation. UN discussions on cyber norms need to identify and accept red lines between illegitimate and legitimate targets of Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 cyberattacks, as well as providing a definition of proportionate responses for cyber defence. Thus, cyber diplomacy can contribute to cyber stability. Moreover, there is a need for a monitor and enforcer of agreed norms, such as the UN Security Council, which should impose economic or political sanctions if states violate rules and red lines. Nevertheless, reaching consensus on international internet governance regulations seems increasingly difficult, if not impossible, as differences between states' ideologies, interests and policies are creating a gap that cannot be covered by common goals regarding cybersecurity. Thus, only the most basic norms regarding these issues can be agreed.\nThe US, EU member-states, and likeminded actors should consolidate their cyber diplomacy endeavours. They ought to counter Russia, China, and similar actors' own efforts to promote a repressive view on cyberspace. The main goal of cyber diplomacy is to promote the international adoption of cyber norms and responsible behaviour in cyberspace. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox represents a step in a good direction, especially for implementing sanctions for cyber aggressions. Moreover, cyber diplomacy is the main driver for building and promoting global norms for state conduct in cyberspace, including discussing the applicability of international law in this realm.\nOne goal of Western cyber diplomacy is mobilizing a coalition to promote a common view on a democratic approach to cyberspace international regulations. Moreover, cyber diplomacy should be used to reach an international consensus on how international law applies to cyberspace and what kind of cyber operations represent an equivalent to armed-attacks. Therefore, Western democracies should bolster their efforts of promoting cyber diplomacy and seek to convince the large group of undecided states on the UN cyber norms debate. For instance, the US held its first cybersecurity summit with leaders from Latin America in 2023, a region increasingly affected by cybercrime and influence efforts by China. Another example of cyber diplomacy and coalition building are efforts Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 pursued by the US and its partners, including the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to promote security-by-design as a default for software and technology. Furthermore, coordinated initiatives such as the joint statement on countering commercial spyware proliferation, collective public attributions or coordinated sanctions could also aid efforts to consolidate international cooperation for a more secure global cyberspace.\nFor instance, the Declaration for the Future of the Internet should be used as a foundation for future cooperation in this regard. The declaration was adopted in 2023 by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Israel, Kosovo, Maldives, Niger, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine, among others. The declaration states that infrastructure must be secure and reliable, mentioning that states should refrain from undermining the electoral infrastructure and political processes through disinformation campaigns. The document affirms that states should protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in cyberspace, whilst also support digital literacy and an affordable and inclusive access to internet. Moreover, it calls for refraining from abusing Internet or algorithmic systems for unlawful surveillance and repression, and from imposing internet shutdowns. In addition to this, states should cooperate on boosting cybersecurity internationally, combatting cybercrime and other malicious cyber activities (The White House 2023).\n# 5. CONCLUSIONS The 2023 Freedom on the Net Report, published by Freedom House, highlighted that the level of global internet freedom has declined for thirteen years in a row, as digital repression intensified in authoritarian countries. Thus, the latest advancements in surveillance technology, AI-based systems and other tech and software are enabling a strengthening of digital authoritarianism. Without clear regulations and internationally agreed norms and commitments, the situation will only get worse by the year. Nevertheless, discussions in multilateral fora are Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 not exclusively leading to democratic outcomes. A concerning development emerged from UN's main body for discussing Internet-related policies, the Internet Governance Forum. Even though there has been criticism for holding the Forum in Ethiopia in 2022, heavier criticism was generated by news that the next meeting will be held in Saudi Arabia, a country known for its authoritarian internet policies, including surveillance and censorship.\nEven though Russia's full-blown military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war did not (yet) bring disastrous cyberattacks, this does not mean that the world is safe from large scale destructive cyberattacks. State-actors are focusing on cyber espionage and cybercriminal groups are deploying ransomware en masse, but the possible yet currently improbable threat of a ground-breaking destructive cyberattack has not passed. In addition to this, current low-level cyber operations deployed by state-actors can gain backdoors that can be used for any kind of cyberattack in the future, even though current aims revolve around espionage activities. For instance, Chinese state-sponsored hackers managed to insert malware designed to disrupt US military operations in the event of a conflict, hiding malicious code deep into networks controlling power grids, water supplies and communications systems of US military bases inside the country and around the world. These kind of malware and intrusions can be eventually used for any purposes, or even exploited by other groups, if they are not discovered by the cyber defenders of the affected government.\nUN groups on norming responsible state behaviour in cyberspace are significant even only for maintaining a dialogue on cyber norms and incidents, even though current contending positions hinder the possibility of adopting clear, strict, and large-ranging norms. However, an increase in the intensity, scale, and disruptive effects of cyber operations could lead to an increased will for cooperation. Moreover, civil society groups and transnational NGOs could also aid the promotion of international norms on cyberspace. Until then, key players in the tech industry proposed various strategies to protect cyberspace, such as Microsoft's 2017 Digital Geneva Convention. Even though the state is the main actor in cyberspace and especially the strategic use of cyber means, private actors are crucial players, controlling a large part of the Continuity and Change in European Governance EUROPOLITY, vol. 18, no. 2, 2024 infrastructure and engaging in cybersecurity and cyber defence endeavours, and they could eventually gain a more important role in the international regulation of cyberspace as well."

    "abstract": "Western democracies imposed international sanctions, issued internationally coordinated public attributions, and/or deployed defensive cyberattacks after being hit by major cyber operations. These responses and measures have a role in reducing malicious state-sponsored activity, but their success is only temporary (if any). Bilateral agreements, such as the one between the US and China, are limited in scope, playing only a brief role. Moreover, a cyber arms control treaty could contribute to a more peaceful cyberspace, but it would be remarkably difficult to monitor compliance. Thus, in this study I shall explore the development and role of the two main United Nations processes on the security and usage of cyber technologies by state actors. In parallel, the paper will discuss the major cyber operations that have occurred during these processes, highlighting that progress has been largely obtained after escalations in cyber operations. The United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts and the Open-Ended Working Groups have achieved some limited results, but conclusive success is far from being obtained. State-actors' behaviour in cyberspace is still an issue that needs to be regulated and normed at an international level, but it will be difficult to achieve a meaningful consensus among several loosely-formed groups of states with very different approaches to these issues. Thus, democratic states need to go beyond sanctions and use cyber diplomacy for the adoption of an international set of rules.
