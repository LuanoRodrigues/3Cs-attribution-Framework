Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\n\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts.¹ Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n\n¹ David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n© 2020 International Bar Association\n\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group",

This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity.² In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown.³ At first glance,\n\n2 Although this article focuses on the possibility of grid failure in the United States, it is imperative to note that what is possible in the United States is possible in virtually any other country reliant on electric power rooted in industrial control systems, which includes nearly every country on the planet. Also, an honest examination of this topic is an attempt at thoroughness; security of the grid is simply too complex for an exhaustive treatment in one article. The author accepts, therefore, that many critical topics may go unnoticed in this article, but this should not be interpreted as implying anything about the significance or insignificance of those other issues.\n\n3 See Lily Hay Newman, ‘Why It’s So Hard to Restart Venezuela’s Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 12 March 2019) www.wired.com/story/venezuela-power-outage-black-start accessed 14 March 2020; see also Lily Hay Newman, ‘The Hail Mary Plan to Restart a Hacked US Electric Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 14 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/black-start-power-grid-darpa-plum-island accessed 14 March 2020.",

If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously?⁴ In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\n\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world.⁵ It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.⁶ The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code.⁷ Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.⁸ The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\n\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade.⁹ The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n\n4 United States Environmental Protection Agency, ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n5 Manimaran Govindarasu and Adam Hahn, ‘Cybersecurity of the Power Grid: A Growing Concern’ (GCN, 24 February 2017) https://gcn.com/articles/2017/02/24/power-grid-cybersecurity.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n6 Ibid.\n7 See generally Matthew Lave, ‘Complex Systems and the Electric Grid’ (Sandia National Laboratories) www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1366842 accessed 14 March 2020.\n8 Newman, ‘Hail Mary Plan’ (n 3).\n9 Katie Bo Williams and Cory Bennett, ‘Why A Power Grid Attack Is a Nightmare Scenario’ (The Hill, 30 May 2016) https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/281494-why-a-power-grid-attack-is-a-nightmare-scenario accessed 14 March 2020; see also Richard Gray, ‘What Would Happen in an Apocalyptic Blackout?’ (BBC Future, 24 October 2019) www.bbc.com/future/article/20191023-what-would-happen-in-an-apocalyptic-blackout accessed 14 March 2020.",

Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\n\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\n\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\n\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’).²⁴ The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid.²⁵ The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico.²⁶ In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.²⁷\n\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems.²⁸ The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas).²⁹ The Western Interconnection includes\n\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n22 Endress (n 21).\n\n23 Kate O’Flaherty, ‘Iranian Hackers Are Going After a Disturbing New Physical Target’ (Forbes 21 November 2019) www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/11/21/iranian-hackers-could-be-going-after-a-disturbing-new-physical-target/#4536d8ba7d2a accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n24 Andrew Charles Wills, ‘A Background on NERC’ (American Security Project, 30 January 2014) www.americansecurityproject.org/nerc accessed 14 March 2020; see also United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n25 Wills (n 24).\n\n26 US EPA (n 24).\n\n27 Ibid.\n\n28 US EPA (n 24).\n\n29 Ibid.",

Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\n\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids.³³ The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’.³⁴ At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid.³⁵ Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\n\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked.³⁶ Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.³⁷\n\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks.³⁸ To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid.³⁹ With fewer resources than large\n\n30 Ibid.\n31 Ibid.\n32 Alaska and Hawaii have their own interconnections.

All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software.⁴⁴ It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’.⁴⁵ The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.⁴⁶\n\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business.⁴⁷ In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA).⁴⁸ Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid.⁴⁹ While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n\n40 Ibid.\n41 Ibid.\n42 Ibid.\n43 Ibid.\n44 Ibid.\n45 Annie I.

To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\n\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems.⁵¹ An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it.⁵² This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\n\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’.⁵³ A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities.⁵⁴ This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television.⁵⁵ Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring.⁵⁶ It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.⁵⁷\n\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.⁵⁸\n\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.⁵⁹\n\n50 Ibid.\n51 David Fickling, ‘Cyber Attacks Make Smart Grids Look Dumb’ (Bloomberg, 17 June 2019) www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-17/argentina-blaming-hackers-for-outage-makes-smart-grids-look-dumb accessed 14 March 2020.\n52 Dan O’Shea, ‘LG Introduces Smart Refrigerator with Amazon Alexa-Enabled Grocery Ordering’ (RetailDive.com, 4 January 2017) www.retaildive.com/news/lg-introduces-smart-refrigerator-with-amazon-alexa-enabled-grocery-ordering/433366 accessed 14 March 2020.\n53 Fickling (n 51).\n54 Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, ‘Smart Meter Q&amp;A’ www.puc.state.pa.us/General/consumer_ed/pdf/13_Smart%20Meters.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n55 Ibid.\n56 Ibid.\n57 Ibid.\n58 Ibid.\n59 Christopher Bosch, ‘Securing the Smart Grid: Protecting National Security and Privacy Through Mandatory, Enforceable Interoperability Standards’ (March 2016) 41(4) Fordham Urban Law Journal 1352.",

The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER).⁶⁰ The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’.⁶¹ The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.⁶²\n\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets.⁶³ Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year.⁶⁴ At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.⁶⁵\n\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n\n⁶⁰ United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n⁶⁴ Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁶⁵ See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.",

The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\n\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities.⁶⁸ Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’.⁶⁹ It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.⁷⁰\n\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications.⁷¹ Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers.⁷² Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense).⁷³ Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n\n⁶⁶ See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n⁶⁷ Ibid.\n⁶⁸ Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n⁶⁹ Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁷⁰ Carr (n 10).\n⁷¹ Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\n\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n\n## 3. The current situation\n\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\n\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\n\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n\n74 See generally Richard Clarke, *Cyber War – The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It* (Harper Collins 2010).\n\n75 Benjamin Monarch, ‘One Minute to Midnight: Amending the War Powers Resolution to Confront the Coming Cyber Wars’ (2015) 103 Kentucky Law Journal 462; Booz Allen Hamilton, ‘When the Lights Went Out: A Comprehensive Review of the 2015 Attacks on Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure’ www. boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out. pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n76 National Intelligence Council, *Global Trends 2025* (U.S. Government Printing Office 2008) 97.",

To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.⁸⁰\n\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’.⁸¹ He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used.⁸² Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states.⁸³ Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master.⁸⁴ This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.⁸⁵\n\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016.⁸⁶ The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down.⁸⁷ Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.⁸⁸\n\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n\n77 Andy Greenberg, ‘Here’s the Evidence that Links Russia’s Most Brazen Attacks’ (Wired Magazine, 15 November 2019) www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-cyberattack-links accessed 14 March 2020; Michael Imeson, ‘Russia Cyber Aggression Fuels Tensions with West’ (Financial Times, 13 October 2019) www.ft.com/content/0aa7a6e0-ca52-11e9-af46-b09e8bf60c0 accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n78 Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, ‘Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (18 March 2016) https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf\n\n79 Ibid.\n\n80 Michael Assante, ‘Confirmation of a Coordinated Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (SANS Blog, 6 January 2016) https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-a-coordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid\n\n81 Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired.com, 3 August 2016) www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n82 Ibid.\n\n83 Ibid.\n\n84 Kim Zetter, ‘Everything We Know About Ukraine’s Power Plant Hack’ (Wired Magazine, 20 January 2016) www.wired.com/2016/01/everything-we-know-about-ukraines-power-plant-hack accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n85 Monarch (n 75).\n\n86 Kim Zetter, ‘The Ukrainian Power Grid was Attacked Again’ (VICE, 10 January 2017) www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n87 Ibid.\n\n88 Ibid.",

Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.⁹⁰\n\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\n\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’.⁹¹ To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack.⁹² Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence.⁹³ Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants.⁹⁴ The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant.⁹⁵ Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\n\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies).⁹⁶ It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities.

This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\n\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\n\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\n\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well.

This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system).¹⁰⁵ Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies.¹⁰⁶ Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\n\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary.

Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.¹¹⁰\n\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries.

It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\n\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\n\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.¹¹³\n\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n\n---\n\n¹¹¹ Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n¹¹² *Ibid.*\n¹¹³ Hamilton (n 75).

Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering:¹¹⁴ In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’.¹¹⁵ An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit.¹¹⁶ The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations.¹¹⁷ While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n\n¹¹⁴ Ibid.\n\n¹¹⁵ Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n\n¹¹⁶ Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.",

            "markdown": "electricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker",

This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been",

The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between",

While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n\n### Post-mortem or restoration\n\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To",

One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\n\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\n\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n\n### 5.1.

For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages.¹²⁴ This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\n\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism.¹²⁵ This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century.¹²⁶ Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\n\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018.¹²⁷ This figure is expected to rise.¹²⁸ Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\n\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n\n¹²⁴ Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹²⁵ Ibid.\n¹²⁶ Ibid.\n¹²⁷ Ibid.\n¹²⁸ Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.",

For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n\n## 5.2. More warriors\n\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’.¹²⁹ Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions.¹³⁰ There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\n\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\n\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry.¹³¹ If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n\n¹²⁹ William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n¹³⁰ Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n\n¹³¹ Ibid.",

The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n\n### Sharing is caring\n\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\n\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\n\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n\n### Don't forget the little guy\n\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats.

It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\n\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\n\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^\n\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\n\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\n\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a\n\n^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.",

First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\n\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\n\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\n\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\n\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^\n\n135 Bosch (n 59).\n\n136 Ibid.",

These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on.¹³⁹ These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.¹⁴⁰\n\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n\n## 5.7.

Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\n\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\n\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n\n## 6.

Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts.¹ Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n¹ David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group\nB Monarch\npresents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity.² In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown.³ At first glance,\n2 Although this article focuses on the possibility of grid failure in the United States, it is imperative to note that what is possible in the United States is possible in virtually any other country reliant on electric power rooted in industrial control systems, which includes nearly every country on the planet. Also, an honest examination of this topic is an attempt at thoroughness; security of the grid is simply too complex for an exhaustive treatment in one article. The author accepts, therefore, that many critical topics may go unnoticed in this article, but this should not be interpreted as implying anything about the significance or insignificance of those other issues.\n3 See Lily Hay Newman, ‘Why It’s So Hard to Restart Venezuela’s Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 12 March 2019) www.wired.com/story/venezuela-power-outage-black-start accessed 14 March 2020; see also Lily Hay Newman, ‘The Hail Mary Plan to Restart a Hacked US Electric Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 14 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/black-start-power-grid-darpa-plum-island accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133\nthis description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously?⁴ In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world.⁵ It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.⁶ The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code.⁷ Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.⁸ The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade.⁹ The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n4 United States Environmental Protection Agency, ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n5 Manimaran Govindarasu and Adam Hahn, ‘Cybersecurity of the Power Grid: A Growing Concern’ (GCN, 24 February 2017) https://gcn.com/articles/2017/02/24/power-grid-cybersecurity.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n6 Ibid.\n7 See generally Matthew Lave, ‘Complex Systems and the Electric Grid’ (Sandia National Laboratories) www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1366842 accessed 14 March 2020.\n8 Newman, ‘Hail Mary Plan’ (n 3).\n9 Katie Bo Williams and Cory Bennett, ‘Why A Power Grid Attack Is a Nightmare Scenario’ (The Hill, 30 May 2016) https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/281494-why-a-power-grid-attack-is-a-nightmare-scenario accessed 14 March 2020; see also Richard Gray, ‘What Would Happen in an Apocalyptic Blackout?’ (BBC Future, 24 October 2019) www.bbc.com/future/article/20191023-what-would-happen-in-an-apocalyptic-blackout accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nscience fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.¹⁰\nAttacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems.¹¹ Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states.¹² Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades.¹³ Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware.¹⁴ Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.¹⁵\nThus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive.¹⁶ However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’.¹⁷ Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities.¹⁸ A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack.¹⁹ However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably.²⁰ Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017.²¹ That breach focused on the safety control system of\n¹⁰ See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹ Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹² *Ibid.*\n¹³ *Ibid.*\n¹⁴ Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁵ Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁶ David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁷ *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* (March 2018) www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁸ Sanger (n 16).\n¹⁹ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n²⁰ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n²¹ Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135\nthe plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers.²² In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed.²³ These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’).²⁴ The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid.²⁵ The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico.²⁶ In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.²⁷\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems.²⁸ The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas).²⁹ The Western Interconnection includes\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n22 Endress (n 21).\n23 Kate O’Flaherty, ‘Iranian Hackers Are Going After a Disturbing New Physical Target’ (Forbes 21 November 2019) www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/11/21/iranian-hackers-could-be-going-after-a-disturbing-new-physical-target/#4536d8ba7d2a accessed 14 March 2020.\n24 Andrew Charles Wills, ‘A Background on NERC’ (American Security Project, 30 January 2014) www.americansecurityproject.org/nerc accessed 14 March 2020; see also United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n25 Wills (n 24).\n26 US EPA (n 24).\n27 Ibid.\n28 US EPA (n 24).\n29 Ibid.\nB Monarch\nthe Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas).³⁰ Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas.³¹ These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States.³² For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids.³³ The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’.³⁴ At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid.³⁵ Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked.³⁶ Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.³⁷\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks.³⁸ To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid.³⁹ With fewer resources than large\n30 Ibid.\n31 Ibid.\n32 Alaska and Hawaii have their own interconnections.

All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software.⁴⁴ It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’.⁴⁵ The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.⁴⁶\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business.⁴⁷ In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA).⁴⁸ Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid.⁴⁹ While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n40 Ibid.\n41 Ibid.\n42 Ibid.\n43 Ibid.\n44 Ibid.\n45 Annie I.

To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems.⁵¹ An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it.⁵² This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’.⁵³ A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities.⁵⁴ This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television.⁵⁵ Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring.⁵⁶ It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.⁵⁷\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.⁵⁸\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.⁵⁹\n50 Ibid.\n51 David Fickling, ‘Cyber Attacks Make Smart Grids Look Dumb’ (Bloomberg, 17 June 2019) www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-17/argentina-blaming-hackers-for-outage-makes-smart-grids-look-dumb accessed 14 March 2020.\n52 Dan O’Shea, ‘LG Introduces Smart Refrigerator with Amazon Alexa-Enabled Grocery Ordering’ (RetailDive.com, 4 January 2017) www.retaildive.com/news/lg-introduces-smart-refrigerator-with-amazon-alexa-enabled-grocery-ordering/433366 accessed 14 March 2020.\n53 Fickling (n 51).\n54 Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, ‘Smart Meter Q&amp;A’ www.puc.state.pa.us/General/consumer_ed/pdf/13_Smart%20Meters.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n55 Ibid.\n56 Ibid.\n57 Ibid.\n58 Ibid.\n59 Christopher Bosch, ‘Securing the Smart Grid: Protecting National Security and Privacy Through Mandatory, Enforceable Interoperability Standards’ (March 2016) 41(4) Fordham Urban Law Journal 1352.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139\nFinally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER).⁶⁰ The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’.⁶¹ The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.⁶²\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets.⁶³ Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year.⁶⁴ At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.⁶⁵\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n⁶⁰ United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n⁶⁴ Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁶⁵ See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nservices.⁶⁶ Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern.⁶⁷ This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities.⁶⁸ Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’.⁶⁹ It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.⁷⁰\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications.⁷¹ Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers.⁷² Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense).⁷³ Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n⁶⁶ See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n⁶⁷ Ibid.\n⁶⁸ Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n⁶⁹ Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁷⁰ Carr (n 10).\n⁷¹ Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n74 See generally Richard Clarke, *Cyber War – The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It* (Harper Collins 2010).\n75 Benjamin Monarch, ‘One Minute to Midnight: Amending the War Powers Resolution to Confront the Coming Cyber Wars’ (2015) 103 Kentucky Law Journal 462; Booz Allen Hamilton, ‘When the Lights Went Out: A Comprehensive Review of the 2015 Attacks on Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure’ www. boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out. pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n76 National Intelligence Council, *Global Trends 2025* (U.S. Government Printing Office 2008) 97.\nB Monarch\nattacks.⁷⁷ To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers).⁷⁸ The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour.⁷⁹ Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.⁸⁰\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’.⁸¹ He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used.⁸² Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states.⁸³ Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master.⁸⁴ This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.⁸⁵\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016.⁸⁶ The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down.⁸⁷ Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.⁸⁸\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n77 Andy Greenberg, ‘Here’s the Evidence that Links Russia’s Most Brazen Attacks’ (Wired Magazine, 15 November 2019) www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-cyberattack-links accessed 14 March 2020; Michael Imeson, ‘Russia Cyber Aggression Fuels Tensions with West’ (Financial Times, 13 October 2019) www.ft.com/content/0aa7a6e0-ca52-11e9-af46-b09e8bf60c0 accessed 14 March 2020.\n78 Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, ‘Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (18 March 2016) https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf\n79 Ibid.\n80 Michael Assante, ‘Confirmation of a Coordinated Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (SANS Blog, 6 January 2016) https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-a-coordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid\n81 Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired.com, 3 August 2016) www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid accessed 14 March 2020.\n82 Ibid.\n83 Ibid.\n84 Kim Zetter, ‘Everything We Know About Ukraine’s Power Plant Hack’ (Wired Magazine, 20 January 2016) www.wired.com/2016/01/everything-we-know-about-ukraines-power-plant-hack accessed 14 March 2020.\n85 Monarch (n 75).\n86 Kim Zetter, ‘The Ukrainian Power Grid was Attacked Again’ (VICE, 10 January 2017) www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report accessed 14 March 2020.\n87 Ibid.\n88 Ibid.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143\ncyber warfare tools and tactics.⁸⁹ Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:\n‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.⁹⁰\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’.⁹¹ To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack.⁹² Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence.⁹³ Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants.⁹⁴ The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant.⁹⁵ Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies).⁹⁶ It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the\n⁸⁹ Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁰ Ibid.\n⁹¹ Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹² Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹³ Ibid.\n⁹⁴ Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁵ Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁶ Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nwill is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital\n97 FERC News Release, ‘FERC Strengthens Cyber Security Standards for Bulk System’ (20 June 2019) www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2019/2019-2/06-20-19-E-2.asp#.Xm2esy2ZM0Q; CriticalInfrastructureProtectionReliabilityStandardCIP-008-6 accessed 14 March 2020.\n98 Ibid; Environment and Energy Bloomberg, ‘INSIGHT: New FERC Cyber Rules May Push Companies to Revise Plans’ (14 August 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/insight-new-ferc-cyber-rules-may-push-companies-to-revise-plans accessed 14 March 2020.\n99 Christian Vasquez, ‘Feds Band Against Energy Hackers as Ransom Threat Rises’ (EnergyWire, 4 February 2020) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1062258033 accessed 14 March 2020.\n100 Ibid.\n101 Mohana Ravindranath, ‘27 Separate Federal Programs Protect Power Grid’ (Nextgov.com, 27 February 2017) www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2017/02/27-separate-federal-programs-protect-power-grid/135740 accessed 14 March 2020.\n102 Robert Walton, ‘Senate Passes Cybersecurity Bill to Decrease Grid Digitization, Move toward Manual Control’ (Utility Dive, 1 July 2019) www.utilitydive.com/news/senate-passes-cybersecurity-bill-to-decrease-grid-digitization-move-toward/557959 accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145\nsystems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe.¹⁰³ Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.¹⁰⁴\nAt a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system).¹⁰⁵ Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies.¹⁰⁶ Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’.¹⁰⁷ Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’.¹⁰⁸ The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy.¹⁰⁹ In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.¹¹⁰\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort\n¹⁰³ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁹ Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ (September 2018) https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁰ The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch\nis the Stuxnet computer virus.¹¹¹ This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction.¹¹² To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.¹¹³\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n---\n¹¹¹ Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n¹¹² *Ibid.*\n¹¹³ Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147\namong many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering:¹¹⁴ In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’.¹¹⁵ An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit.¹¹⁶ The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations.¹¹⁷ While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n¹¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹¹⁵ Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n¹¹⁶ Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker\nsubsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been\ndemonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between\nthe facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To\navoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n### 5.1. An insurance programme\nCyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153\nattack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages.¹²⁴ This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism.¹²⁵ This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century.¹²⁶ Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018.¹²⁷ This figure is expected to rise.¹²⁸ Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n¹²⁴ Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹²⁵ Ibid.\n¹²⁶ Ibid.\n¹²⁷ Ibid.\n¹²⁸ Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nmust be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’.¹²⁹ Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions.¹³⁰ There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry.¹³¹ If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n¹²⁹ William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁰ Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³¹ Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the\nB Monarch\nsmaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a\n^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157\nuniversity level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^\n135 Bosch (n 59).\n136 Ibid.\nB Monarch\nSometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.¹³⁷\nIt is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide.¹³⁸ The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on.¹³⁹ These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.¹⁴⁰\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war')\nThe previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n¹³⁷ Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁸ Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁹ Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁴⁰ Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159\nFirst, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that\n160 B Monarch\nwould have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life.",

Email: benlmonarch@gmail.com\n(Received 9 February 2020; final version received 15 March 2020)\nIndustries and governments across the world are confronting an ever-growing wave of cyber attacks. Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts. Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group\nB Monarch\npresents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity. In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown. At first glance,\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133\nthis description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously? In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world. It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines. The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code. Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats. The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade. The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n\nB Monarch\nscience fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.\nAttacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems. Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states. Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades. Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware. Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.\nThus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive. However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’. Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities. A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack. However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably. Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017. That breach focused on the safety control system of\n See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid.*\n *Ibid.*\n Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* (March 2018) www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Sanger (n 16).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135\nthe plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers. In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed. These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’). The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid. The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico. In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems. The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas). The Western Interconnection includes\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n\nB Monarch\nthe Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas). Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas. These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States. For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids. The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’. At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid. Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked. Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks. To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid. With fewer resources than large\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 137\npublic utilities as well as fewer regulatory safeguards, small utilities companies are less equipped to thwart cyber attacks. Hackers, notably those connected with Russia, have taken notice of this fact and have exploited smaller, weaker utilities. These utilities ‘have trouble finding sufficiently skilled workers who understand how the computerized and physical components of the grid work together and how to protect them’. Although bigger utility companies often establish best cyber defence practices, smaller utility companies either cannot afford or are not inclined to adopt those protections. The only upside when assessing the vulnerabilities of smaller distribution grids is that if an attack is limited to a single, minor grid, then the attack will likely have fewer negative consequences.\nWhile efforts are underway to promote better cyber defence management across the entire grid, small or large, another element of power generation and distribution poses a risk: the grid component supply chain. All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software. It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’. The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business. In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA). Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid. While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n\nB Monarch\nlack an investment component. Thus, utility companies, large and small, continue to rely on technology from third-party vendors that may contain exploitive features that permit grid disruption.\nIn effect, the United States grid is a patchwork quilt of digital and physical technology from innumerable sources. To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems. An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it. This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’. A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities. This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television. Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring. It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139\nFinally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER). The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’. The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets. Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year. At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nservices. Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern. This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities. Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’. It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications. Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers. Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense). Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n Ibid.\n Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n Carr (n 10).\n Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n\nB Monarch\nattacks. To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers). The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour. Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’. He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used. Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states. Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master. This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016. The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down. Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143\ncyber warfare tools and tactics. Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:\n‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’. To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack. Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence. Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants. The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant. Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies). It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the\n Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nwill is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145\nsystems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe. Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.\nAt a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system). Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies. Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’. Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’. The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ (September 2018) https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch\nis the Stuxnet computer virus. This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction. To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n---\n Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n *Ibid.*\n Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147\namong many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering: In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’. An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit. The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations. While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n Ibid.\n Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker\nsubsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been\ndemonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between\nthe facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To\navoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n### 5.1. An insurance programme\nCyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153\nattack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages. This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism. This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century. Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018. This figure is expected to rise. Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nmust be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’. Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions. There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry. If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the\nB Monarch\nsmaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a\n^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157\nuniversity level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^\n\nB Monarch\nSometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.\nIt is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide. The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on. These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war')\nThe previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159\nFirst, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that\n\nwould have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life.",

Email: benlmonarch@gmail.com\n(Received 9 February 2020; final version received 15 March 2020)\nIndustries and governments across the world are confronting an ever-growing wave of cyber attacks. Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts. Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group\nB Monarch\npresents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity. In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown. At first glance,\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133\nthis description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously? In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world. It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines. The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code. Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats. The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade. The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n\nB Monarch\nscience fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.\nAttacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems. Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states. Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades. Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware. Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.\nThus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive. However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’. Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities. A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack. However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably. Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017. That breach focused on the safety control system of\n See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid.*\n *Ibid.*\n Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* (March 2018) www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Sanger (n 16).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135\nthe plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers. In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed. These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’). The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid. The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico. In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems. The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas). The Western Interconnection includes\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n\nB Monarch\nthe Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas). Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas. These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States. For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids. The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’. At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid. Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked. Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks. To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid. With fewer resources than large\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 137\npublic utilities as well as fewer regulatory safeguards, small utilities companies are less equipped to thwart cyber attacks. Hackers, notably those connected with Russia, have taken notice of this fact and have exploited smaller, weaker utilities. These utilities ‘have trouble finding sufficiently skilled workers who understand how the computerized and physical components of the grid work together and how to protect them’. Although bigger utility companies often establish best cyber defence practices, smaller utility companies either cannot afford or are not inclined to adopt those protections. The only upside when assessing the vulnerabilities of smaller distribution grids is that if an attack is limited to a single, minor grid, then the attack will likely have fewer negative consequences.\nWhile efforts are underway to promote better cyber defence management across the entire grid, small or large, another element of power generation and distribution poses a risk: the grid component supply chain. All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software. It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’. The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business. In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA). Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid. While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n\nB Monarch\nlack an investment component. Thus, utility companies, large and small, continue to rely on technology from third-party vendors that may contain exploitive features that permit grid disruption.\nIn effect, the United States grid is a patchwork quilt of digital and physical technology from innumerable sources. To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems. An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it. This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’. A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities. This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television. Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring. It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139\nFinally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER). The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’. The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets. Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year. At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nservices. Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern. This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities. Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’. It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications. Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers. Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense). Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n Ibid.\n Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n Carr (n 10).\n Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n\nB Monarch\nattacks. To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers). The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour. Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’. He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used. Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states. Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master. This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016. The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down. Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143\ncyber warfare tools and tactics. Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:\n‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’. To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack. Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence. Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants. The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant. Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies). It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the\n Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nwill is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145\nsystems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe. Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.\nAt a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system). Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies. Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’. Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’. The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ (September 2018) https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch\nis the Stuxnet computer virus. This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction. To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n---\n Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n *Ibid.*\n Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147\namong many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering: In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’. An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit. The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations. While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n Ibid.\n Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker\nsubsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been\ndemonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between\nthe facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To\navoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n### 5.1. An insurance programme\nCyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153\nattack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages. This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism. This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century. Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018. This figure is expected to rise. Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nmust be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’. Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions. There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry. If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the\nB Monarch\nsmaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a\n^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157\nuniversity level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^\n\nB Monarch\nSometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.\nIt is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide. The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on. These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war')\nThe previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159\nFirst, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that\n\nwould have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life.",

Also, an honest examination of this topic is an attempt at thoroughness; security of the grid is simply too complex for an exhaustive treatment in one article. The author accepts, therefore, that many critical topics may go unnoticed in this article, but this should not be interpreted as implying anything about the significance or insignificance of those other issues.",

Email: benlmonarch@gmail.com\n(Received 9 February 2020; final version received 15 March 2020)\nIndustries and governments across the world are confronting an ever-growing wave of cyber attacks. Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts. Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group\nB Monarch\npresents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity. In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown. At first glance,\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133\nthis description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously? In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world. It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines. The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code. Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats. The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade. The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n\nB Monarch\nscience fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.\nAttacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems. Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states. Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades. Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware. Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.\nThus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive. However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’. Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities. A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack. However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably. Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017. That breach focused on the safety control system of\n See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid.*\n *Ibid.*\n Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* (March 2018) www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Sanger (n 16).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135\nthe plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers. In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed. These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’). The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid. The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico. In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems. The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas). The Western Interconnection includes\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n\nB Monarch\nthe Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas). Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas. These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States. For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids. The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’. At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid. Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked. Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks. To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid. With fewer resources than large\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 137\npublic utilities as well as fewer regulatory safeguards, small utilities companies are less equipped to thwart cyber attacks. Hackers, notably those connected with Russia, have taken notice of this fact and have exploited smaller, weaker utilities. These utilities ‘have trouble finding sufficiently skilled workers who understand how the computerized and physical components of the grid work together and how to protect them’. Although bigger utility companies often establish best cyber defence practices, smaller utility companies either cannot afford or are not inclined to adopt those protections. The only upside when assessing the vulnerabilities of smaller distribution grids is that if an attack is limited to a single, minor grid, then the attack will likely have fewer negative consequences.\nWhile efforts are underway to promote better cyber defence management across the entire grid, small or large, another element of power generation and distribution poses a risk: the grid component supply chain. All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software. It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’. The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business. In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA). Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid. While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n\nB Monarch\nlack an investment component. Thus, utility companies, large and small, continue to rely on technology from third-party vendors that may contain exploitive features that permit grid disruption.\nIn effect, the United States grid is a patchwork quilt of digital and physical technology from innumerable sources. To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems. An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it. This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’. A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities. This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television. Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring. It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139\nFinally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER). The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’. The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets. Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year. At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nservices. Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern. This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities. Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’. It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications. Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers. Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense). Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n Ibid.\n Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n Carr (n 10).\n Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n\nB Monarch\nattacks. To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers). The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour. Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’. He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used. Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states. Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master. This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016. The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down. Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143\ncyber warfare tools and tactics. Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:\n‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’. To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack. Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence. Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants. The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant. Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies). It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the\n Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nwill is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital\n\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145\nsystems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe. Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.\nAt a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system). Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies. Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’. Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’. The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ (September 2018) https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch\nis the Stuxnet computer virus. This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction. To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n---\n Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n *Ibid.*\n Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147\namong many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering: In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’. An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit. The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations. While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n Ibid.\n Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker\nsubsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been\ndemonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between\nthe facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To\navoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n### 5.1. An insurance programme\nCyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153\nattack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages. This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism. This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century. Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018. This figure is expected to rise. Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nmust be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’. Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions. There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry. If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the\nB Monarch\nsmaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a\n^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157\nuniversity level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^\n\nB Monarch\nSometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.\nIt is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide. The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on. These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war')\nThe previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159\nFirst, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that\n\nwould have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life."

Email: benlmonarch@gmail.com\n(Received 9 February 2020; final version received 15 March 2020)\nIndustries and governments across the world are confronting an ever-growing wave of cyber attacks. Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction\n## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters\nIn the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts.¹ Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now\n¹ David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association\nRoutledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group\nB Monarch\npresents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity.² In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world\n‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown.³ At first glance,\n2 Although this article focuses on the possibility of grid failure in the United States, it is imperative to note that what is possible in the United States is possible in virtually any other country reliant on electric power rooted in industrial control systems, which includes nearly every country on the planet. Also, an honest examination of this topic is an attempt at thoroughness; security of the grid is simply too complex for an exhaustive treatment in one article. The author accepts, therefore, that many critical topics may go unnoticed in this article, but this should not be interpreted as implying anything about the significance or insignificance of those other issues.\n3 See Lily Hay Newman, ‘Why It’s So Hard to Restart Venezuela’s Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 12 March 2019) www.wired.com/story/venezuela-power-outage-black-start accessed 14 March 2020; see also Lily Hay Newman, ‘The Hail Mary Plan to Restart a Hacked US Electric Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 14 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/black-start-power-grid-darpa-plum-island accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133\nthis description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously?⁴ In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world.⁵ It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.⁶ The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code.⁷ Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.⁸ The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade.⁹ The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to\n4 United States Environmental Protection Agency, ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n5 Manimaran Govindarasu and Adam Hahn, ‘Cybersecurity of the Power Grid: A Growing Concern’ (GCN, 24 February 2017) https://gcn.com/articles/2017/02/24/power-grid-cybersecurity.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n6 Ibid.\n7 See generally Matthew Lave, ‘Complex Systems and the Electric Grid’ (Sandia National Laboratories) www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1366842 accessed 14 March 2020.\n8 Newman, ‘Hail Mary Plan’ (n 3).\n9 Katie Bo Williams and Cory Bennett, ‘Why A Power Grid Attack Is a Nightmare Scenario’ (The Hill, 30 May 2016) https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/281494-why-a-power-grid-attack-is-a-nightmare-scenario accessed 14 March 2020; see also Richard Gray, ‘What Would Happen in an Apocalyptic Blackout?’ (BBC Future, 24 October 2019) www.bbc.com/future/article/20191023-what-would-happen-in-an-apocalyptic-blackout accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nscience fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.¹⁰\nAttacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems.¹¹ Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states.¹² Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades.¹³ Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware.¹⁴ Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.¹⁵\nThus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive.¹⁶ However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’.¹⁷ Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities.¹⁸ A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack.¹⁹ However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably.²⁰ Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017.²¹ That breach focused on the safety control system of\n¹⁰ See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹ Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹² *Ibid.*\n¹³ *Ibid.*\n¹⁴ Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁵ Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁶ David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁷ *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* (March 2018) www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁸ Sanger (n 16).\n¹⁹ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n²⁰ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n²¹ Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135\nthe plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers.²² In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed.²³ These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it\n### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power\nThe power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’).²⁴ The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid.²⁵ The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico.²⁶ In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.²⁷\nThe contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems.²⁸ The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas).²⁹ The Western Interconnection includes\nEndress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n22 Endress (n 21).\n23 Kate O’Flaherty, ‘Iranian Hackers Are Going After a Disturbing New Physical Target’ (Forbes 21 November 2019) www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/11/21/iranian-hackers-could-be-going-after-a-disturbing-new-physical-target/#4536d8ba7d2a accessed 14 March 2020.\n24 Andrew Charles Wills, ‘A Background on NERC’ (American Security Project, 30 January 2014) www.americansecurityproject.org/nerc accessed 14 March 2020; see also United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), ‘US Electricity Grid and Markets’ www.epa.gov/greenpower/us-electricity-grid-markets accessed 14 March 2020.\n25 Wills (n 24).\n26 US EPA (n 24).\n27 Ibid.\n28 US EPA (n 24).\n29 Ibid.\nB Monarch\nthe Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas).³⁰ Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas.³¹ These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States.³² For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids.³³ The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’.³⁴ At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid.³⁵ Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked.³⁶ Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.³⁷\nThe smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks.³⁸ To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid.³⁹ With fewer resources than large\n30 Ibid.\n31 Ibid.\n32 Alaska and Hawaii have their own interconnections.

All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software.⁴⁴ It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’.⁴⁵ The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.⁴⁶\nThankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business.⁴⁷ In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA).⁴⁸ Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid.⁴⁹ While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that\n40 Ibid.\n41 Ibid.\n42 Ibid.\n43 Ibid.\n44 Ibid.\n45 Annie I.

To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems.⁵¹ An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it.⁵² This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’.⁵³ A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities.⁵⁴ This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television.⁵⁵ Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring.⁵⁶ It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.⁵⁷\nThe problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.⁵⁸\nThe bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.⁵⁹\n50 Ibid.\n51 David Fickling, ‘Cyber Attacks Make Smart Grids Look Dumb’ (Bloomberg, 17 June 2019) www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-17/argentina-blaming-hackers-for-outage-makes-smart-grids-look-dumb accessed 14 March 2020.\n52 Dan O’Shea, ‘LG Introduces Smart Refrigerator with Amazon Alexa-Enabled Grocery Ordering’ (RetailDive.com, 4 January 2017) www.retaildive.com/news/lg-introduces-smart-refrigerator-with-amazon-alexa-enabled-grocery-ordering/433366 accessed 14 March 2020.\n53 Fickling (n 51).\n54 Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, ‘Smart Meter Q&amp;A’ www.puc.state.pa.us/General/consumer_ed/pdf/13_Smart%20Meters.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n55 Ibid.\n56 Ibid.\n57 Ibid.\n58 Ibid.\n59 Christopher Bosch, ‘Securing the Smart Grid: Protecting National Security and Privacy Through Mandatory, Enforceable Interoperability Standards’ (March 2016) 41(4) Fordham Urban Law Journal 1352.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139\nFinally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER).⁶⁰ The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’.⁶¹ The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.⁶²\nAmong the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets.⁶³ Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year.⁶⁴ At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.⁶⁵\nThe Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency\n⁶⁰ United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n⁶⁴ Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁶⁵ See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report (March 2020) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nservices.⁶⁶ Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern.⁶⁷ This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities.⁶⁸ Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’.⁶⁹ It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.⁷⁰\nCybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications.⁷¹ Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers.⁷² Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense).⁷³ Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n⁶⁶ See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n⁶⁷ Ibid.\n⁶⁸ Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n⁶⁹ Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁷⁰ Carr (n 10).\n⁷¹ Ibid.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76\nFor purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation\n### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem\nIt is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber\n74 See generally Richard Clarke, *Cyber War – The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It* (Harper Collins 2010).\n75 Benjamin Monarch, ‘One Minute to Midnight: Amending the War Powers Resolution to Confront the Coming Cyber Wars’ (2015) 103 Kentucky Law Journal 462; Booz Allen Hamilton, ‘When the Lights Went Out: A Comprehensive Review of the 2015 Attacks on Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure’ www. boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out. pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n76 National Intelligence Council, *Global Trends 2025* (U.S. Government Printing Office 2008) 97.\nB Monarch\nattacks.⁷⁷ To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers).⁷⁸ The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour.⁷⁹ Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.⁸⁰\nRobert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’.⁸¹ He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used.⁸² Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states.⁸³ Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master.⁸⁴ This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.⁸⁵\nIt may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016.⁸⁶ The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down.⁸⁷ Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.⁸⁸\nIn the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for\n77 Andy Greenberg, ‘Here’s the Evidence that Links Russia’s Most Brazen Attacks’ (Wired Magazine, 15 November 2019) www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-cyberattack-links accessed 14 March 2020; Michael Imeson, ‘Russia Cyber Aggression Fuels Tensions with West’ (Financial Times, 13 October 2019) www.ft.com/content/0aa7a6e0-ca52-11e9-af46-b09e8bf60c0 accessed 14 March 2020.\n78 Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, ‘Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (18 March 2016) https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf\n79 Ibid.\n80 Michael Assante, ‘Confirmation of a Coordinated Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid’ (SANS Blog, 6 January 2016) https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-a-coordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid\n81 Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired.com, 3 August 2016) www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid accessed 14 March 2020.\n82 Ibid.\n83 Ibid.\n84 Kim Zetter, ‘Everything We Know About Ukraine’s Power Plant Hack’ (Wired Magazine, 20 January 2016) www.wired.com/2016/01/everything-we-know-about-ukraines-power-plant-hack accessed 14 March 2020.\n85 Monarch (n 75).\n86 Kim Zetter, ‘The Ukrainian Power Grid was Attacked Again’ (VICE, 10 January 2017) www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report accessed 14 March 2020.\n87 Ibid.\n88 Ibid.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143\ncyber warfare tools and tactics.⁸⁹ Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:\n‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.⁹⁰\nWhile it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’.⁹¹ To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack.⁹² Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence.⁹³ Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants.⁹⁴ The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant.⁹⁵ Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies).⁹⁶ It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the\n⁸⁹ Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁰ Ibid.\n⁹¹ Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹² Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹³ Ibid.\n⁹⁴ Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁵ Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁶ Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nwill is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence\nThere is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities ...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101\nAt a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital\n97 FERC News Release, ‘FERC Strengthens Cyber Security Standards for Bulk System’ (20 June 2019) www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2019/2019-2/06-20-19-E-2.asp#.Xm2esy2ZM0Q; CriticalInfrastructureProtectionReliabilityStandardCIP-008-6 accessed 14 March 2020.\n98 Ibid; Environment and Energy Bloomberg, ‘INSIGHT: New FERC Cyber Rules May Push Companies to Revise Plans’ (14 August 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/insight-new-ferc-cyber-rules-may-push-companies-to-revise-plans accessed 14 March 2020.\n99 Christian Vasquez, ‘Feds Band Against Energy Hackers as Ransom Threat Rises’ (EnergyWire, 4 February 2020) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1062258033 accessed 14 March 2020.\n100 Ibid.\n101 Mohana Ravindranath, ‘27 Separate Federal Programs Protect Power Grid’ (Nextgov.com, 27 February 2017) www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2017/02/27-separate-federal-programs-protect-power-grid/135740 accessed 14 March 2020.\n102 Robert Walton, ‘Senate Passes Cybersecurity Bill to Decrease Grid Digitization, Move toward Manual Control’ (Utility Dive, 1 July 2019) www.utilitydive.com/news/senate-passes-cybersecurity-bill-to-decrease-grid-digitization-move-toward/557959 accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145\nsystems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe.¹⁰³ Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.¹⁰⁴\nAt a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system).¹⁰⁵ Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies.¹⁰⁶ Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’.¹⁰⁷ Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’.¹⁰⁸ The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy.¹⁰⁹ In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.¹¹⁰\nBeyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort\n¹⁰³ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁹ Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ (September 2018) https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁰ The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch\nis the Stuxnet computer virus.¹¹¹ This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction.¹¹² To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack\n### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step\nBuilding on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.¹¹³\nLastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script\n---\n¹¹¹ Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n¹¹² *Ibid.*\n¹¹³ Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147\namong many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering:¹¹⁴ In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’.¹¹⁵ An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit.¹¹⁶ The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations.¹¹⁷ While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates\n¹¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹¹⁵ Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n¹¹⁶ Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker\nsubsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been\ndemonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between\nthe facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration\nIf a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To\navoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions ... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future\n### 5.1. An insurance programme\nCyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153\nattack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages.¹²⁴ This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism.¹²⁵ This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century.¹²⁶ Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018.¹²⁷ This figure is expected to rise.¹²⁸ Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties\n¹²⁴ Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹²⁵ Ibid.\n¹²⁶ Ibid.\n¹²⁷ Ibid.\n¹²⁸ Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch\nmust be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors\nBeyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’.¹²⁹ Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions.¹³⁰ There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry.¹³¹ If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth\n¹²⁹ William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁰ Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³¹ Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring\nAn integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy\nAs discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the\nB Monarch\nsmaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^^\n## 5.5. Activate university research and development\nOne of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^^ Federal funding at a\n^ Govindarasu (n 33).\n^ University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157\nuniversity level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation\nThe grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^^\n135 Bosch (n 59).\n136 Ibid.\nB Monarch\nSometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.¹³⁷\nIt is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide.¹³⁸ The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on.¹³⁹ These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.¹⁴⁰\nThe disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war')\nThe previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n¹³⁷ Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁸ Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁹ Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁴⁰ Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159\nFirst, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle\nIn the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that\n160 B Monarch\nwould have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life."

Email: benlmonarch@gmail.com (Received 9 February 2020; final version received 15 March 2020) Industries and governments across the world are confronting an ever-growing wave of cyber attacks. Few industries are as vulnerable to these attacks, while simultaneously being indispensable to modern life, as public utilities. Among public utilities the electric grid ranks supreme in its importance to everyday activities, and yet it is under daily siege by actors aiming to cripple it. Should a grid attack of significant magnitude come to fruition, the effects could be devastating and vast. Accordingly, this issue demands immediate attention. This article highlights the urgent nature of this challenge and makes recommendations that should go into effect immediately as a means to mitigate large-scale disruption of the electric grid.\n# 1. Introduction ## 1.1. Grid failure – what it is and why it matters In the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is experiencing rolling blackouts.¹ Yet even in prolonged power outages, we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will return to normal. Perhaps we need ask, however, what if power cannot be restored in a timely manner? Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: how did we reach a point where something so critical to routine life now ¹ David Roberts, ‘California’s Deliberate Blackouts Were Outrageous and Harmful. They’re Going to Happen Again’ (Vox, 24 October 2019) www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/16/20910947/climate-change-wildfires-california-2019-blackouts accessed 14 March 2020.\n© 2020 International Bar Association Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group B Monarch presents an existential threat, and what can we do to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack?\nThis article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart catastrophic grid failure – a paradigm that recognises the inextricable link between commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry. Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial control systems; third, institute a federally mandated information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors, engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for promoting grid integrity.² In this regard, lawyers who represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced before.\n## 1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world ‘Black start’, not to be confused with the term ‘blackout’, is the name given to the process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown.³ At first glance, Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 133 this description is unremarkable, but it implies a disturbing catch-22 – how might one restore power if the entire external transmission network is compromised?\nIf an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These micro considerations hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their ‘black start’ is a quick and effective process for restoring power. But what happens, at a macro level, when an electric grid supplying power to large portions of the United States goes black, or worse, what happens if all of the United States’ electric grids go down simultaneously?⁴ In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and transmitted to turn the United States’ lights back on? Moreover, how might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps the more ominous question is not how, but whether or not we can survive such circumstances if they persist in the long term.\nThe United States electric grid (‘the grid’) is the ‘largest interconnected machine’ in the world.⁵ It consists of more than 7000 power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.⁶ The scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors; many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming code.⁷ Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.⁸ The vastness of the grid makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.\nBy any measure, grid failure will unleash a parade of horrors. Stores would close, food scarcity would follow, communication would cease, garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded, clean water would become a luxury, service stations would yield no fuel, hospitals would eventually go dark, financial transactions would stop, and this is only the tip of the iceberg – in a prolonged grid failure social chaos would reign, once-eradicated diseases would re-emerge and, increasingly, hope of returning to a normal life would fade.⁹ The notion of complete grid failure, once relegated to B Monarch science fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not only possible but also one of the most pressing national security threats today.¹⁰ Attacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke Energy Corporation, one of the United States’ largest electricity producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its utility systems.¹¹ Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million customers in six states.¹² Aside from the obvious risk that a successful breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security upgrades.¹³ Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of electric utility companies are infected by malware.¹⁴ Perhaps one the most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a Kansas nuclear facility was hacked – the perceived purpose of the hack remains either unknown or undisclosed.¹⁵ Thus far, intrusions into United States grid assets have not resulted in damage to such facilities (or, at least, such an event has not been disclosed). These events are often classified as ‘surveillance’ tactics, not disruptive.¹⁶ However, evidence abounds of utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In 2015, a ‘Russian intelligence unit shut off power to hundreds of thousands of people in western Ukraine’.¹⁷ Although the power was only off for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States utilities.¹⁸ A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the results were similar to those of the 2015 attack.¹⁹ However, the sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved noticeably.²⁰ Events like this are not unique to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017.²¹ That breach focused on the safety control system of ¹⁰ See generally Jeffrey Carr, *Inside Cyber Warfare* (2nd edn, O’Reilly Media 2011); Council on Foreign Relations, ‘CFR Survey: Disruptive Cyber Attack a Top Concern in 2020’ (18 December 2019) www.cfr.org/news-releases/cfr-survey-disruptive-cyberattack-top-concern-2020 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹ Rebecca Kern, ‘Duke Energy Hit by 650M Cyber Attempts to Breach Systems in 2017’ (*Bloomberg Environment*, 13 July 2018) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹² *Ibid.* ¹³ *Ibid.* ¹⁴ Carlos Anchondo, ‘Report: 1 in 10 Utilities Hit by Malware’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 3 July 2019) https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/duke-energy-hit-by-650m-cyber-attempts-to-breach-systems-in-2017 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁵ Andy Greenberg, ‘Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls’ (*Wired Magazine*, 6 September 2017) www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁶ David Sanger, ‘US Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ *The New York Times* (15 June 2019) www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁷ *Ibid*; United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability *Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity* www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f51/DOE%20Multiyear%20Plan%20for%20Energy%20Sector%20Cybersecurity%20_0.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁸ Sanger (n 16).\n¹⁹ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5); United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n²⁰ Govindarasu and Hahn (n 5).\n²¹ Blake Sobczak, ‘Hacking Threat Puts Oil Firms at “High Risk”’ (*Energy &amp; Environment News*, 1 August 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060819861 accessed 14 March 2020; Alex Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 135 the plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale destruction and/or deaths of plant workers.²² In the past several weeks, reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been disclosed.²³ These are just a few publicised incidents, and they illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences facing industrial nations. Should an attack akin to the Ukraine intrusion come to fruition in the United States, the results could be catastrophic in scope.\nIn light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start. Blackouts are troubling in their own right, but the crux of this entire topic rests on one overarching concern – when faced with a black start, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A blackout lasting a few hours is very different from a blackout that lasts weeks or months. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the immense challenges that would surely follow.\nIn the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.\n## 2. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it ### 2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power The power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the ‘North American Grid’).²⁴ The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) governs the North American Grid.²⁵ The North American Grid includes two major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico.²⁶ In effect, the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection networks.²⁷ The contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three distinct grid systems.²⁸ The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas).²⁹ The Western Interconnection includes Endress, ‘Deloitte’s Hacking Report Underscores Cybersecurity Threat to Oil and Gas Companies’ (World Oil Magazine, 12 July 2017) www.worldoil.com/blog/2017/07/deloitte-s-hacking-report-underscores-cybersecurity-threat-to-oil-and-gas-companies accessed 14 March 2020.\n\nB Monarch the Rocky Mountain States, portions of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean (excluding Texas).³⁰ Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) covers most of Texas.³¹ These interconnections make up the electric power system of the contiguous United States.³² For purposes of considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase ‘grid failure’ is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of them.\nEach of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the ‘bulk power system, often referred to as the “transmission grid,”’ and the smaller distribution grids.³³ The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid. ‘It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles’.³⁴ At this macro level of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level, most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent safeguards across large swathes of the grid.³⁵ Collaboration among utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient, and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to disruption.\nThe bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked.³⁶ Second, an attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against cyber intrusion.³⁷ The smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily manage these smaller distribution networks.³⁸ To put this in some context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of those oversee small portions of the overall grid.³⁹ With fewer resources than large Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 137 public utilities as well as fewer regulatory safeguards, small utilities companies are less equipped to thwart cyber attacks.⁴⁰ Hackers, notably those connected with Russia, have taken notice of this fact and have exploited smaller, weaker utilities.⁴¹ These utilities ‘have trouble finding sufficiently skilled workers who understand how the computerized and physical components of the grid work together and how to protect them’.⁴² Although bigger utility companies often establish best cyber defence practices, smaller utility companies either cannot afford or are not inclined to adopt those protections.⁴³ The only upside when assessing the vulnerabilities of smaller distribution grids is that if an attack is limited to a single, minor grid, then the attack will likely have fewer negative consequences.\nWhile efforts are underway to promote better cyber defence management across the entire grid, small or large, another element of power generation and distribution poses a risk: the grid component supply chain. All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment and software.⁴⁴ It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China. Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect, give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety equipment. This type of intrusion is known as ‘phoning home’.⁴⁵ The burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.⁴⁶ Thankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United States business.⁴⁷ In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS’ authority by passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA).⁴⁸ Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review transactions that may impact ‘critical infrastructure’ such as the grid.⁴⁹ While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that B Monarch lack an investment component.⁵⁰ Thus, utility companies, large and small, continue to rely on technology from third-party vendors that may contain exploitive features that permit grid disruption.\nIn effect, the United States grid is a patchwork quilt of digital and physical technology from innumerable sources. To provide absolute cyber defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it perfectly.\nTo add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ is used to describe physical devices that are linked to Internet communication systems.⁵¹ An example of an Internet of Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it.⁵² This may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.\nIn the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments often come in the form of so-called ‘smart meters’.⁵³ A smart meter is a device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays that information back to consumers and/or utilities.⁵⁴ This is done through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload function of a smart television.⁵⁵ Smart meters also have the ability to decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand monitoring.⁵⁶ It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be installed worldwide by 2022.⁵⁷ The problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.⁵⁸ The bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to transform the ‘largest interconnected machine in the world’ into a machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater security, rather than less.⁵⁹ Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 139 Finally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal agency responsible for regulating the nation’s electricity generation and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (OEDER).⁶⁰ The OEDER works in coordination with other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it spearheads the Department of Energy’s planning and implementation of grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security Cybersecurity (‘plan’), released in March 2018, details how the federal government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers – notably, however, the plan states that ‘energy owners and operators have the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of risk’.⁶¹ The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.⁶² Among the Department of Energy’s various grid security concerns, one overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks generated an average direct cost per company of $27 million per year, which is added on top of the $150 million to $800 million spent by the average utility to protect its assets.⁶³ Moreover, these costs are increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year.⁶⁴ At the present time, there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to nationalise grid security protocols.⁶⁵ The Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be a national security issue related to defending the United States from a potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and a burden placed on emergency ⁶⁰ United States Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery &amp; Energy Reliability (n 17).\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid. Much of the cost incurred during a cybercrime can be financially difficult to measure because the vast majority of it is unquantifiable reputation damage (assuming the attack is even publicly disclosed at all). The cost reflected here falls into one of four categories: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damages. If companies faced stronger liability for negligent data breaches, then this figure would be much higher. However, when we are talking about data theft the measurable cost to the company is relatively minor because they aren’t really losing anything; they still have a record of the data that is stolen and the cyber attacker gets a copy of it. For example, if a credit card company is attacked and the attack results in the theft of 400 million credit card accounts, the credit card company will still have those accounts, but they may have to issue press statements, reverse charges, etc. Now, the broader economic losses to costumers, corporate goodwill, etc, would be very high, but difficult to measure.\n⁶⁴ Kelly Bissell and Larry Ponemon, ‘The Cost of Cybercrime, Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study: Unlocking the Value of Improved Cybersecurity Protection’ (Accenture Security) www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-96/accenture-2019-cost-of-cybercrime-study-final.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁶⁵ See generally United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission Report https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryMCIL_dZ30QyjFqFkkf10MxIXJGT4yv/view accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch services.⁶⁶ Due to these concerns, federal management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern.⁶⁷ This is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life. It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and social normalcy.\n## 2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?\nCyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities.⁶⁸ Because of this feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack, but Merriam-Webster defines it as ‘an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm’.⁶⁹ It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.⁷⁰ Cybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for their lack of national security implications.⁷¹ Frequently, the tools of the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they stole 130 million credit card numbers.⁷² Similarly, ongoing acts of Chinese cyber espionage, known as ‘Titan Rain’, have resulted in extensive data collection from federal government systems (including, but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense).⁷³ Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.\n⁶⁶ See also Williams and Bennett (n 9); Gray (n 9).\n⁶⁷ Ibid.\n⁶⁸ Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown Publishers 2014).\n⁶⁹ Cyber attack definition www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberattack accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁷⁰ Carr (n 10).\n⁷¹ Ibid. Hacktivism is the act of computer hacking to express political or sociological beliefs.

A caveat to this point, however, is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However, the National Intelligence Council Report *Global Trends 2025* made a distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the battlefield of traditional military targets: ‘Cyber and sabotage attacks on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent [United States] strengths on the battlefield and attack directly [United States] interests at home’.76 For purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council’s reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation – our ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber threat into a potential existential threat.\n## 3. The current situation ### 3.1. Global order vs global mayhem It is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic paranoia?\nThe topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to execute large-scale cyber B Monarch attacks.⁷⁷ To answer the question of whether electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible threat, we start with Ukraine.\nThe first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015, when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers).⁷⁸ The outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000 individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half hour.⁷⁹ Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power, which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent affected customers from reporting power outages.⁸⁰ Robert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine attack was ‘brilliant’.⁸¹ He went on to highlight that the attack was sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools used.⁸² Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation states.⁸³ Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor, including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming their former Soviet master.⁸⁴ This highlights a recurring problem with cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to attribute blame to the responsible party.⁸⁵ It may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a year later, in 2016.⁸⁶ The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the 2015 shut down.⁸⁷ Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a ‘demonstration of capabilities’ than an attack meant to cripple Ukraine’s grid.⁸⁸ In the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a testing ground for Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 143 cyber warfare tools and tactics.⁸⁹ Since 2016, Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force: ‘Ukraine is [a] live-fire space’, says Kenneth Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who advises NATO’s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in Ukraine to study the country’s cyber conflict. Much like global powers [that] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for global influence.⁹⁰ While it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.\nContemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, said that attacks ‘got to the point where they could have thrown switches’.⁹¹ To this day, the grid is still under frequent attack.⁹² Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence.⁹³ Attempts to infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to attacks on nuclear power plants.⁹⁴ The plant in question – the Wolf Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas – suffered intrusions into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant.⁹⁵ Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact. However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.\nThe testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the United States military (and its NATO allies).⁹⁶ It remains merely speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is evident that the ⁸⁹ Lauren Cerulus, ‘How Ukraine Became a Test Bed for Cyber Weaponry’ (Politico, 14 February 2019) www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁰ Ibid.\n⁹¹ Julia Pyper, ‘Russian Hackers Breach US Utility Network via Trusted Vendors’ (Greentech Media, 24 July 2018) www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/russian-hackers-us-utility-power-grid-trusted-vendors accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹² Lily Hay Newman, ‘Russian Hackers Haven’t Stopped Probing the US Power Grid’ (Wired Magazine, 28 November 2018) www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹³ Ibid.\n⁹⁴ Nash Jenkins, ‘Feds: Russian Hackers Are Attacking US Power Plants’ (TIME Magazine, 16 March 2018) https://time.com/5202774/russia-hacking-dhs-report-power accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁵ Blake Sobczak, ‘Feds to Review Nuclear Plant Hit by Hackers’ (Energy &amp; Environment News, 22 March 2019) www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060127921?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eenews.net%2Fstories%2F1060127921 accessed 14 March 2020.\n⁹⁶ Andrew Phillips, ‘The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare’ (USNI News, 14 October 2012) https://news.usni.org/2012/10/14/asymmetric-nature-cyber-warfare accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch will is present and the methods are growing more sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.\n## 3.2. What the United States is doing now – offence and defence There is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers, and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC to report cybersecurity attacks that ‘compromise or attempt to compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters’.97 While this is certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.\nIn addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The purpose of Pathfinder is to ‘advance information sharing, improve training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint operational preparedness and response activities...’.100 In addition to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some form of failure.101 At a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 145 systems, then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe.¹⁰³ Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the use of backup manual controls.¹⁰⁴ At a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid security. This is particularly important because much of the power distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction (the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system).¹⁰⁵ Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups, promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the pack in implementing cyber defence policies.¹⁰⁶ Should this trend continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal level.\nLastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, ‘We need to do more than play goal line defense. As such, the department’s 2018 Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own virtual boundaries’.¹⁰⁷ Secretary Esper elaborated that to ‘defend forward’ means to ‘disrupt threats at the initial source before they reach our networks and systems’.¹⁰⁸ The government has articulated this point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy.¹⁰⁹ In the former, the Trump administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover, the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence arrangements that have been used in more traditional military contexts.¹¹⁰ Beyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to suggest that the United States government has already used cyber weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The most well-documented instance of such an effort ¹⁰³ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Daniel Shea, ‘Cybersecurity and the Electric Grid: The State Role in Protecting Critical Infrastructure’ (NCSL, 24 January 2020) www.ncsl.org/research/energy/cybersecurity-and-the-electric-grid-the-state-role-in-protecting-critical-infrastructure.aspx accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Jim Garamone, ‘Esper Describes DOD’s Increased Cyber Offensive Strategy’ (US Department of Defense, 20 September 2019) www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1966758/esper-describes-dods-increased-cyber-offensive-strategy accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁰⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁹ Taylor Armerding, ‘US Vows to Go on Cyber Offense’ (Forbes, 28 September 2018) www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/09/28/u-s-vows-to-go-on-cyber-offense/#42cdbad87e19 accessed 14 March 2020; The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy’ https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4916949/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf; Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, 2018 available at https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁰ The White House (n 109).\nB Monarch is the Stuxnet computer virus.¹¹¹ This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produce weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of self destruction.¹¹² To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to strike at the core of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet, then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of cyber weaponry.\n## 4. Anatomy of an attack ### 4.1. A grid attack, step by step Building on the information discussed in the prior sections of this article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.\nIt is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company should know that marketing materials for the company should never include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the critical infrastructure report titled *When the Lights Went Out*, published by Booz Allen Hamilton.¹¹³ Lastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is but one script --- ¹¹¹ Zetter, *Countdown* (n 68).\n¹¹² *Ibid.* ¹¹³ Hamilton (n 75). For those interested in a deeper analysis of these factors at an engineering level, please see the publication.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 147 among many that a utility cyber attack could follow. Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet clearly envisioned.\n(1) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering:¹¹⁴ In advance of an attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility, perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore, develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny employees use of personal email or similar applications while using facility networks, etc.\n(2) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as ‘living off the land’.¹¹⁵ An infamous example of this occurred in 2017 when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the EternalBlue exploit.¹¹⁶ The malware gained from EternalBlue has been used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations.¹¹⁷ While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of malware that are available and test those exploits against their own systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations against known malware threats.\n(3) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote access trojan (‘RAT’) or some similar software to the business network. The business network is distinct from the network that controls industrial operation systems because the business network is where routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates ¹¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹¹⁵ Newman, ‘Russian Hackers’ (n 92).\n¹¹⁶ Edward Moyer, ‘Stolen NSA Hacking Tool Now Victimizing US Cities Report Says’ (CNET, 25 May 2019) www.cnet.com/news/stolen-nsa-hacking-tool-now-victimizing-us-cities-report-says accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹¹⁷ Ibid.\nelectricity generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network, which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.\n(4) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often through a ‘social engineering' method of attack because it exploits human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be sending what appears to be an email from an employee's friend, spouse, etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and file monitoring on the corporate network.\n(5) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid facility's corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker's activities.\n(6) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware, the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a recording device on an employee's computer that records each keyboard input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker. Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware detection software.\n(7) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins, the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption of the grid and the attack's ability to navigate network traffic largely undetected. In effect, the attacker subsumes the grid control authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to alter conditions of the industrial control network.\n(8) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers, employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed, this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.\n(9) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the facility's power generation and distribution network. An industrial control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor, interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the facility's operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal, presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that an attacker's efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has been demonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as secure as it may seem in theory.\n(10) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either the corporate or the industrial control system network during the malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine before being executed against their actual target.\n(11) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system's operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.\n(12) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation. During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the corporate and/or industrial control system networks.\n(13) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the breakers within the facility's power generation and distribution system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive procedures.\n(14) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts power converters and cuts communication between the facility control centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.\n(15) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level, measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption, only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering legitimate from fraudulent calls.\n(16) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes relevant as the attacker's prescheduled power outages begin to wreak havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic situation.\n(17) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted, control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover, with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.\n(18) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy the disruption. Under this scenario, power could only be restored by installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.\n### Post-mortem or restoration If a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked down a large number of power lines. Because of the inoperable power lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began backing up. To avoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area's water supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many challenges resulting from lost power. This grave concern prompted Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s urban systems department to remark, ‘Millions... could be left with no electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal for weeks (or even months).... No one can protect critical urban infrastructure on their own'.\nCombined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from Germany. Expand a situation of this type across an entire grid system, and it could take years to return all systems to normal working order. This sort of dismal situation is known as a black start, and it could prove extremely difficult to overcome. Moreover, one need to only look at the present challenges created by the COVID-19 viral pandemic to appreciate how delicate these critical infrastructure systems are when placed under unexpected and severe stress. An attack on the grid resulting in prolonged power loss would in many ways mirror, and in some ways far exceed, the disruptions presently occurring as a result of the virus pandemic.\nA black start situation is one where power must be restored under circumstances where available power is already limited. It is akin to jumping a car battery by directing power from a live battery to the dead battery using jumper cables. Under the direst of grid attack scenarios, there may be too few live batteries, so to speak, to restore power swiftly before second-order effects begin unfolding. Thus, anyone tasked with mitigating a cyber attack against the grid must recognise that it is equally important to prepare for the possibility of a successful cyber attack. Consideration of the kinds of preparations needed for what comes in the wake of a successful cyber attack against the grid go far beyond the scope of this article; however, they should be given concern by the reader. Ultimately, the aim of any grid defence policy is to avoid a black start scenario, but it is critical to develop protocols both on a policy level and at an engineering level to extricate those affected by an attack as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the task of restoring power may become subsumed by larger social and economic implications.\n## 5. Attack mitigation and the future ### 5.1. An insurance programme Cyber attacks, in particular those that compromise critical infrastructure like the grid, are costly. The losses to consumers and/or business impacted by a cyber Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 153 attack may be measured in the billions of dollars. For instance, the NotPetya cyber attack, which was a form of ransomware that emerged in 2017 principally in Ukraine but with effects felt globally, resulted in approximately $10 billion in worldwide damages.¹²⁴ This is troubling for three reasons: first, economic damages can result in the bankruptcy of companies instrumental to any number of life's facets; second, if a company survives the monetary toll of a cyber attack, it will often pass along these damages and the cost of corrective measures to consumers; and, third, inflicting economic damage is an incentive on the part of a cyber aggressor to pursue cyber warfare in the first place.\nInstituting a policy that both ameliorates financial losses from cyber attacks and mitigates the incentive to commence them is a prudent measure. In light of the scale of potential economic damages caused by cyber attacks, the only entity with the wherewithal to absorb such losses is likely the federal government. The risk posed by cybersecurity attacks, particularly those aimed at the grid and other critical infrastructure, are not dissimilar to the sorts of risks that emerged following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the federal government enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to provide a backstop to private insurers in the event of losses resulting from catastrophic terrorism.¹²⁵ This was an important response to the 9/11 attacks because acts of war exclusions, ie losses suffered as a result of war-making activities, have been common to insurance contracts for over a century.¹²⁶ Thus, if cyber attacks cannot be shown to fall within an act of war exclusion for purposes of insurance coverage, the insured parties must bear the burden of those losses without an insurance backstop.\nCyber attack-related insurance coverage accounted for approximately $2 billion in 2018.¹²⁷ This figure is expected to rise.¹²⁸ Should cyber attacks continue to evolve as they have in recent years, they will increasingly take on the look and feel of war-making activities, particularly those attacks that are attributable to a state sponsor. The federal government can bolster the private insurance market and strengthen the resiliency of the companies comprising critical infrastructure, such as the grid, by becoming a financial backstop. In light of the fact that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is expiring in 2020, it makes the most sense to renew it and amend it to expand coverage for cyber attack risk.\nThis approach will not be without obstacles, however. Cyber attacks can be difficult to measure in scope, and frequently the responsible party and that party's motivation for the attack are challenging to discern. For instance, if a company is hacked and that hack results in a ransom of private user data, and the company pays the ransom but cannot show that the attack was anything more than common thievery, then should that company be eligible for federal insurance? The most likely answer is no. In order to qualify for insurance payouts, backed by the federal government, insured parties ¹²⁴ Aaron Klein and Scott Anderson, ‘A Federal Backstop for Insuring Against Cyberattacks?’ (*Brookings Institute*, 27 September 2019) www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/09/27/a-federal-backstop-for-insuring-against-cyberattacks accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹²⁵ Ibid.\n¹²⁶ Ibid.\n¹²⁷ Ibid.\n¹²⁸ Doug Olenick, ‘Cyber Insurance Premium Costs Rise 5 Percent for 2019, Despite Increased Attacks’ (*SC Media*, 19 September 2019) www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/cyber-insurance-premium-costs-rise-5-percent-for-2019-despite-increased-attacks accessed 14 March 2020.\nB Monarch must be able to demonstrate that the attack was the result of a military aim (or at least an effort to gain geopolitical advantage). For critical infrastructure entities, like grid operating facilities, this would not be a hard argument to make because infrastructure like the grid is so critical to modern life that attacks against it would almost invariably constitute a national security breach.\n## 5.2. More warriors Beyond mitigating the financial strain of a grid attack, we must focus on rapidly and dramatically expanding our defensive workforce. Presently, the United States has about 720,000 cybersecurity workers, and while this may seem like a large number it leaves a shortfall of approximately 314,000 workers. According to a survey conducted by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, ‘[information technology] decision makers across eight countries found that 82 percent of employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills and 71 percent believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their organizations’.¹²⁹ Moreover, it is expected that by 2022 the scale of the cybersecurity workforce shortage will be nearly 1.8 million unfilled positions.¹³⁰ There is simply no way to adequately defend the grid, and the rest of our digital vulnerabilities, with a cyber workforce that is lacking.\nThe nature of cyber threats is that they grow in number and sophistication in a nonlinear fashion, whereas hiring individuals to combat cyber attacks is limited by linear patterns. In other words, even if hiring occurs at a rate that results in a surplus of cybersecurity workers, the growing scale of the threat will still frequently outpace it. Yet we are presently nowhere near a surplus of employees, and it is crippling our ability to confront the possibility of large-scale grid disruption.\nPublic resources must be immediately directed to the education and training of cybersecurity workers. Computer engineering has been in ascendance as a profession for many years, but emphasis on cybersecurity has typically taken a back seat to emphasis on software development. In the survey discussed above, the same information technology decision makers indicated that only about one in four education programmes prepared students to enter the cybersecurity industry.¹³¹ If the United States is to prepare for the present and growing danger of major social disruption resulting from a grid failure, then it must put more boots on the ground. Federal grant programmes, increased training, employer incentives, tax credits for cybersecurity trainees and so on are essential. Although most of these individuals will not serve in the United States military, their jobs will be in large measure critical to the national security of the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the government recently rolled out a Cyber Retraining Academy to give individuals – some without any technology experience – the insights, tools and methods needed to help bridge the workforce gap. The United States government would be wise to follow the lead of its North Atlantic cousin by expanding the depth ¹²⁹ William Crumpler, ‘The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap’ (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 29 January 2019) www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁰ Frost &amp; Sullivan, 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study (2017) https://iamcybersafe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/europe-gisws-report.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³¹ Ibid.\nof the National Centers of Academic Excellence programmes for both cyber defence and cyber operations. The same is true for the United States Cyber Challenge and its high-school-level cybersecurity camps. These programmes warrant dramatic expansion and the requisite funding. In the end, the positions in demand are well-paying jobs that offer the chance to provide meaningful defence from a potentially existential threat, so the employee incentive is notable. However, our information technology workforce must be educated and reoriented so that enterprising technophiles seek to defend their country rather than produce the latest app for dog walking services.\n### Sharing is caring An integral part of defending the grid is to share information about attacks. When cyber attacks first emerged as issues of concern, cyber intrusions were frequently met with an overwhelming urge to keep them quiet and hope that they would go away. As everyone now knows, this is impossible. Thus, many impacted parties are now openly disclosing when they are victims of an attack, and they are seeking assistance from outside parties. This is a dramatic improvement, but more must be done if the grid is to be optimally protected.\nElectric grid operators, regulators, insurance companies and others are beginning to share information on attacks and potential takes. However, a voluntary sharing programme is not ideal. By putting into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), Congress took a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough because the programme is voluntary. Voluntary sharing of information leaves open the possibility that critical information may be withheld. Should critical information be withheld, it will result in a less effective response and a deficient understanding of the threat. That being said, CISA, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does effectively aggregate and communicate threat information.\nThus, this article recommends that CISA be amended to mandate the sharing of information and likewise to impose commercial sanctions on those companies that fail to disclose evidence of a cyber attack. This would remove the discretionary component of information sharing from private entities, streamline their disclosure process and put the federal government in a better informed position. The present situation is akin to not requiring, by law, that medical facilities report cases of highly infectious diseases to the Centers for Disease Control. In the same way that healthcare providers are mandated by law to report to the Centers for Disease Control, critical infrastructure companies, like those managing the grid, should be required by law to report to DHS when they suspect a cyber threat or are victims thereof.\n### Don't forget the little guy As discussed earlier, the bulk power system, which comprises the major utility companies in the United States, is fairly robust in its management of cyber threats. However, the smaller utility companies that do not comprise the bulk power system, known as the B Monarch smaller distribution grids, are lagging significantly in their management of grid attacks. It is proper that the grid’s major players receive the most attention from cybersecurity experts, but left unattended, the small distribution grids will become the desired target of cyber aggressors. In much the same way that security is provided for large-scale terrorist targets, like the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, the major power distributors receive the most concern. While the threat of an attack on a high-profile target is palpable, it is far more likely that softer targets will be struck. The grid can be viewed in much the same way, with one distinct difference: by targeting smaller, less well-defended grid targets, attackers can increase their likelihood of success and increase their understanding of how to strike the bulk power system.\nTo confront this weakness, Congress should expand oversight of the bulk power system to include the smaller distribution network. The present regulatory arrangement creates a two-tiered security scheme wherein the major utility players are closely scrutinised and heavily supported by federal expertise while the small distribution network is left much to its own defences. This type of system unintentionally makes the job of cyber attackers easier because it promotes an image that the most effective way to disrupt the grid is to go after the smaller networks. In other words, if Congress wittingly creates vulnerability in the grid by focusing most of its energy on a certain element of it, it will invite cyber aggressors to strike those soft targets.\nIn addition to expanded oversight, the federal government should subsidise cybersecurity measures for small distribution operators and help them develop a standard protocol for cyber defence. If small distribution networks are brought under the umbrella of a robust federal management system, then attackers will be forced to compete with the cyber expertise provided by the government. However, it is critical to note that although an oversight system and some type of standard operating protocol for threat assessment and defence are warranted, they should not come with requirements to standardise equipment, software, etc. Part of what gives the grid some inherent defence is its complexity and diversity. If the grid becomes more standardised and aggregated, this could make it more fragile because the more interconnected and less diverse the grid becomes the more easily it can be attacked on a large, disruptive scale. Therefore, the federal government must balance oversight that is helpful against requirements that might homogenise the grid to the point of increasing its vulnerability.^[133]^ ## 5.5. Activate university research and development One of the United States’ achievements is its vast, impressive and impactful university system. By subsidising research and development at a university level, the United States greatly enriched its economy and its people during the last half-century. This same system needs to be called upon to meet the challenge of cyber defence, particularly for existential risks like a large-scale grid disruption.\nProgrammes currently exist on this front through the National Science Foundation; however, Congress should act to expand funding in this area.^[134]^ Federal funding at a ^[133] Govindarasu (n 33).\n^[134] University of Arizona, ‘NSF Renews Grant for University of Arizona Cybersecurity Program’ (EurekAlert, 15 October 2019) www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/uoa-nrg101419.php accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 157 university level can take two principal forms. First, individual students can seek scholarships designed exclusively to fund their pursuit of academic credentials in the cybersecurity realm. Second, universities can obtain grants that provide support for entire academic programmes dedicated to both educating cybersecurity specialists and providing the latest research and analysis on cybersecurity threats.\nAside from direct federal funding, the government can provide tax incentives to potential university donors that promote greater emphasis on cybersecurity. Endowment contributions typically come in two forms, either an unrestricted contribution that the university can use towards a project of its choosing or a restricted contribution that must be used by the university according to the dictates of the donor. As most university donations are made to non-profit institutions, they are already tax deductible. However, the federal government can take the step, through the tax code, of providing a tax credit for restricted donations made towards further research and development in the cybersecurity space. This added incentive could provide additional endowment support for the expansion of cybersecurity defence, which by extension will promote stronger cybersecurity defence throughout various economic sectors.\nSome may balk at the notion that preferential treatment is provided to funding cybersecurity measures at the university level. Obviously, money is a finite resource and a dollar dedicated to cybersecurity is a dollar not received by a cancer research facility, a law school an art programme, etc. This is a valid critique of this recommendation. However, unlike the aforementioned departments, and many others, cyber defence research goes to the heart of an existential threat facing Western societies. As discussed in earlier sections, under a worst-case scenario wherein the US electric grid is disrupted for months (or perhaps longer), the consequences could be so dire as to upend even the most common assumptions about daily life. In other words, we should fund cyber defence as if our lives depended on it, because they most likely do.\n## 5.6. New tech – Internet of Things, automation and disaggregation The grid is not a static system; rather, it is evolving technologically every day. This attribute is both a blessing and a curse. It is a curse because it makes securing the grid more difficult, as each protective measure grows obsolete in a short period of time. It is also a curse because it is sometimes hard to imagine how a future grid may operate and what weaknesses it may have. Nonetheless, this situation can be a blessing and an opportunity, because it gives all of those involved with grid security an opportunity to use technology developments to strengthen it. But we must be mindful of using new technology to improve grid security, and regrettably that is not occurring presently.\nThere is much talk of a smart grid system being built upon the traditional grid system.^[135]^ This is, in effect, the digitisation and interconnection of the traditional grid into a grid system that more closely resembles the Internet. The smart grid relies on ‘near-instantaneous communication of information’ about grid elements, from the operation of a hydroelectric plant to the energy usage of a home refrigerator.^[136]^ B Monarch Sometimes called the Internet of Things, smart grid devices designed to monitor and control energy supply and demand are spreading rapidly across modern life.¹³⁷ It is anticipated that by 2025 there will be 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide.¹³⁸ The Internet of Things is a large universe, which includes anything from fitness trackers to autonomous farm equipment, but within it is a subset of devices that comprise the smart grid. These devices include connected appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, grid-connected thermostats, lighting systems for homes or businesses and so on.¹³⁹ These devices will be able to communicate energy supply and demand throughout the vast grid, and will interact with the traditional grid in ways that are yet unimaginable. One such imagined world is a future energy cloud system where power generation and distribution occurs across a network that includes sources from traditional power generation like coal-fired plants to home solar power generation, all of which moves across a network of power distribution akin to information technology cloud computing.¹⁴⁰ The disaggregated energy network of the future may offer untold advantages over the existing grid, such as reduced carbon emissions, greater efficiency and new sources of energy. However, without a security protocol in place to drive the development of smart devices, energy clouds, power distribution automation and so on, the cyber threat will loom larger and larger over the grid as we move into this increasingly digital energy network. Therefore, it is essential that the emerging technologies on this front have legally mandated security protocols to ensure their development advances with an eye towards making the grid stronger, not weaker. If the American entrepreneurial spirit builds a smarter grid in the years to come, it will have been in vain if it simply makes a smarter yet more vulnerable grid network. Thus, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to regulate this emerging market in a manner that does not allow innovation to trump security. The time to get this issue right is now, not ten years from now, and failing to do so will only worsen the risk that our grid could suffer a devastating attack.\n## 5.7. Si vis pacem, para bellum ('If you want peace, prepare for war') The previous sections have all highlighted methods that promote cyber defence, but cyber offence is an important consideration when protecting the grid. Continued efforts by the United States military to develop cyber offensive capability can act as a deterrent to any outside aggressor that may be considering an attack on the US grid. However, there are areas for improvement on the offensive side of this issue.\n¹³⁷ Matt Burgess, ‘What Is the Internet of Things?’ (*Wired Magazine*, 16 February 2018) www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁸ Statista Research Department, ‘Internet of Things – Numer of Connected Devices Worldwide 2015–2025’ (27 November 2016) www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹³⁹ Alireza Ghasempour, ‘Internet of Things in Smart Grid: Architecture, Applications, Services, Key Technologies, and Challenges’ (*Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Applied Sciences and Technology, University of Tehran*, 26 March 2019) www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/4/1/22 accessed 14 March 2020.\n¹⁴⁰ Navigant, ‘Energy Cloud 4.0 – Capturing Business Value Through Disruptive Energy Platforms (Q1 2018) www.navigantresearch.com/-/media/project/navigant-research/reportfiles/wpec418navigantresearchpdf.pdf accessed 14 March 2020.\nJournal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law 159 First, cyber warfare is presently a largely undefined realm of military engagement. Moreover, it is largely conducted in secret. These are not helpful characteristics. In order for offensive capabilities to serve as a deterrent to potential grid attacks, cyber aggressors must understand the scope of the United States’ abilities. This situation is not dissimilar to military shows of force, such as displaying the proficiency of new aircraft, disclosing the strength of the nuclear arsenal, establishing bases in tactically relevant locations and so on. If it is known to outside aggressors that the United States military stands ready to launch a far more devastating cyber attack should one be launched against the United States, then the likelihood of such an attack will diminish. On the other hand, if outside parties do not fear the prospect of an American reprisal, then they may feel bolder in their efforts to strike at critical infrastructure such as the grid.\nAlong these same lines, the military must map out clear rules of engagement. Presently, it is unknown what kind of attack would warrant a military response. For instance, should a modest strike against the grid occur, does this warrant an escalated cyber attack against the agitating party (assuming that party can be identified)? Or, perhaps, such a strike would warrant a traditional, kinetic military strike, such as a missile aimed at the aggressor’s critical infrastructure? Another option still is economic sanctions. Some have even suggested that a massive cyber attack against the United States, for example a nationwide grid attack, would warrant a military response that involves nuclear weapons. All of these are possible scenarios in part because it is unclear how the United States will engage should it be the victim of a massive cyber attack. This is not helpful. Most parties know that engaging the United States will result in some kind of a response, but without clear rules of engagement, the world is left open to too much dangerous conjecture and speculation. The Department of Defense should set out immediately to develop a comprehensive set of cyber rules of engagement that complement the existing rules of engagement.\n## 5.8. A never-ending struggle In the end, no list of solutions for confronting the possibility of an existential grid attack is adequate over a long enough time horizon. This threat is evolving daily and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace for years to come – perhaps in perpetuity. As the grid becomes more complex and the threats against it more manifold and numerous, the only appropriate remedy is to invest all necessary resources into forestalling the worst. The stakes are simply too high for the modern way of life to allow even a slight chance of large-scale grid disruption, and yet that is where we find ourselves presently. The grid may not come under attack tomorrow, or even within the next year or decade, but eventually it is likely to be hit in a devastating manner, and we will be forced to confront the prospect of a black start. The toll this may take on our society could be irreparable. Thus, it is important to appreciate that the threat we face is likely not to abate so long as we have a grid that is vulnerable to existential disruption. And it is unlikely we will ever have a fully impregnable grid. We must, therefore, accept the scale of this threat and continue to innovate, through technology and policy, new ways of meeting it.\n## 6. Conclusion The world in the digital age is a dangerous place. Numerous benefits have been bestowed by the technological revolution, but it has also exposed vulnerabilities that would have been unthinkable a generation ago. In no circumstances is this more obvious than in our daily need for electricity. In short, our lives rely on an uninterrupted supply of electricity as much as they rely on clean water. Yes, a lack of clean water will kill us, but a lack of electricity for more than a few days has the potential to destroy nearly every facet of modern life. The electric grid is under a relentless barrage of attacks, and those attacks are growing more sophisticated by the day. It stands to reason that sooner or later, one of these attacks will succeed, and when it does it could throw our society into darkness. Because of the consequences that may unfold in the wake of a grid attack, we must urgently take all necessary steps to mitigate the risk of grid failure. This requires all shareholders of this issue to stay informed, stay alert and invest the time and energy that is warranted to buttress the security of this critical lynchpin of the modern way of life."
