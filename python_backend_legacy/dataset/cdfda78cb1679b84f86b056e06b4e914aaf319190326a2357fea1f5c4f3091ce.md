This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain.² Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications.³ The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same.⁴ Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\n¹Robert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.[5]\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries.[6] These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible.[7] On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n[6] Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance? Conceptions, Causes, and Assessment’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 72–109; and Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’, *Journal of Strategic Studies* 38/1–2 (2015), 4–37.\n[7] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, Libicki, Cyber Deterrence and Cyberwar; Joseph S. Nye, Jr., ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 44–71; and Fischerkeller and Harknett explicitly contend deterrence is not possible subthreshold in cyberspace because of what they identify as inherent attributes of the cyberspace environment.\n[8] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 382.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n537\nimplications for U.S. cyber strategy and call for the United States to implement a strategy of “persistent engagement,” in which it conducts continuous cyber operations to “shape cyberspace ad infinitum to enable U.S. relative autonomy in cyberspace.”9\nConversely, the guardedly optimistic camp sought to refine and caveat the early cyber deterrence literature, salvaging deterrence in cyberspace where possible. For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n9 Ibid., 388.\n10 Schneider, ‘Deterrence in and through Cyberspace’; and Jon Lindsay, et al., ‘Cybersecurity and Cross-Domain Deterrence: The Consequences of Complexity’, Journal of Cybersecurity 1/1 (2015), 53–67.\n11 Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, 58–60; and Henry Farrell and Abraham L.

LONERGAN\ncyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\"¹⁶ Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.¹⁷\nWe build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial.¹⁸ In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial.¹⁹ As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.²⁰\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of\n¹⁶ 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.\n¹⁷ 'Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (February 2017). 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America' (September 2018).\n¹⁸ A similar critique has historically been leveled at deterrence theorists. See, for example, George H. Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima: The Airpower Background of Modern Strategy (Routledge Publishers, 1986).\n¹⁹ Robert J. Art, 'To What Ends Military Power?' International Security 4/4 (1980), 3–35.\n²⁰ 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', U.S. Department of Defense, January 2018.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n539\npunishment is a poor fit for cyberspace.²¹ Second, deterrence by denial, which is at the core of conventional deterrence, contains two distinct components, defense and denial, which the cyber deterrence literature often conflates. We show why these should be differentiated. Finally, conventional deterrence is also distinguished from nuclear deterrence in conceptualizing deterrence outcomes in continuous rather than binary terms.²² This has natural extensions to cyberspace, where outcomes are also more continuous.\n## Denial versus punishment\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.”²³ Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.”²⁴ Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains.²⁵ The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment.²⁶ Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.”²⁷ In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.²⁸\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n²¹ There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n²² However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies. We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for this insight.\n²³ Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 9; and Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2004), 26.\n²⁴ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ However, it is difficult to ascertain whether a given deterrent threat was successful because deterrence has a negative objective. See the following for debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategy during the Cold War: Robert Jervis, *The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984); Lawrence Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy* (London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 1989); Long, *Deterrence*; and Francis J. Gavin, *Nuclear Statecraft: History and Strategy in America’s Atomic Age* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012).\n²⁵ John J. Mearsheimer, ‘Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe’, *International Security* 9/3 (1984), 21.\n²⁶ The addition of deterrence by entanglement and norms did not come until much later and is beyond a pure definition of deterrence, according to Nye in ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’.\n²⁷ John J. Mearsheimer, *Conventional Deterrence* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 14–15.\n²⁸ Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy*, 83.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noperations are perceived to be inordinately costly for an attacking state. $^{29}$  In related formulations, denial is \"preventing battlefield success,\" $^{30}$  and denial strategies aim to \"deny the opponent hope of achieving the disputed territorial objectives. Thus, denial campaigns focus on the target state's military strategy.\" $^{31}$  However, denial succeeds not only when a state can thwart an adversary's military operations, but also when it can target the capabilities on which its military objectives rely as well as its overall military strategy. $^{32}$  While the primary difference between denial and punishment is the nature of the target, there are other important distinctions between these deterrence mechanisms, such as denial being more credible and also calculable because it rests on assessing the deterring state's capabilities more so than its intention. $^{33}$\nWhile the logic of denial has been applied in the nuclear context, it is central to conventional deterrence strategies.[34] Conventional deterrence is \"a function of the capability of denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces.\"[35] Specifically, conventional deterrence works when the attacking states perceives that the probability of achieving its objectives on the battlefield is low and that the costs are likely to be high.[36] In the conventional realm, the efficacy of deterrence is conditional on two variables: first, the costs the attacker would have to pay in material resources, military and civilian casualties, and other related costs associated with the\n29Glenn Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 14-15.\n30Daniel Byman and Matthew Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion: American Foreign Policy and the Limits of Military Might (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 50. Importantly, their discussion of denial is in the context of coercion rather than deterrence, but deterrence is a coercive strategy and has a shared logic.\n31Robert A. Pape, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 19. While this is also a discussion of coercion, the same logic holds for deterrence.\n32Byman and Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion, 79; and Pape, Bombing to Win, 29.\n33Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 15-16; and Samuel P. Huntington makes a similar point in 'Conventional Deterrence and Conventional Retaliation in Europe', International Security 8/3 (1983), 35.\n34For denial in a nuclear context, see, for example, Jack L. Snyder, The Soviet Strategic Culture: Implications for Limited Nuclear Operations (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1977); Colin S. Gray, 'Theater Nuclear Weapons: Doctrines and Postures', World Politics 28/2 (January 1976), 305; Mearsheimer, 'Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe,' and Bernard Brodie's discussion of tactical nuclear weapons in 'The Development of Nuclear Strategy', International Security 2/4 (Spring 1978), 76-78. For conventional deterrence by denial, see, for example, Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence; Colin S. Gray, 'War-Fighting for Deterrence', The Journal of Strategic Studies 7/1 (1984), 5-28. Notably, Huntington argues that conventional deterrence by retaliation is also a viable strategy, which is essentially conventional deterrence by punishment. See Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence,' 36.\n35Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 15. Conventional deterrence is almost always discussed in the context of large-scale ground warfare, but there is some literature on maritime conventional deterrence. See, for example, James J. Wirtz, 'Strategic Conventional Deterrence: Lessons from the Maritime Strategy', Security Studies 3/1 (1993), 117-151. For a discussion of contemporary conventional deterrence, see Karl P. Mueller, 'Conventional Deterrence Redux: Avoiding Great Power Conflict in the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  Century', Strategic Studies Quarterly 12/4 (Winter 2018), 76-93.\n36Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23-24. One challenge with conventional deterrence that Mearsheimer notes is that it is difficult to properly assess the costs of war ex ante. This lays the groundwork for rationalist explanations for war. See, for example, James D. Fearon, 'Rationalist Explanations for War', International Organization 49/3 (1995), 379-414.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n541\nmobilization, deployment, fighting, and maintenance of the force; and second, the probability of success, which is a function of time.³⁷ If an attacker believes he/she has a high probability of achieving victory in a short time span, then he/she is less likely to be deterred. However, if he/she calculates that victory will only be achieved after a protracted conflict, then he/she is more likely to be deterred because of the perceived costs that would accumulate over time.³⁸ Conventional military forces can deter in three ways: simply by their presence, they can increase the opponent's uncertainty about the true costs of war; by enabling defense, the attacker may calculate that he/she cannot achieve his/her military objectives at a reasonable cost; and by the threat of retaliation.³⁹ While the balance of forces plays an important role in conventional deterrence calculations, success is also a function of military strategy.⁴⁰\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.”⁴¹ Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.”⁴² While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.⁴³\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense).⁴⁴ This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n³⁷ Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n³⁸ Ibid., 24.\n³⁹ Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n⁴⁰ In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n⁴¹ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n⁴² Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n⁴³ Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n⁴⁴ Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36. Huntington notes that many people neglect the distinction between the concepts of 'defense' and 'retaliation' on page 37 of his work.\n47Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78-79.\n48Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, 'Deterrence: The Elusive Dependent Variable', World Politics 42/3 (1990), 336-369; and Paul Huth and Bruce Russett, 'Deterrence Failure and Crisis Escalation', International Studies Quarterly 32/1 (1998), 29-45.\n49Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 11.\n50Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n543\ndeterrence but, rather, part of making it succeed.⁵¹ Therefore, for conventional deterrence, the objective could be defined as, “reduc[ing] the probability of enemy military attacks,” and denial works by affecting the adversary’s “probability of gaining his objective.”⁵² This is not a binary outcome variable in which there are two possible results – success or failure – but rather, a continuous one in which success or failure is a matter of degree.\n## Deterrence concepts in cyberspace and U.S. cyber strategy\nWithin the United States, cyber academics and practitioners rely on a variety of deterrence frameworks, some of which rest on implicit assumptions about their causal logics and how they relate to traditional deterrence concepts. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance.⁵³ Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace.⁵⁴ Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n⁵¹ Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n⁵² Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n⁵³ We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n⁵⁴ For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58]\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n[55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59]\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62]\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some\n64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes \"offensive cyber operations\" to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nactors. $^{69}$  The history of cyber conflict largely bears out this argument – most “malicious cyber activity has taken place far below the threshold of armed conflict between states, and has not risen to the level that would trigger such a conflict.” $^{70}$\nThe types of offensive cyber operation that, at a conceptual level, could generate punishment-level costs would be a cyber attack targeting civilian critical infrastructure that is essential to the functioning of a society.[71] However, it stretches credulity that the offensive employment of cyber power could generate the costs necessary for an effective punishment strategy. Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

Finally, from a U.S. policymaking perspective, the implementation of deterrence by denial has encompassed a range of instruments of national power, ranging from diplomacy to law enforcement. This significantly expands the scope of deterrence by denial mechanisms, which we argue is problematic. Below, we review “defense” approaches to deterrence by denial and discuss their limitations, and then articulate a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace based on “denial.”\n## Defensive approaches to deterrence by denial\nIn depicting deterrence by denial, the cyber academic literature almost universally defines denial as a function of defense.74 For example, Dorothy Denning argues that deterrence by denial offers the most likely prospects for success in cyberspace, focusing on “cyber security mechanisms and practices, including the regular installation of security patches, the use of strong methods for authentication, and the application of firewalls, black and white lists, intrusion prevention systems, antivirus tools, encryption, and so forth.”75 Similarly, Jacquelyn Schneider discusses different means of deterrence by denial in cyberspace, including improving basic cyber hygiene, hardening defenses, and augmenting threat information sharing.76 While Schneider acknowledges that deterrence by denial is technically feasible in some contexts (and certainly more so than deterrence by punishment), she posits that the strategy “by itself might not be able to credibly or effectively deter both low-scale malicious cyberspace activity and more significant cyber attacks.”77 Joseph Nye’s discussion of deterrence by denial focuses on improving resilience in addition to shoring up defenses, the logic being that if a state is more resilient and can withstand and rapidly recover from a cyber attack, it will buttress deterrence by making the attack less appealing in the first place.78\nThis is also paralleled in U.S. policymaking circles. For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M.

LONERGAN\ncybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of \"defend forward\" (the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing \"homeland defense\" to, among other things, \"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing \"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82\nU.S. Cyber Command's \"hunt forward\" and \"malware inoculation\" efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed \"hunt forward\" operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages. See 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.'\n81'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n82'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n83For a full discussion of this topic see Erica D.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n552 E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).”⁹² Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy.⁹³ In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\n⁹²Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\n⁹³Aniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n555\n# A strategy of denial for cyberspace\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense.¹⁰³ In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n¹⁰³ Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n557\nin how the nuclear, rather than conventional, deterrence literature defines the dependent variable. The observance of cyber operations in itself should not be held up as an indication that deterrence has failed.¹⁰⁶ For example, Fischerkeller and Harknett describe deterrence as “a strategy based upon a threat of use of force with an operational objective of avoiding costly operational contact (i.e., the actual use of force).”¹⁰⁷ This is indeed the case for nuclear deterrence. However, as Schelling notes, in the conventional realm deterrence may take the form of “graduated deterrence” in which force is applied for deterrent purposes and does not indicate a deterrence failure, as we describe above.¹⁰⁸\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable.¹⁰⁹ And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future.¹¹⁰ Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”¹¹¹\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n¹⁰⁶ Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid., 385.\n¹⁰⁸ Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n¹⁰⁹ Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n¹¹⁰ Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n¹¹¹ Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n559\naim to cut off the attack vector at its source. This could include working with third party entities, typically telecommunications or cloud service providers, to enjoin them to cut off the attack from its point of the origin. Further, a state could emplace a \"logic bomb\" on its own networks, or partner networks with their consent, which is malicious code that an attacker takes back to her own network which subsequently triggers a negative impact, such as wiping files. A state could also penetrate an attacker's networks during the course of, or following, an attack for the purposes of destroying information with which the attacker absconded, stealing adversary information, wiping networks, or other retaliatory measures.¹¹⁴\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment.¹¹⁵ Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign.¹¹⁶ For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.¹¹⁷ Each\n¹¹⁴ Erica D.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119]\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n$^{127}$ John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

The first, spanning the early-2000s to the mid-2010s, heavily borrows from the nuclear deterrence literature, and leverages nuclear weapons as an analogy to cyber weapons. This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain. Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications. The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same. Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\nRobert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.[5]\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries.[6] These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible.[7] On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n[6] Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance? Conceptions, Causes, and Assessment’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 72–109; and Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’, *Journal of Strategic Studies* 38/1–2 (2015), 4–37.\n[7] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, Libicki, Cyber Deterrence and Cyberwar; Joseph S. Nye, Jr., ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 44–71; and Fischerkeller and Harknett explicitly contend deterrence is not possible subthreshold in cyberspace because of what they identify as inherent attributes of the cyberspace environment.\n[8] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 382.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nConversely, the guardedly optimistic camp sought to refine and caveat the early cyber deterrence literature, salvaging deterrence in cyberspace where possible. For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\" Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.\nWe build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial. In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial. As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of\n 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.\n 'Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (February 2017). 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America' (September 2018).\n A similar critique has historically been leveled at deterrence theorists. See, for example, George H. Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima: The Airpower Background of Modern Strategy (Routledge Publishers, 1986).\n Robert J. Art, 'To What Ends Military Power?' International Security 4/4 (1980), 3–35.\n 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', U.S. Department of Defense, January 2018.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Denial versus punishment\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.” Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.” Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains. The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment. Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.” In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies. We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for this insight.\n Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 9; and Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2004), 26.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ However, it is difficult to ascertain whether a given deterrent threat was successful because deterrence has a negative objective. See the following for debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategy during the Cold War: Robert Jervis, *The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984); Lawrence Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy* (London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 1989); Long, *Deterrence*; and Francis J.

Mearsheimer, ‘Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe’, *International Security* 9/3 (1984), 21.\n The addition of deterrence by entanglement and norms did not come until much later and is beyond a pure definition of deterrence, according to Nye in ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’.\n John J.

LONERGAN\noperations are perceived to be inordinately costly for an attacking state. $^{29}$  In related formulations, denial is \"preventing battlefield success,\" $^{30}$  and denial strategies aim to \"deny the opponent hope of achieving the disputed territorial objectives. Thus, denial campaigns focus on the target state's military strategy.\" $^{31}$  However, denial succeeds not only when a state can thwart an adversary's military operations, but also when it can target the capabilities on which its military objectives rely as well as its overall military strategy. $^{32}$  While the primary difference between denial and punishment is the nature of the target, there are other important distinctions between these deterrence mechanisms, such as denial being more credible and also calculable because it rests on assessing the deterring state's capabilities more so than its intention. $^{33}$\nWhile the logic of denial has been applied in the nuclear context, it is central to conventional deterrence strategies.[34] Conventional deterrence is \"a function of the capability of denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces.\"[35] Specifically, conventional deterrence works when the attacking states perceives that the probability of achieving its objectives on the battlefield is low and that the costs are likely to be high.[36] In the conventional realm, the efficacy of deterrence is conditional on two variables: first, the costs the attacker would have to pay in material resources, military and civilian casualties, and other related costs associated with the\n29Glenn Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 14-15.\n30Daniel Byman and Matthew Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion: American Foreign Policy and the Limits of Military Might (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 50. Importantly, their discussion of denial is in the context of coercion rather than deterrence, but deterrence is a coercive strategy and has a shared logic.\n31Robert A. Pape, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 19. While this is also a discussion of coercion, the same logic holds for deterrence.\n32Byman and Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion, 79; and Pape, Bombing to Win, 29.\n33Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 15-16; and Samuel P. Huntington makes a similar point in 'Conventional Deterrence and Conventional Retaliation in Europe', International Security 8/3 (1983), 35.\n34For denial in a nuclear context, see, for example, Jack L. Snyder, The Soviet Strategic Culture: Implications for Limited Nuclear Operations (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1977); Colin S. Gray, 'Theater Nuclear Weapons: Doctrines and Postures', World Politics 28/2 (January 1976), 305; Mearsheimer, 'Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe,' and Bernard Brodie's discussion of tactical nuclear weapons in 'The Development of Nuclear Strategy', International Security 2/4 (Spring 1978), 76-78. For conventional deterrence by denial, see, for example, Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence; Colin S. Gray, 'War-Fighting for Deterrence', The Journal of Strategic Studies 7/1 (1984), 5-28. Notably, Huntington argues that conventional deterrence by retaliation is also a viable strategy, which is essentially conventional deterrence by punishment. See Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence,' 36.\n35Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 15. Conventional deterrence is almost always discussed in the context of large-scale ground warfare, but there is some literature on maritime conventional deterrence. See, for example, James J. Wirtz, 'Strategic Conventional Deterrence: Lessons from the Maritime Strategy', Security Studies 3/1 (1993), 117-151. For a discussion of contemporary conventional deterrence, see Karl P. Mueller, 'Conventional Deterrence Redux: Avoiding Great Power Conflict in the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  Century', Strategic Studies Quarterly 12/4 (Winter 2018), 76-93.\n36Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23-24. One challenge with conventional deterrence that Mearsheimer notes is that it is difficult to properly assess the costs of war ex ante. This lays the groundwork for rationalist explanations for war. See, for example, James D. Fearon, 'Rationalist Explanations for War', International Organization 49/3 (1995), 379-414.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.” Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.” While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense). This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n Ibid., 24.\n Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36. Huntington notes that many people neglect the distinction between the concepts of 'defense' and 'retaliation' on page 37 of his work.\n47Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78-79.\n48Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, 'Deterrence: The Elusive Dependent Variable', World Politics 42/3 (1990), 336-369; and Paul Huth and Bruce Russett, 'Deterrence Failure and Crisis Escalation', International Studies Quarterly 32/1 (1998), 29-45.\n49Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 11.\n50Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Deterrence concepts in cyberspace and U.S. cyber strategy\nWithin the United States, cyber academics and practitioners rely on a variety of deterrence frameworks, some of which rest on implicit assumptions about their causal logics and how they relate to traditional deterrence concepts. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance. Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace. Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58]\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n[55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59]\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62]\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

Drezner, The Sanctions Paradox (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nEven more problematic is applying punishment concepts to within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat to retaliate with strategic cyber operations in response to a cyber attack. While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some\n64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes \"offensive cyber operations\" to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M. Morgan, ‘Applicability of Traditional Deterrence Concepts and Theory to the Cyber Realm’, In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (2010), 55.\n\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of \"defend forward\" (the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing \"homeland defense\" to, among other things, \"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing \"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82\nU.S. Cyber Command's \"hunt forward\" and \"malware inoculation\" efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed \"hunt forward\" operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages. See 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.'\n81'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n82'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n83For a full discussion of this topic see Erica D.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).” Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy. In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\nBorghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\nAniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense. In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable. And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future. Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n Ibid., 385.\n Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment. Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign. For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119]\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.\n#\nE.

LONERGAN\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n$^{127}$ John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

LONERGAN Jacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are\"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\"effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59] Below a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to\"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to\"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62] Unlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less- 59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's\"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

LONERGAN cybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of\"defend forward\"(the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing\"homeland defense\"to, among other things,\"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing\"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82 U.S. Cyber Command's\"hunt forward\"and\"malware inoculation\"efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed\"hunt forward\"operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which\"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\"and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in 79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11."

      "# Core elements of a denial approach Broadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure."

However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.”⁴¹ Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.”⁴² While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.⁴³\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense).⁴⁴ This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n³⁷ Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n³⁸ Ibid., 24.\n³⁹ Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n⁴⁰ In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n⁴¹ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n⁴² Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n⁴³ Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n⁴⁴ Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.",
    "# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables": "Finally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance.⁵³ Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace.⁵⁴ Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n⁵¹ Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n⁵² Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n⁵³ We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n⁵⁴ For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States\"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\"including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage\"all instruments of national power,\"specifically including\"military (both kinetic and cyber),\"to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience\"thin line\"of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to\"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58] Empirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks.

    "# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN Jacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are\"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\"effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59] Below a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to\"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to\"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62] Unlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less- 59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

Pape, 'Why Economic Sanctions Still Do Not Work', International Security 22/1 (Summer 1998), 66–77; Daniel W. Drezner, The Sanctions Paradox (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Even more problematic is applying punishment concepts to within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat to retaliate with strategic cyber operations in response to a cyber attack. While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States\"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States\"authorized offensive cyber operations\"to\"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy\"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66 However, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some 64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes\"offensive cyber operations\"to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

    "# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN actors. The history of cyber conflict largely bears out this argument – most “malicious cyber activity has taken place far below the threshold of armed conflict between states, and has not risen to the level that would trigger such a conflict.”": "The types of offensive cyber operation that, at a conceptual level, could generate punishment-level costs would be a cyber attack targeting civilian critical infrastructure that is essential to the functioning of a society.[71] However, it stretches credulity that the offensive employment of cyber power could generate the costs necessary for an effective punishment strategy. Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.",
    "# Deterrence by denial Unlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's\"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor. Relatedly, in Max Smeets and Herbert S. Lin, 'Offensive cyber capabilities: To what ends?' 2018 10$^{th}$ International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCOn), Tallinn, Estonia.": "Eric Talbot Jensen, 'The Tallinn Manual 2.0: Highlights and Insights', Georgetown Journal of International Law 48/3 (2017), 736.\nNadiya Kostyuk, Scott Powell, and Matt Skach, 'Determinants of the Cyber Escalation Ladder', The Cyber Defense Review 3/1 (2018), 123-134.\nBorghard and Lonergan, 'The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace'; Erica D.

For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M. Morgan, ‘Applicability of Traditional Deterrence Concepts and Theory to the Cyber Realm’, In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (2010), 55.",
    "# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN cybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of\"defend forward\"(the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing\"homeland defense\"to, among other things,\"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing\"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82 U.S. Cyber Command's\"hunt forward\"and\"malware inoculation\"efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed\"hunt forward\"operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which\"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\"and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in 79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.": "It would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).”⁹² Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy.⁹³ In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\n⁹²Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\n⁹³Aniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense.¹⁰³ In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.",
    "# Core elements of a denial approach Broadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.": "",
    "# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes The basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure ¹⁰³ Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).": "processes and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES In fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable.¹⁰⁹ And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future.¹¹⁰ Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”¹¹¹ Therefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary ¹⁰⁶ Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid., 385.\n¹⁰⁸ Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n¹⁰⁹ Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n¹¹⁰ Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n¹¹¹ Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.",
    "# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN offensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.": "Similarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).",
    "# Operationalizing a denial approach Operationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber\"weapons\"are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that 112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).": "113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Beyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment.¹¹⁵ Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign.¹¹⁶ For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as\"FancyBear,\"which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as\"Cozy Bear\"and\"The Dukes,\"which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.¹¹⁷ Each ¹¹⁴ Erica D.

LONERGAN of these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no\"one-size-fits-all\"approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.": "The second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119] # Application to defend forward and policy implications Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD\"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels 118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Nakasone described these efforts as targeting the adversary's offensive capabilities to increase the costs of their military actions through\"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\"and physically deploying defensive forces forward to\"conduct operations in support of our mission to help secure the mid-term elections.\"However, while this language broadly reflects a denial approach, senior policymakers or practitioners have not consistently articulated defend forward as such. Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of\"active disruption\"and\"persistent denial,\"neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks.

    "# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN Security Strategy. Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such.": "A related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that,\"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\"and noted that,\"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the\"cyber equivalent\"of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will\"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

The first, spanning the early-2000s to the mid-2010s, heavily borrows from the nuclear deterrence literature, and leverages nuclear weapons as an analogy to cyber weapons. This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain. Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications. The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same. Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\nRobert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324. Jeffrey Knopf identifies a ‘fourth wave’ of deterrence theory that addressed asymmetric threats in a post-9/11 international system. See Jeffrey W. Knopf, ‘The Fourth Wave in Deterrence Research’, *Contemporary Security Policy* 31/1 (2010), 1–33. For a review of deterrence theory, see Austin G.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.[5]\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries.[6] These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible.[7] On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n[6] Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance? Conceptions, Causes, and Assessment’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 72–109; and Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’, *Journal of Strategic Studies* 38/1–2 (2015), 4–37.\n[7] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, Libicki, Cyber Deterrence and Cyberwar; Joseph S. Nye, Jr., ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 44–71; and Fischerkeller and Harknett explicitly contend deterrence is not possible subthreshold in cyberspace because of what they identify as inherent attributes of the cyberspace environment.\n[8] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 382.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nConversely, the guardedly optimistic camp sought to refine and caveat the early cyber deterrence literature, salvaging deterrence in cyberspace where possible. For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\" Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.\nWe build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial. In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial. As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of\n 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.\n 'Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (February 2017). 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America' (September 2018).\n A similar critique has historically been leveled at deterrence theorists. See, for example, George H. Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima: The Airpower Background of Modern Strategy (Routledge Publishers, 1986).\n Robert J. Art, 'To What Ends Military Power?' International Security 4/4 (1980), 3–35.\n 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', U.S. Department of Defense, January 2018.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Denial versus punishment\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.” Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.” Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains. The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment. Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.” In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies. We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for this insight.\n Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 9; and Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2004), 26.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ However, it is difficult to ascertain whether a given deterrent threat was successful because deterrence has a negative objective. See the following for debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategy during the Cold War: Robert Jervis, *The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984); Lawrence Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy* (London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 1989); Long, *Deterrence*; and Francis J.

Mearsheimer, ‘Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe’, *International Security* 9/3 (1984), 21.\n The addition of deterrence by entanglement and norms did not come until much later and is beyond a pure definition of deterrence, according to Nye in ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’.\n John J.

LONERGAN\noperations are perceived to be inordinately costly for an attacking state. $^{29}$  In related formulations, denial is \"preventing battlefield success,\" $^{30}$  and denial strategies aim to \"deny the opponent hope of achieving the disputed territorial objectives. Thus, denial campaigns focus on the target state's military strategy.\" $^{31}$  However, denial succeeds not only when a state can thwart an adversary's military operations, but also when it can target the capabilities on which its military objectives rely as well as its overall military strategy. $^{32}$  While the primary difference between denial and punishment is the nature of the target, there are other important distinctions between these deterrence mechanisms, such as denial being more credible and also calculable because it rests on assessing the deterring state's capabilities more so than its intention. $^{33}$\nWhile the logic of denial has been applied in the nuclear context, it is central to conventional deterrence strategies.[34] Conventional deterrence is \"a function of the capability of denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces.\"[35] Specifically, conventional deterrence works when the attacking states perceives that the probability of achieving its objectives on the battlefield is low and that the costs are likely to be high.[36] In the conventional realm, the efficacy of deterrence is conditional on two variables: first, the costs the attacker would have to pay in material resources, military and civilian casualties, and other related costs associated with the\n29Glenn Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 14-15.\n30Daniel Byman and Matthew Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion: American Foreign Policy and the Limits of Military Might (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 50. Importantly, their discussion of denial is in the context of coercion rather than deterrence, but deterrence is a coercive strategy and has a shared logic.\n31Robert A. Pape, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 19. While this is also a discussion of coercion, the same logic holds for deterrence.\n32Byman and Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion, 79; and Pape, Bombing to Win, 29.\n33Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 15-16; and Samuel P. Huntington makes a similar point in 'Conventional Deterrence and Conventional Retaliation in Europe', International Security 8/3 (1983), 35.\n34For denial in a nuclear context, see, for example, Jack L. Snyder, The Soviet Strategic Culture: Implications for Limited Nuclear Operations (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1977); Colin S. Gray, 'Theater Nuclear Weapons: Doctrines and Postures', World Politics 28/2 (January 1976), 305; Mearsheimer, 'Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe,' and Bernard Brodie's discussion of tactical nuclear weapons in 'The Development of Nuclear Strategy', International Security 2/4 (Spring 1978), 76-78. For conventional deterrence by denial, see, for example, Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence; Colin S. Gray, 'War-Fighting for Deterrence', The Journal of Strategic Studies 7/1 (1984), 5-28. Notably, Huntington argues that conventional deterrence by retaliation is also a viable strategy, which is essentially conventional deterrence by punishment. See Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence,' 36.\n35Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 15. Conventional deterrence is almost always discussed in the context of large-scale ground warfare, but there is some literature on maritime conventional deterrence. See, for example, James J. Wirtz, 'Strategic Conventional Deterrence: Lessons from the Maritime Strategy', Security Studies 3/1 (1993), 117-151. For a discussion of contemporary conventional deterrence, see Karl P. Mueller, 'Conventional Deterrence Redux: Avoiding Great Power Conflict in the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  Century', Strategic Studies Quarterly 12/4 (Winter 2018), 76-93.\n36Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23-24. One challenge with conventional deterrence that Mearsheimer notes is that it is difficult to properly assess the costs of war ex ante. This lays the groundwork for rationalist explanations for war. See, for example, James D. Fearon, 'Rationalist Explanations for War', International Organization 49/3 (1995), 379-414.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.” Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.” While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense). This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n Ibid., 24.\n Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36. Huntington notes that many people neglect the distinction between the concepts of 'defense' and 'retaliation' on page 37 of his work.\n47Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78-79.\n48Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, 'Deterrence: The Elusive Dependent Variable', World Politics 42/3 (1990), 336-369; and Paul Huth and Bruce Russett, 'Deterrence Failure and Crisis Escalation', International Studies Quarterly 32/1 (1998), 29-45.\n49Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 11.\n50Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Deterrence concepts in cyberspace and U.S. cyber strategy\nWithin the United States, cyber academics and practitioners rely on a variety of deterrence frameworks, some of which rest on implicit assumptions about their causal logics and how they relate to traditional deterrence concepts. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance. Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace. Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58]\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n[55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59]\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62]\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

Pape, 'Why Economic Sanctions Still Do Not Work', International Security 22/1 (Summer 1998), 66–77; Daniel W. Drezner, The Sanctions Paradox (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nEven more problematic is applying punishment concepts to within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat to retaliate with strategic cyber operations in response to a cyber attack. While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some\n64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes \"offensive cyber operations\" to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W.

Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of \"defend forward\" (the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing \"homeland defense\" to, among other things, \"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing \"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82\nU.S. Cyber Command's \"hunt forward\" and \"malware inoculation\" efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed \"hunt forward\" operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages. See 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.'\n81'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n82'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n83For a full discussion of this topic see Erica D.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).” Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy. In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\nBorghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\nAniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense. In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable. And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future. Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n Ibid., 385.\n Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment. Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign. For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119]\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Nakasone', Joint Force Quarterly 92 (1st Quarter, 2019), 4-9; Paul M. Nakasone, 'A Cyber Force for Persistent Operations,' Joint Force Quarterly 92 (1st Quarter, 2019), 10-14.\n121Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', 2018, 1.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nwith a logic of denial, even if the concept is not explicitly referred to in his testimony. $^{122}$  Nakasone described these efforts as targeting the adversary's offensive capabilities to increase the costs of their military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" and physically deploying defensive forces forward to \"conduct operations in support of our mission to help secure the mid-term elections.\" $^{123}$\nHowever, while this language broadly reflects a denial approach, senior policymakers or practitioners have not consistently articulated defend forward as such. Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n$^{127}$ John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

The first, spanning the early-2000s to the mid-2010s, heavily borrows from the nuclear deterrence literature, and leverages nuclear weapons as an analogy to cyber weapons. This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain. Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications. The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same. Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\nRobert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.[5]\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries.[6] These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible.[7] On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n[6] Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance? Conceptions, Causes, and Assessment’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 72–109; and Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’, *Journal of Strategic Studies* 38/1–2 (2015), 4–37.\n[7] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, Libicki, Cyber Deterrence and Cyberwar; Joseph S. Nye, Jr., ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 44–71; and Fischerkeller and Harknett explicitly contend deterrence is not possible subthreshold in cyberspace because of what they identify as inherent attributes of the cyberspace environment.\n[8] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 382.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nConversely, the guardedly optimistic camp sought to refine and caveat the early cyber deterrence literature, salvaging deterrence in cyberspace where possible. For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\" Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.\nWe build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial. In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial. As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of\n 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.\n 'Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (February 2017). 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America' (September 2018).\n A similar critique has historically been leveled at deterrence theorists. See, for example, George H. Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima: The Airpower Background of Modern Strategy (Routledge Publishers, 1986).\n Robert J. Art, 'To What Ends Military Power?' International Security 4/4 (1980), 3–35.\n 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', U.S. Department of Defense, January 2018.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Denial versus punishment\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.” Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.” Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains. The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment. Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.” In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies. We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for this insight.\n Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 9; and Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2004), 26.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ However, it is difficult to ascertain whether a given deterrent threat was successful because deterrence has a negative objective. See the following for debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategy during the Cold War: Robert Jervis, *The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984); Lawrence Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy* (London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 1989); Long, *Deterrence*; and Francis J.

However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.” Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.” While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense). This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n Ibid., 24.\n Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance. Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace. Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58]\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n[55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59]\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62]\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

Pape, 'Why Economic Sanctions Still Do Not Work', International Security 22/1 (Summer 1998), 66–77; Daniel W. Drezner, The Sanctions Paradox (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nEven more problematic is applying punishment concepts to within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat to retaliate with strategic cyber operations in response to a cyber attack. While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some\n64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes \"offensive cyber operations\" to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nactors. $^{69}$  The history of cyber conflict largely bears out this argument – most “malicious cyber activity has taken place far below the threshold of armed conflict between states, and has not risen to the level that would trigger such a conflict.” $^{70}$\nThe types of offensive cyber operation that, at a conceptual level, could generate punishment-level costs would be a cyber attack targeting civilian critical infrastructure that is essential to the functioning of a society.[71] However, it stretches credulity that the offensive employment of cyber power could generate the costs necessary for an effective punishment strategy. Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M. Morgan, ‘Applicability of Traditional Deterrence Concepts and Theory to the Cyber Realm’, In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (2010), 55.\n\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\ncybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of \"defend forward\" (the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing \"homeland defense\" to, among other things, \"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing \"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82\nU.S. Cyber Command's \"hunt forward\" and \"malware inoculation\" efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed \"hunt forward\" operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages. See 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.'\n81'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n82'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n83For a full discussion of this topic see Erica D.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).” Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy. In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\nBorghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\nAniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense. In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable. And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future. Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n Ibid., 385.\n Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment. Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign. For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119]\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n$^{127}$ John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important.

Therefore, in this article, we review different deterrence concepts in theory and practice, articulate a logic of cyber deterrence by denial, and provide policy recommendations for the United States.\n## Evolution of the cyber deterrence literature\nContemporary cyber deterrence scholarship, similar to the traditional deterrence literature, has evolved in waves.¹ The first, spanning the early-2000s to the mid-2010s, heavily borrows from the nuclear deterrence literature, and leverages nuclear weapons as an analogy to cyber weapons. This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain.² Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications.³ The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same.⁴ Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\n¹Robert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324. Jeffrey Knopf identifies a ‘fourth wave’ of deterrence theory that addressed asymmetric threats in a post-9/11 international system. See Jeffrey W.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries. These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible. On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance?

For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n9 Ibid., 388.\n10 Schneider, ‘Deterrence in and through Cyberspace’; and Jon Lindsay, et al., ‘Cybersecurity and Cross-Domain Deterrence: The Consequences of Complexity’, Journal of Cybersecurity 1/1 (2015), 53–67.\n11 Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, 58–60; and Henry Farrell and Abraham L.

Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial.¹⁸ In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial.¹⁹ As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.²⁰\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of\n¹⁶ 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.\n¹⁷ 'Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Department of Defense, Defense Science Board (February 2017). 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America' (September 2018).\n¹⁸ A similar critique has historically been leveled at deterrence theorists. See, for example, George H. Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima: The Airpower Background of Modern Strategy (Routledge Publishers, 1986).\n¹⁹ Robert J. Art, 'To What Ends Military Power?' International Security 4/4 (1980), 3–35.\n²⁰ 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy', U.S. Department of Defense, January 2018.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n539\npunishment is a poor fit for cyberspace.²¹ Second, deterrence by denial, which is at the core of conventional deterrence, contains two distinct components, defense and denial, which the cyber deterrence literature often conflates. We show why these should be differentiated. Finally, conventional deterrence is also distinguished from nuclear deterrence in conceptualizing deterrence outcomes in continuous rather than binary terms.²² This has natural extensions to cyberspace, where outcomes are also more continuous.\n## Denial versus punishment\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.”²³ Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.”²⁴ Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains.²⁵ The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment.²⁶ Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.”²⁷ In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.²⁸\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n²¹ There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n²² However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies. We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for this insight.\n²³ Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 9; and Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2004), 26.\n²⁴ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ However, it is difficult to ascertain whether a given deterrent threat was successful because deterrence has a negative objective. See the following for debates about the efficacy of deterrence strategy during the Cold War: Robert Jervis, *The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984); Lawrence Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy* (London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 1989); Long, *Deterrence*; and Francis J. Gavin, *Nuclear Statecraft: History and Strategy in America’s Atomic Age* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012).\n²⁵ John J. Mearsheimer, ‘Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe’, *International Security* 9/3 (1984), 21.\n²⁶ The addition of deterrence by entanglement and norms did not come until much later and is beyond a pure definition of deterrence, according to Nye in ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’.\n²⁷ John J. Mearsheimer, *Conventional Deterrence* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 14–15.\n²⁸ Freedman, *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy*, 83.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\noperations are perceived to be inordinately costly for an attacking state. $^{29}$  In related formulations, denial is \"preventing battlefield success,\" $^{30}$  and denial strategies aim to \"deny the opponent hope of achieving the disputed territorial objectives. Thus, denial campaigns focus on the target state's military strategy.\" $^{31}$  However, denial succeeds not only when a state can thwart an adversary's military operations, but also when it can target the capabilities on which its military objectives rely as well as its overall military strategy. $^{32}$  While the primary difference between denial and punishment is the nature of the target, there are other important distinctions between these deterrence mechanisms, such as denial being more credible and also calculable because it rests on assessing the deterring state's capabilities more so than its intention. $^{33}$\nWhile the logic of denial has been applied in the nuclear context, it is central to conventional deterrence strategies. Conventional deterrence is \"a function of the capability of denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces.\" Specifically, conventional deterrence works when the attacking states perceives that the probability of achieving its objectives on the battlefield is low and that the costs are likely to be high. In the conventional realm, the efficacy of deterrence is conditional on two variables: first, the costs the attacker would have to pay in material resources, military and civilian casualties, and other related costs associated with the\n29Glenn Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 14-15.\n30Daniel Byman and Matthew Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion: American Foreign Policy and the Limits of Military Might (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 50. Importantly, their discussion of denial is in the context of coercion rather than deterrence, but deterrence is a coercive strategy and has a shared logic.\n31Robert A. Pape, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 19. While this is also a discussion of coercion, the same logic holds for deterrence.\n32Byman and Waxman, The Dynamics of Coercion, 79; and Pape, Bombing to Win, 29.\n33Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 15-16; and Samuel P. Huntington makes a similar point in 'Conventional Deterrence and Conventional Retaliation in Europe', International Security 8/3 (1983), 35.\n34For denial in a nuclear context, see, for example, Jack L. Snyder, The Soviet Strategic Culture: Implications for Limited Nuclear Operations (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1977); Colin S. Gray, 'Theater Nuclear Weapons: Doctrines and Postures', World Politics 28/2 (January 1976), 305; Mearsheimer, 'Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence in Europe,' and Bernard Brodie's discussion of tactical nuclear weapons in 'The Development of Nuclear Strategy', International Security 2/4 (Spring 1978), 76-78. For conventional deterrence by denial, see, for example, Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence; Colin S. Gray, 'War-Fighting for Deterrence', The Journal of Strategic Studies 7/1 (1984), 5-28. Notably, Huntington argues that conventional deterrence by retaliation is also a viable strategy, which is essentially conventional deterrence by punishment. See Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence,' 36.\n35Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 15. Conventional deterrence is almost always discussed in the context of large-scale ground warfare, but there is some literature on maritime conventional deterrence. See, for example, James J. Wirtz, 'Strategic Conventional Deterrence: Lessons from the Maritime Strategy', Security Studies 3/1 (1993), 117-151. For a discussion of contemporary conventional deterrence, see Karl P. Mueller, 'Conventional Deterrence Redux: Avoiding Great Power Conflict in the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  Century', Strategic Studies Quarterly 12/4 (Winter 2018), 76-93.\n36Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23-24. One challenge with conventional deterrence that Mearsheimer notes is that it is difficult to properly assess the costs of war ex ante. This lays the groundwork for rationalist explanations for war. See, for example, James D. Fearon, 'Rationalist Explanations for War', International Organization 49/3 (1995), 379-414.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n541\nmobilization, deployment, fighting, and maintenance of the force; and second, the probability of success, which is a function of time.³⁷ If an attacker believes he/she has a high probability of achieving victory in a short time span, then he/she is less likely to be deterred. However, if he/she calculates that victory will only be achieved after a protracted conflict, then he/she is more likely to be deterred because of the perceived costs that would accumulate over time.³⁸ Conventional military forces can deter in three ways: simply by their presence, they can increase the opponent's uncertainty about the true costs of war; by enabling defense, the attacker may calculate that he/she cannot achieve his/her military objectives at a reasonable cost; and by the threat of retaliation.³⁹ While the balance of forces plays an important role in conventional deterrence calculations, success is also a function of military strategy.⁴⁰\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.”⁴¹ Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.”⁴² While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.⁴³\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense).⁴⁴ This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n³⁷ Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n³⁸ Ibid., 24.\n³⁹ Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n⁴⁰ In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n⁴¹ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n⁴² Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n⁴³ Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n⁴⁴ Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected. However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars. In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\" Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36. Huntington notes that many people neglect the distinction between the concepts of 'defense' and 'retaliation' on page 37 of his work.\n47Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78-79.\n48Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, 'Deterrence: The Elusive Dependent Variable', World Politics 42/3 (1990), 336-369; and Paul Huth and Bruce Russett, 'Deterrence Failure and Crisis Escalation', International Studies Quarterly 32/1 (1998), 29-45.\n49Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 11.\n50Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n543\ndeterrence but, rather, part of making it succeed.⁵¹ Therefore, for conventional deterrence, the objective could be defined as, “reduc[ing] the probability of enemy military attacks,” and denial works by affecting the adversary’s “probability of gaining his objective.”⁵² This is not a binary outcome variable in which there are two possible results – success or failure – but rather, a continuous one in which success or failure is a matter of degree.\n## Deterrence concepts in cyberspace and U.S. cyber strategy\nWithin the United States, cyber academics and practitioners rely on a variety of deterrence frameworks, some of which rest on implicit assumptions about their causal logics and how they relate to traditional deterrence concepts. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance.⁵³ Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace.⁵⁴ Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n⁵¹ Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n⁵² Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n⁵³ We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n⁵⁴ For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks. The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks. Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\" And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\" Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\" Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior. In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some\n64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes \"offensive cyber operations\" to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

LONERGAN\nactors. $^{69}$  The history of cyber conflict largely bears out this argument – most “malicious cyber activity has taken place far below the threshold of armed conflict between states, and has not risen to the level that would trigger such a conflict.” $^{70}$\nThe types of offensive cyber operation that, at a conceptual level, could generate punishment-level costs would be a cyber attack targeting civilian critical infrastructure that is essential to the functioning of a society. However, it stretches credulity that the offensive employment of cyber power could generate the costs necessary for an effective punishment strategy. Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time. Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service. Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

Finally, from a U.S. policymaking perspective, the implementation of deterrence by denial has encompassed a range of instruments of national power, ranging from diplomacy to law enforcement. This significantly expands the scope of deterrence by denial mechanisms, which we argue is problematic. Below, we review “defense” approaches to deterrence by denial and discuss their limitations, and then articulate a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace based on “denial.”\n## Defensive approaches to deterrence by denial\nIn depicting deterrence by denial, the cyber academic literature almost universally defines denial as a function of defense.74 For example, Dorothy Denning argues that deterrence by denial offers the most likely prospects for success in cyberspace, focusing on “cyber security mechanisms and practices, including the regular installation of security patches, the use of strong methods for authentication, and the application of firewalls, black and white lists, intrusion prevention systems, antivirus tools, encryption, and so forth.”75 Similarly, Jacquelyn Schneider discusses different means of deterrence by denial in cyberspace, including improving basic cyber hygiene, hardening defenses, and augmenting threat information sharing.76 While Schneider acknowledges that deterrence by denial is technically feasible in some contexts (and certainly more so than deterrence by punishment), she posits that the strategy “by itself might not be able to credibly or effectively deter both low-scale malicious cyberspace activity and more significant cyber attacks.”77 Joseph Nye’s discussion of deterrence by denial focuses on improving resilience in addition to shoring up defenses, the logic being that if a state is more resilient and can withstand and rapidly recover from a cyber attack, it will buttress deterrence by making the attack less appealing in the first place.78\nThis is also paralleled in U.S. policymaking circles. For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M.

LONERGAN\ncybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of \"defend forward\" (the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing \"homeland defense\" to, among other things, \"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing \"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82\nU.S. Cyber Command's \"hunt forward\" and \"malware inoculation\" efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense. As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed \"hunt forward\" operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience. Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal. In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack. In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages. See 'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018.'\n81'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n82'Summary: Department of Defense Cyber Strategy 2018', p. 2.\n83For a full discussion of this topic see Erica D.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n552 E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).”⁹² Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy.⁹³ In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\n⁹²Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\n⁹³Aniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

The U.S. DoJ explicitly describes its organization as \"play[ing] an essential role in detecting, deterring, and disrupting cyber threats,\" and does so through \"enforcing federal laws through the array of legal tools and capabilities.\"\nA significant portion of U.S. cyber strategy has rested on law enforcement actions, such as DoJ indictments of individuals and entities attributed to malicious cyber campaigns targeting U.S. interests. Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer note that the United States has accelerated its use of indictments for malicious cyber activity, identifying since 2014, \"24 cases and 195 counts against 93 foreign nationals that either explicitly allege or where we have reason to believe foreign state responsibility for malicious cyber activity or foreign influence operations.\" Beyond indictments, law enforcement actions that could be used for denial purposes also include botnet takedowns, such as the FBI's \"Operation Clean Slate\" in 2013, or disrupting Dark Web marketplaces, such as the Netherlands's National High Tech Crime's dismantling of Hansa in 2016. More recently, in January 2021, the U.S. DoJ announced a multinational operation to take down the botnet, Emotet, among the costliest malware in the world. While malicious actors often can reconstitute these capabilities in the wake of such actions, in theory,\n94\"Taking Down Botnets: Public and Private Efforts to Disrupt and Dismantle Criminal Networks.'

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n555\n# A strategy of denial for cyberspace\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense.¹⁰³ In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n¹⁰³ Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n557\nin how the nuclear, rather than conventional, deterrence literature defines the dependent variable. The observance of cyber operations in itself should not be held up as an indication that deterrence has failed.¹⁰⁶ For example, Fischerkeller and Harknett describe deterrence as “a strategy based upon a threat of use of force with an operational objective of avoiding costly operational contact (i.e., the actual use of force).”¹⁰⁷ This is indeed the case for nuclear deterrence. However, as Schelling notes, in the conventional realm deterrence may take the form of “graduated deterrence” in which force is applied for deterrent purposes and does not indicate a deterrence failure, as we describe above.¹⁰⁸\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable.¹⁰⁹ And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future.¹¹⁰ Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”¹¹¹\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n¹⁰⁶ Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid., 385.\n¹⁰⁸ Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n¹⁰⁹ Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n¹¹⁰ Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n¹¹¹ Martin C.

Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n#\nE.

LONERGAN\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance. Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n559\naim to cut off the attack vector at its source. This could include working with third party entities, typically telecommunications or cloud service providers, to enjoin them to cut off the attack from its point of the origin. Further, a state could emplace a \"logic bomb\" on its own networks, or partner networks with their consent, which is malicious code that an attacker takes back to her own network which subsequently triggers a negative impact, such as wiping files. A state could also penetrate an attacker's networks during the course of, or following, an attack for the purposes of destroying information with which the attacker absconded, stealing adversary information, wiping networks, or other retaliatory measures.¹¹⁴\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment.¹¹⁵ Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign.¹¹⁶ For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.¹¹⁷ Each\n¹¹⁴ Erica D.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent. Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects. For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community, an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense. Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative. Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies. For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\" More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\" While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n$^{127}$ John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain.² Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications.³ The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same.⁴ Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\n¹Robert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 , 289–324.

LONERGAN\nthreat to wreak devastating pain and suffering on a target's civilian population such that the perceived costs of an action are perceived to be unacceptably high – is the prominent reference point.[5]\nThis early cyber deterrence literature identifies a number of purportedly unique or distinct characteristics of the cyber domain that are hypothesized to have implications for the successful functioning of deterrence, such as problems of attribution, low barriers to entry, the proliferation of state and non-state actors, the advantage of offense over defense, the speed with which cyber attacks take place, or the absence of borders and boundaries.[6] These scholars' basic conclusion is that cyber deterrence is highly problematic, if not impossible.[7] On its face, the empirical record appears to support this skepticism. Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W. Singer, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know* (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n[6] Some of the unique characteristics of the cyber domain are due to the global, interdependent, and effectively borderless nature of cyberspace, where adversary activities occur across traditional sovereign boundaries. Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P. Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace’, *Orbis* 61/3 (2017), 381–393; Rebecca Slayton, ‘What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance? Conceptions, Causes, and Assessment’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 72–109; and Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’, *Journal of Strategic Studies* 38/1–2 (2015), 4–37.\n[7] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, Libicki, Cyber Deterrence and Cyberwar; Joseph S. Nye, Jr., ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, *International Security* 41/3 (2017), 44–71; and Fischerkeller and Harknett explicitly contend deterrence is not possible subthreshold in cyberspace because of what they identify as inherent attributes of the cyberspace environment.\n[8] Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 382.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nConversely, the guardedly optimistic camp sought to refine and caveat the early cyber deterrence literature, salvaging deterrence in cyberspace where possible. For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13 Many U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n\n# E.

LONERGAN cyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\"¹⁶ Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.¹⁷ We build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial.¹⁸ In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between\"defense\"as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial.¹⁹ As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of\"defend forward\"– and our denial concept.²⁰ ## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence In making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace.

This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n²¹ There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace. See Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, However, to scope our analysis, we exclude these.\n²² However, it is important to note that recent research has demonstrated that Cold War nuclear strategies were not solely organized around punishment via countervalue strikes, and also included damage limitation and counterforce strategies.

Importantly, their discussion of denial is in the context of coercion rather than deterrence, but deterrence is a coercive strategy and has a shared logic.\n31Robert A. Pape, Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 19.

Huntington makes a similar point in 'Conventional Deterrence and Conventional Retaliation in Europe', International Security 8/3 (1983), 35.\n34For denial in a nuclear context, see, for example, Jack L.

For conventional deterrence by denial, see, for example, Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence; Colin S. Gray, 'War-Fighting for Deterrence', The Journal of Strategic Studies 7/1 (1984), 5-28. Notably, Huntington argues that conventional deterrence by retaliation is also a viable strategy, which is essentially conventional deterrence by punishment. See Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence,' 36.\n35Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 15. Conventional deterrence is almost always discussed in the context of large-scale ground warfare, but there is some literature on maritime conventional deterrence. See, for example, James J. Wirtz, 'Strategic Conventional Deterrence: Lessons from the Maritime Strategy', Security Studies 3/1 (1993), 117-151. For a discussion of contemporary conventional deterrence, see Karl P. Mueller, 'Conventional Deterrence Redux: Avoiding Great Power Conflict in the  $21^{\\text{st}}$  Century', Strategic Studies Quarterly 12/4 , 76-93.\n36Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23-24. One challenge with conventional deterrence that Mearsheimer notes is that it is difficult to properly assess the costs of war ex ante. This lays the groundwork for rationalist explanations for war. See, for example, James D. Fearon, 'Rationalist Explanations for War', International Organization 49/3 (1995), 379-414.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.”⁴¹ Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.”⁴² While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.⁴³\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense).⁴⁴ This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n³⁷ Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n³⁸ Ibid., 24.\n³⁹ Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n⁴⁰ In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 29–30.\n⁴¹ Art, ‘To What Ends Military Power?’ 5. Although, interestingly, Art’s definition of deterrence is entirely focused on deterrence by punishment and does not conceive of deterrence by denial.\n⁴² Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966), 78.\n⁴³ Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, p. 30 fn. 21, and p. 31.\n⁴⁴ Ibid, 3–5.\n#\nE. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\nproduce a high level of deterrence may not yield a high degree of security.\"45 Samuel Huntington also observes that conventional defense can contribute to conventional deterrence, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.46 For Schelling, the distinction between denial and defense is centered on force structure and the intent of force employment. If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars. This use of force does not represent a failure of\n45Ibid, 31.\n46Huntington, 'Conventional Deterrence', 36.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of cyber strategies and contributes to conceptual confusion. Clarifying these can help to distill differences in the cyber literature about deterrence mechanisms as well as provide clearer policy guidance.⁵³ Table 1 depicts how different cyber deterrence concepts are related to traditional forms of deterrence (denial and punishment) as well as the deterrence mechanisms associated with them (denial, defense, and punishment). The table also articulates the implicit causal logic of each cyber deterrence concept and provides some illustrative examples of how applications of U.S. cyber strategy and policy map onto the different concepts.\nWe argue that, unlike deterrence by punishment – which is hampered by fundamental problems that make the likelihood of success negligible, if not impossible – deterrence by denial is attainable in cyberspace.⁵⁴ Below, we first discuss the infeasibility of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace. Next, we unpack deterrence by denial into its constituent components, defense and denial. We show why, both conceptually and in practice, a deterrence by denial approach based on defense also has significant limitations. Finally, we discuss core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy based on more offensive approach to denial and assess how these relates to the DoD’s defend forward concept. Therefore, our analysis aims to impose rigor on existing deterrence concepts, more narrowly scope which forms of deterrence by denial are feasible, and articulate a path forward for scholars and practitioners.\n⁵¹ Jonathan Shimshoni, *Israel and Conventional Deterrence: Border Warfare from 1953 to 1970* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988).\n⁵² Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense*, 12–13.\n⁵³ We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for pointing out both the conceptual and policymaking consequences of the ambiguities in existing cyber deterrence concepts.\n⁵⁴ For a discussion of why punishment strategies are unlikely to succeed, see Erica D.

The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States\"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\"including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage\"all instruments of national power,\"specifically including\"military (both kinetic and cyber),\"to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience\"thin line\"of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to\"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58] Empirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and [55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.\n# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN Jacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are\"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\"effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59] Below a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to\"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to\"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62] Unlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less- 59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

Pape, 'Why Economic Sanctions Still Do Not Work', International Security 22/1, 66–77; Daniel W. Drezner, The Sanctions Paradox (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Even more problematic is applying punishment concepts to within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat to retaliate with strategic cyber operations in response to a cyber attack. While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States\"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States\"authorized offensive cyber operations\"to\"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy\"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66 However, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover. In fact, it is precisely the impermanent and reversible nature of cyber operations that makes them appealing for some 64\"Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 15.\n65Ellen Nakashima, 'White House authorizes\"offensive cyber operations\"to deter foreign adversaries', The Washington Post, 20 September 2018.\n66David E.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN actors. The history of cyber conflict largely bears out this argument – most “malicious cyber activity has taken place far below the threshold of armed conflict between states, and has not risen to the level that would trigger such a conflict.” \nThe types of offensive cyber operation that, at a conceptual level, could generate punishment-level costs would be a cyber attack targeting civilian critical infrastructure that is essential to the functioning of a society.[71] However, it stretches credulity that the offensive employment of cyber power could generate the costs necessary for an effective punishment strategy. Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n# Deterrence by denial Unlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's\"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n74Patrick M.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN cybersecurity.\"79 Similarly, the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, which articulated the concept of\"defend forward\"(the offensive elements of which we will discuss in the subsequent section), also contains elements of the defensive form of deterrence by denial – even if deterrence is not as heavily emphasized as the 2015 strategy.80 Specifically, the DoD identifies defend forward as encompassing\"homeland defense\"to, among other things,\"deter malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.\"81 Part of this includes providing\"public and private sector partners with indications and warning (I&amp;W) of malicious cyber activity.\"82 U.S. Cyber Command's\"hunt forward\"and\"malware inoculation\"efforts are one example of how defend forward is linked to deterrence through improving defense.[83] As part of defend forward, U.S. Cyber Command conducts threat hunting to proactively searching for cyber threats on assets and networks, also termed\"hunt forward\"operations. For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which\"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\"and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in 79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright. For example, in the unclassified summary, deterrence is specifically enumerated as a strategic objective, and the term appears eleven times across only seven short pages.

This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.\n\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).”⁹² Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n## Law enforcement as denial\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy.⁹³ In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\n⁹²Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\n⁹³Aniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense.¹⁰³ In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n# Core elements of a denial approach Broadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes The basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure ¹⁰³ Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\nprocesses and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES In fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable.¹⁰⁹ And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future.¹¹⁰ Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”¹¹¹ Therefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary ¹⁰⁶ Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid., 385.\n¹⁰⁸ Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n¹⁰⁹ Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n¹¹⁰ Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n¹¹¹ Martin C. Libicki, Brandishing Cyber Capabilities (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2013), xi, 2–3. Also see Brendan Rittenhouse Green and Austin Long, ‘Conceal or Reveal? Managing Clandestine Military Capabilities in Peacetime Competition’, International Security 44/3 (2020), 82. Despite Libicki’s stark statement on the ‘single-use’ nature of cyber capabilities, while the overall meaning of his statement is accurate, in practice there is some time period between when a capability is used and when it becomes less effective due to modified defenses.\n# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN offensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n# Operationalizing a denial approach Operationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber\"weapons\"are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that 112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Beyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment.¹¹⁵ Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign.¹¹⁶ For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as\"FancyBear,\"which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as\"Cozy Bear\"and\"The Dukes,\"which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.¹¹⁷ Each ¹¹⁴ Erica D.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN of these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no\"one-size-fits-all\"approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119] # Application to defend forward and policy implications Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD\"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels 118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Nakasone described these efforts as targeting the adversary's offensive capabilities to increase the costs of their military actions through\"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\"and physically deploying defensive forces forward to\"conduct operations in support of our mission to help secure the mid-term elections.\"However, while this language broadly reflects a denial approach, senior policymakers or practitioners have not consistently articulated defend forward as such. Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of\"active disruption\"and\"persistent denial,\"neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach.

D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN Security Strategy. Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. \nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that,\"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\"and noted that,\"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the\"cyber equivalent\"of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will\"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n John S.

Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n## Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

LONERGAN cyberspace below the level of armed conflict.\"¹⁶ Other strategy documents, ranging from the 2017 Defense Science Board's Task Force on Cyber Deterrence to the Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy, are also explicitly anchored in deterrence and advocate for deterrence-based strategies, while at the same time implying or stating that U.S. deterrence has not been successful.¹⁷ We build on this latter body of cautious deterrence optimist scholarship to argue that deterrence by denial in cyberspace is possible and further articulate the logic and implementation of a denial strategy. Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial.¹⁸ In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between\"defense\"as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial.¹⁹ As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of\"defend forward\"– and our denial concept.²⁰ ## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence In making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence. The former literature contains three applications to cyberspace. First, at a fundamental level, the logic of ¹⁶ 'United States of America Cyberspace Solarium Commission', March 2020, pp. 14–15.|# E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN Jacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are\"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\"effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59] Below a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to\"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to\"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62] Unlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less- 59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

This literature applies concepts such as the security dilemma, the offense-defense balance, and counter-value versus counter-force targeting to the cyber-domain.² Akin to nuclear weapons, this literature characterizes the advent of cyber weapons as heralding a revolution in warfare with significant and systemic implications.³ The central research question for these scholars is whether deterrence is even possible in cyberspace. Sometimes explicitly, but usually implicitly, cyber deterrence refers to reciprocal, within-domain deterrence; that is, the threat of employing cyber capabilities to prevent an adversary from doing the same.⁴ Moreover, deterrence by punishment – the credible\n\n¹Robert Jervis, ‘Deterrence Theory Revisited’, *World Politics* 31/2 (January 1979), 289–324.

Academics and think tanks have collected data documenting the proliferation of hundreds of cyber operations over the past few decades, including significant offensive cyber operations that have targeted critical infrastructure and caused major economic effects (such as Russia's cyber attack against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016, the Stuxnet cyber attack targeting Iran's nuclear weapons program, Iran's distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial system from 2012-2013, or the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, attributed to Russia, that unleashed destructive malware around the world).\n\nThe second wave of cyber deterrence theory, which emerged in the mid-2010s, takes the feasibility of cyber deterrence in two distinct directions, one chartered by what we refer to as \"deep deterrence pessimists\" and the other by a diverse group of \"cautious deterrence optimists.\" The deterrence pessimists, epitomized by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller's work, effectively throw the deterrence baby out with the bathwater. Harknett and Fischerkeller argue that specific attributes of cyberspace, especially the absence of traditional sovereignty and an environment of \"constant contact,\" mean the \"protection or advancement of national interests cannot rest on deterrence as the central strategy.\" They argue that this has critical\n\n[5] Glenn Snyder, *Deterrence and Defense* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1961), 14–15; Allan Friedman and P.W.

Furthermore, some early cyber deterrence scholars believed these unique characteristics enabled the offense to possess the ‘upper-hand.’ For further analysis, see the following: Michael P.

For example, Jacquelyn Schneider, Erik Gartzke, and Jon Lindsay situate cyber capabilities within a broader context by focusing on the logic of cross-domain deterrence – the employment of tools across domains of warfare to deter cyber attacks as well as the use of cyber operations for non-cyber objectives10; Joseph Nye, Henry Farrell, and Abraham Newman explore how interdependence and entanglement of actors in cyberspace could have deterrent effects11; Gartzke and Lindsay further explore how the role of deception in cyberspace could aid rather than undermine deterrence12; and Schneider and Nye both explore the extent to which deterrence by denial, rather than punishment, may be technically feasible in cyberspace.13\n\nMany U.S. practitioners have echoed this cautious optimism, which is also reflected in U.S. strategy and policy. For instance, during his 2018 Senate confirmation hearing, then-Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone noted that he “believe[s] it is possible for actions in cyberspace to have a deterrent effect and contribute to the Nation’s overall deterrence posture,” but also noted that “[t]he current level and tempo of cyber attacks is not tolerable.”14 Similarly, the March 2020 report of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, established in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to develop a U.S. strategy for cyberspace, articulates a strategy of “layered cyber deterrence” that “combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends them beyond the government to develop a whole-of-nation approach.”15 At the same time, the report depicts an environment in which the United States has not deterred a range of malicious cyber behavior, noting that “the United States has not sufficiently changed the cost-benefit calculus made by adversaries when determining whether or not to attack in\n\n9 Ibid., 388.\n\n10 Schneider, ‘Deterrence in and through Cyberspace’; and Jon Lindsay, et al., ‘Cybersecurity and Cross-Domain Deterrence: The Consequences of Complexity’, Journal of Cybersecurity 1/1 (2015), 53–67.\n\n11 Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, 58–60; and Henry Farrell and Abraham L.

Specifically, we argue that the evolution of the cyber deterrence literature outlined above suffers from a problem of scholarly path dependence. Early emphasis in the literature on comparisons to the nuclear deterrence literature, particularly deterrence by punishment concepts, confers too much prominence to the latter ideas at the expense of the conventional deterrence literature, which is anchored in deterrence by denial.¹⁸ In revitalizing the conventional deterrence literature, we provide a framework for cyber deterrence by denial and articulate the mechanisms through which different strategic and operational concepts could serve denial objectives, with a particular focus on cyber strategy in the United States. We also explore the relationship between \"defense\" as a standalone concept versus as a subset of deterrence by denial, and show why conflating these concepts risks overlooking the offensive elements of denial.¹⁹ As part of our analysis, we map different deterrence concepts in U.S. cyber strategy and policy onto existing frameworks. We argue that a lack of clarity about cyber deterrence strategies inevitably produced conceptual confusion. Finally, we describe the core elements of a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace and identify the gap between existing U.S. approaches that are suggestive of deterrence by denial – particularly the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)'s 2018 concept of \"defend forward\" – and our denial concept.²⁰\n\n## Deterrence by denial and conventional deterrence\n\nIn making a case for deterrence by denial in cyberspace, we draw from the traditional deterrence by denial literature and, in particular, the literature on conventional rather than nuclear deterrence.

We show why these should be differentiated. Finally, conventional deterrence is also distinguished from nuclear deterrence in conceptualizing deterrence outcomes in continuous rather than binary terms.²² This has natural extensions to cyberspace, where outcomes are also more continuous.\n\n## Denial versus punishment\n\nDeterrence is a coercive strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking an unacceptable action; it is the “power to dissuade.”²³ Robert Art defines deterrence as “the deployment of military power so as to be able to prevent an adversary from doing something that one does not want him to do and that he otherwise might be tempted to do by threatening him with unacceptable punishment if he does it.”²⁴ Deterrence succeeds when the target perceives that the costs and risks of a military action outweigh the expected gains.²⁵ The literature distinguishes between two variants of deterrence: denial and punishment.²⁶ Punishment “involves threatening to destroy large portions of an opponent’s civilian population and industry,” while denial “requires convincing an opponent that he will not attain his goals on the battlefield.”²⁷ In the context of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment involves counter value targeting against the adversary’s population centers.²⁸\n\nIn contrast, deterrence by denial involves threatening to physically impede an adversary’s ability to successfully carry out a military operation or making it too costly to do so. This form of deterrence works by targeting an adversary’s military capabilities or shoring up one’s own defenses such that offensive\n\n²¹ There are other mechanisms of deterrence beyond punishment and denial, such as deterrence by entanglement or deterrence by normative taboos, which have also been extended to cyberspace.

However, if he/she calculates that victory will only be achieved after a protracted conflict, then he/she is more likely to be deterred because of the perceived costs that would accumulate over time.³⁸ Conventional military forces can deter in three ways: simply by their presence, they can increase the opponent's uncertainty about the true costs of war; by enabling defense, the attacker may calculate that he/she cannot achieve his/her military objectives at a reasonable cost; and by the threat of retaliation.³⁹ While the balance of forces plays an important role in conventional deterrence calculations, success is also a function of military strategy.⁴⁰\n\n## Defense and denial as distinct components of deterrence by denial\n\nDeterrence by denial is sometimes erroneously conflated with the concept of defense. However, these are distinct concepts. While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only – or even primary – means of achieving denial. Defense is a distinct strategic concept in its own right. Robert Art defines the defensive use of force as “the deployment of military power … to ward off an attack and to minimize damage to oneself if attacked.”⁴¹ Thomas Schelling terms this “forcible defense” or “pure defense,” in which the objective is to “resist successfully, so that the enemy cannot succeed even if he tries.”⁴² While possessing strong defensive capabilities may, in itself, deter aggression by affecting the opponents’ calculus regarding the expected costs of war, it is not synonymous with denial capabilities. Denial entails the “capability to hold territory in case of attack,” while defensive capabilities protect a state’s security if deterrence fails.⁴³\n\nMilitary capabilities that can threaten another state’s military capabilities used to achieve their strategic objectives (denial) may not overlap perfectly with capabilities that can mitigate the consequences of enemy aggression (defense).⁴⁴ This is why, Glenn Snyder notes, “capabilities and threats which\n\n³⁷ Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence, 23.\n³⁸ Ibid., 24.\n³⁹ Huntington, ‘Conventional Deterrence’, 35–36.\n⁴⁰ In particular, Mearsheimer identifies three strategies of conventional deterrence: attrition, blitzkrieg, and limited aims.

If the intent were to ensure an attacking enemy could not succeed, it would constitute defense. However, \"[i] f the object is to induce ... [the enemy] not to proceed, by making his encroachment painful or costly, we can ... call it ... 'deterrent' defense.\"47 Definitions of denial capabilities and Schelling's \"deterrent defense\" are both organized around imposing costs on the military capabilities an adversary employs to accomplish strategic objectives with the goal of convincing an opponent that an offensive military action would be too costly to pursue, whereas defense is about survival.\n\n# Continuous versus binary-dependent variables\n\nFinally, an important difference between conventional and nuclear deterrence is how the dependent variable is conceptualized. In general, deterrence failures are observable when the deterring state has to resort to force once the opponent has defected.[48] However, in the context of nuclear deterrence, this outcome is starkly binary. A single failure of deterrence that results in the employment of nuclear weapons (particularly strategic nuclear capabilities) would have devastating consequences. In contrast, the outcome variable is more ambiguous for conventional deterrence and denial strategies. For instance, Snyder argues that deterrence by denial can operate both prior to and during warfighting, particularly during limited wars.[49] In this context, the application of force could deter further aggression or incursion by an opponent. Schelling discusses the concept of \"graduated deterrence\" or \"active deterrence\" for conventional deterrence, in which force could be used for the purposes of \"demonstrating by resistance that the conquest will be costly.\"[50] Jonathan Shimshoni argues that the robustness of a state's deterrence is established over time and, therefore, a state may have to employ force in some circumstances to develop a strong deterrent reputation, including waging limited wars.

    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n545\n\n# Deterrence by punishment\n\nApplying the logic of deterrence by punishment to cyberspace suffers from challenges of feasibility and credibility. The crux of deterrence by punishment applied to cyberspace entails the threat to respond to a cyber attack by imposing substantial costs against an adversary through cyber means by conducting strategic cyber attacks (within-domain), or through kinetic non-cyber means, which may include conventional or nuclear military force (cross-domain). The premise is that the consequences of the threatened of retaliation are so severe that they would deter the undesired behavior.\n\nSome parts of U.S. cyber strategy are implicitly grounded in the logic of retaliation for cyber attacks that breach an ambiguously defined threshold of significance. The Obama administration's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace articulates a declaratory policy analogous to other domains – that the United States \"reserve[s] the right to use all necessary means,\" including military force, to respond to cyber attacks.[55] The Trump administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy similarly claims that the United States will leverage \"all instruments of national power,\" specifically including \"military (both kinetic and cyber),\" to respond to cyber attacks.[56] Most directly consistent with a deterrence by punishment logic, a 2017 Defense Science Board report calls for the United States to maintain a cyber-resilience \"thin line\" of critical retaliatory capabilities (including cyber, conventional, and nuclear) as a deterrent to \"the most sophisticated large-scale cyber attacks.\"[57] And the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, conducted during the Trump administration, implied that the United States could respond with nuclear weapons (most likely limited nuclear options) to cyber attacks that target NC3.[58]\n\nEmpirically assessing the efficacy of cross-domain deterrence by punishment strategies in cyberspace is challenging because, to date, there has not been a significant cyber attack that has crossed a threshold that has triggered conventional, let alone, nuclear retaliation. It is difficult to evaluate whether the absence of adversary strategic cyber attacks is attributable to effective deterrence by punishment or other, unrelated factors. That said, from a conceptual perspective, the threat of cross-domain punishment mechanisms suffers from significant credibility issues. Specifically, convincing an adversary that a state will respond to a cyber attack with conventional or nuclear capabilities – which would dramatically escalate a crisis – would likely be perceived as implausible, especially given the general absence of physical violence stemming from cyber attacks. Indeed, research by Sarah Kreps and\n\n[55] 'International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World', *The White House*, May 2011, p. 14.\n[56] 'National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America', *The White House*, September 2018, p. 21.\n[57] 'Department of Defense, Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Deterrence', Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, February 2017, p. 17.\n[58] 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, pp. 31, 57–58.",

LONERGAN\n\nJacquelyn Schneider has demonstrated that, in the context of cyber war-games, individuals are \"considerably more restrained when it comes to aggressive retaliatory actions involving the use of force,\" effectively creating a firebreak between cyber and conventional realms.[59]\n\nBelow a use of force threshold, the United States routinely employs economic measures as a means of imposing costs on adversaries to deter malicious cyber behavior short of war. There is, of course, an a priori question of whether a post-hoc response to an event could even serve deterrence purposes. While punishment after the fact cannot deter an event that has already taken place, it could contribute to deterrence outcomes over the long term by signaling a willingness to respond and clarifying the boundaries of appropriate behavior. Regardless, policymakers have consistency couched economic cost-imposition measures in cyber deterrence terms. A critical juncture for U.S. cyber sanctions policy took place in April 2015 when the Obama administration released an executive order that defined authority for the U.S. to impose sanctions in response to \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"[60] Senior administration officials explicitly described the use of sanctions as serving deterrence purposes. Lisa Monaco, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, noted that economic sanctions were a critical capability to \"deter malicious cyber activity and to impose costs ... on those responsible for significant harmful cyber activity where it really hurts – at their bottom line.\"[61] Since then, economic measures have been an important cyber deterrence tool for U.S. policymakers. According to the think tank Third Way, since 2015, the United States has imposed sanctions against over 300 entities and individuals, mostly affiliated with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, related to malicious cyber behavior.[62]\n\nUnlike the threat to use conventional or nuclear force in response to a cyber attack, the threat to impose economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber operations is manifestly credible given the frequency with which the tool is employed. However, this form of deterrence has its own challenges, most notably the poor track record of economic sanctions in general (not only in cyberspace) in altering adversary behavior.[63] In the cyber realm in particular, the U.S. has been hesitant to impose broader, less-\n\n59Sarah Kreps and Jacquelyn Schneider, 'Escalation Firebreaks in the Cyber, Conventional, and Nuclear Domains: Moving Beyond Effects-Based Logics', Journal of Cybersecurity 5/1 (2019), 5.

While less explicitly articulated in U.S. policy documents, which tend to couch deterrence declarations in strategic ambiguity about retaliatory options, there is some evidence that part of the U.S. posture includes retaliatory cyber attacks as part of a deterrence approach. For instance, the 2017 Defense Science Board report emphasizes that the United States \"must maintain – and be seen to maintain – an array of scalable offensive cyber capabilities – including high-impact strategic cyber attack options – as an integral part of its cyber deterrence posture.\"64 While more speculative, a number of major media outlets reported in 2018–2019 that the U.S. was considering offensive cyber operations as part of cyber deterrence strategy. For instance, The Washington Post reported in 2018 that then-National Security Advisor, John Bolton, indicated that the United States \"authorized offensive cyber operations\" to \"create structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to adversaries that the costs of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear.\"65 And The New York Times reported in 2019 that U.S. strategy \"has shifted more toward offense, officials say, with the placement of potentially crippling malware inside [Russia's electric grid] at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before. It is intended partly as a warning, and partly to be poised to conduct cyberstrikes if major conflict broke out between Washington and Moscow.\"66\n\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with applying punishment logics to cyberspace that have been extensively noted in the academic literature. These center on the limitations of offensive cyber operations in inflicting major damage, which is essential for implementing punishment strategies.67 Cyber operations and campaigns, even at scale, simply do not generate costs against a target at a magnitude comparable to that of offensive operations that employ conventional or, certainly, nuclear munitions.68 Most cyber operations are disruptive, causing temporary effects from which targets can rapidly recover.

Offensive cyber operations capable of targeting critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, pipelines, and transportation nodes, etc.) with sustained, significant effects typically require highly tailored accesses and exploits. These are difficult to scale given the material resources necessary for their development and employment, and it is immensely challenging to continue to generate meaningful costs that can be sustained over time.[72] Recent examples of ransomware attacks against civilian critical infrastructure, such as attacks against pipelines and meat processing plants, have produced only minor, short-term disruptions in service.[73] Therefore, deterrence by punishment that solely relies on offensive cyber operations is likely to be ineffective because cyber warfare is an insufficient means to instill an unbearable level of fear and pain in an adversary.\n\n# Deterrence by denial\n\nUnlike deterrence by punishment, a strategy for cyberspace grounded in the logic of deterrence by denial may be feasible under certain conditions. However, denial has come to mean a range of different things to the point that its meaning has been diluted. At a conceptual level, denial has been used interchangeably with defense, whereas the traditional literature on deterrence by denial draws a distinction between defensive force postures for deterrence (Schelling's \"deterrent defense\"), and defensive forces that are actually capable of defending a state against an aggressor.

    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n549\n\nconflating denial and defense, denial strategies have largely ignored the more “offensive” elements of traditional denial approaches. Finally, from a U.S. policymaking perspective, the implementation of deterrence by denial has encompassed a range of instruments of national power, ranging from diplomacy to law enforcement. This significantly expands the scope of deterrence by denial mechanisms, which we argue is problematic. Below, we review “defense” approaches to deterrence by denial and discuss their limitations, and then articulate a deterrence by denial strategy for cyberspace based on “denial.”\n\n## Defensive approaches to deterrence by denial\n\nIn depicting deterrence by denial, the cyber academic literature almost universally defines denial as a function of defense.74 For example, Dorothy Denning argues that deterrence by denial offers the most likely prospects for success in cyberspace, focusing on “cyber security mechanisms and practices, including the regular installation of security patches, the use of strong methods for authentication, and the application of firewalls, black and white lists, intrusion prevention systems, antivirus tools, encryption, and so forth.”75 Similarly, Jacquelyn Schneider discusses different means of deterrence by denial in cyberspace, including improving basic cyber hygiene, hardening defenses, and augmenting threat information sharing.76 While Schneider acknowledges that deterrence by denial is technically feasible in some contexts (and certainly more so than deterrence by punishment), she posits that the strategy “by itself might not be able to credibly or effectively deter both low-scale malicious cyberspace activity and more significant cyber attacks.”77 Joseph Nye’s discussion of deterrence by denial focuses on improving resilience in addition to shoring up defenses, the logic being that if a state is more resilient and can withstand and rapidly recover from a cyber attack, it will buttress deterrence by making the attack less appealing in the first place.78\n\nThis is also paralleled in U.S. policymaking circles. For instance, the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy explicitly draws on a defensive form of deterrence by denial. The strategy directly references denial as an anchor of the strategy, noting that “[the] DoD must increase its defensive capabilities to defend DoD networks and defend the nation from sophisticated cyberattacks, and must work with other departments, agencies, international allies and partners, and the private sector to strengthen deterrence by denial through improved\n\n74Patrick M.

For instance, in December 2020, U.S. Cyber Command reported that it had recently conducted defensive cyber operations together with Estonian Defence Forces in which \"teams hunted for malicious cyber actors on critical networks and platforms,\" and then shared that information with public and private actors to improve critical infrastructure defense and resilience.[84] Also, since 2018, in coordination with other departments and agencies within the U.S. government, U.S. Cyber Command has released unclassified information about adversary malware in public information-sharing forums, such as VirusTotal.[85] In April 2021, U.S. Cyber Command and CISA released information, including malware samples gained from hunt forward operations, linked to APT-29, the Russian threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds hack.[86] In general, publicly releasing information about adversary malware, attacks signatures, and indicators of compromise can aid network defenders in identifying and patching vulnerabilities that are susceptible to the malware and developing signatures that can alert them to the malware's presence in\n\n79'The DoD Cyber Strategy', The Department of Defense, April 2015, 11.\nIt would be a misnomer to argue that the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy rejects the concept of deterrence outright.

    "their environment. This, in theory, contributes to defense by reducing the susceptibility to attack.\n\nOther U.S. strategy documents extend the defensive implementation of deterrence beyond the realm of pure military strategy to incorporate a range of other measures. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission's March 2020 report, for instance, states that its strategic approach “prioritizes deterrence by denial, specifically by increasing the defense and security of cyberspace through resilience and public- and private-sector collaboration.” Under this rubric, a range of actions that harden domestic defenses and improve resilience include improving incident reporting requirements, vulnerability disclosures, and patch management processes; building mandatory security standards for software developers; developing standards for internet of things devices; mandating resilience standards; improving efforts to share threat information within and across different sectors targeted by adversaries; and so on.\n\nHowever, these defensive approaches to deterrence by denial are not clear about what constitutes an optimal posture for a deterrent defense (e.g. some minimum defensive capability such that its credible communication to an adversary would reduce the likelihood of attack) versus actual defenses (e.g. those capabilities that are required to defend networks and systems in the event of cyber attacks). Additionally, the scale and scope of cyber vulnerabilities, the large surface area of attack, and the dynamism of the threat environment raise doubts about the feasibility of defensive denial approaches -- particularly those that do not narrowly define the specific set of networks or targets to be deterred from attack. In fact, this is the premise of resilience-based approaches, which are oriented around response and recovery in the wake of cyber incidents, rather than defense. As Dmitri Alperovitch noted in February 2021 Congressional testimony, reflecting on the SolarWinds hack, “organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity industry call an ‘assumption of breach' approach, where defenders operate on the basis that an adversary has already gained access to their sensitive networks.” This is not mean that investments in cybersecurity defenses are an exercise in futility. Rather, they are insufficient to serve deterrence purposes.",
    "552 E. D. BORGHARD AND S. W. LONERGAN\n\n## Denial approaches to deterrence by denial\n\nUnlike deterrence by punishment or by defensive denial, we argue that the best prospects for cyber deterrence center on a more offensive deterrence by denial approach. While defense is certainly a component of deterrence by denial, the traditional deterrence literature emphasizes that defense is not the primary mechanism for denial. Rather, as Borghard and Lonergan note in their analysis of cyber coercion, denial “could involve both a defensive component (increasing one’s own defenses such that an adversary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs), as well as an offensive one (actively taking out enemy capabilities to deny the adversary the ability to achieve an objective).”⁹² Building on the nuances in the deterrence literature on the distinctions between denial and defense, a theory of cyber deterrence by denial should include denial mechanisms as a central component. Below, we discuss challenges and limitations of existing denial approaches and articulate a roadmap for reconceptualizing deterrence by denial.\n\nTwo strands of cyber strategy and policy fall under the denial rubric. This first is cross-domain deterrence approaches that emphasize the use of non-cyber tools, particularly law enforcement tools (like indictments, extraditions, criminal prosecution, etc.). These aim to constrain an opponent’s ability to carry out cyber campaigns through denying freedom of movement for individuals and entities associated with a state’s offensive cyber operations or to disrupt ongoing malicious activities. The second is offensive cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive tools and infrastructure. Both of these are forms of denial, rather than defense, because they are targeted at adversarial offensive forces, tools, capabilities, and infrastructure – not on purely defensive measures. However, law enforcement tools are limited in a deterrence context.\n\n## Law enforcement as denial\n\nWhile not all forms of law enforcement activities serve deterrence by denial objectives, some could be used for those purposes, particularly given the interdependence between nation-states and criminal organizations in cyberspace. Both legal scholars and practitioners have described some law enforcement activities as part of a deterrence by denial strategy.⁹³ In 2014 Congressional testimony, for instance, the Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division described the logic of law enforcement actions in response to a question about cyber deterrence: “we\n\n⁹²Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 474.\n\n⁹³Aniket Kesari, Chris Hoofnagle, and Damon McCoy, ‘Deterring Cybercrime’, *Berkeley Technology Law Journal* 32/3 (2017), 1093–1134.

    "takedowns are meant to create increased operating costs. Additionally, law enforcement actions can enable “authorities [to] seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations ... [as well as] have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies.” It can also have secondary effects on behavior in a way that could make it more costly for actors to operate, such as “factor[ing] the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations ... [and following] much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection.”\n\nHowever, while in theory these types of law enforcement measures could operate as a form of deterrence by denial, in practice they have been limited in their success given their narrowness in scope and, by extension, the actual impact that law enforcement measures have on adversary organizations. The evidentiary and legal requirements associated with bringing an indictment against a particular individual are significant and often demand a long and painstaking process of evidence collection and adjudication. This is why there is almost always a years-long time lag between when a cyber event occurs, and when law enforcement action is taken against specific individuals held responsible. Therefore, even if one were to make the case that creating costs for organizations after the fact could have deterrence purposes over the long term (e.g. setting aside the fact that a law enforcement response is, by definition, not deterring that which has already occurred), the time it takes for law enforcement actions to do so would likely attenuate the deterrent effects.\n\nMoreover, similar to economic sanctions, the highly targeted nature of these actions -- affecting individuals rather than adversary government organizations or senior leaders -- significantly reduces the costs incurred on a state's ability to continue to carry out offensive campaigns and, by extension, the deterrent effects. It is highly unlikely that a state's offensive cyber programs depend on the availability of a handful of individuals. And while botnet takedowns could have broader effects on adversary offensive capabilities, depending on how they are carried out, the effects could be more transitive and groups could reconstitute a botnet relatively quickly. This suggests that this approach is limited in its ability to have deterrent effects through denying the adversary gains. That said, particularly given the overlap between criminal and strategic behavior in cyberspace, law enforcement actions that have more permanent and broader effects on an adversary's ability to carry out offensive campaigns could contribute to deterrence by denial -- provided they are rapidly implemented and clearly signaled.",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n555\n\n# A strategy of denial for cyberspace\n\nWe argue that that most feasible application of a denial strategy in cyberspace is one anchored in counter-cyber operations that target adversary offensive cyber capabilities and the infrastructure and organizations that enable it. The purpose is to make adversary military operations more costly by targeting their offensive capabilities and strategies, rather than focusing entirely on defense.¹⁰³ In this sense, we narrow the definition of cyber deterrence by denial strategy to focus on the employment of military cyber capabilities against a defined set of targets for the purposes of making it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive campaigns. The DoD's concept of defend forward is the closest allegory in practice to this approach to denial. However, it is problematic in terms of how it is has been described and there are gaps in conceptualization and, by extension, implementation. Below, we discuss the core components of a deterrence by denial approach, show how some elements of defend forward fit in with this framework, and then assess gaps and limitations and provide a roadmap for addressing them.\n\n# Core elements of a denial approach\n\nBroadly construed, a deterrence by denial strategy in cyberspace involves conducting cyber operations to increase an adversary's difficulty in conducting its own offensive cyber operations and campaigns. A key point that distinguishes denial in cyberspace from other forms of deterrence is that it entails maneuver and operations to achieve deterrent effects, rather than holding forces in reserve and communicating a capability and intent to use it. This is one reason why the analogy to conventional, rather than nuclear, deterrence is important. In the latter case, the use of force by definition means deterrence was not successful. For conventional deterrence, however, actually conducting operations could serve deterrent purposes rather than signal its failure.\n\n# Causal mechanisms of denial in cyberspace and assessing outcomes\n\nThe basic logic of denial hinges on conducting counter-cyber operations to increase the direct and indirect costs the adversary must pay for planning and conducting cyber campaigns against some core set of targets that a state defines as being central to its national security interests. In the United States, the latter often encompasses systemically important critical infrastructure\n\n¹⁰³ Pape, *Bombing to Win*, 29; Byman and Waxman, *The Dynamics of Coercion*, 79; Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion’, 56. The distinction between what constitutes a military versus civilian target is more ambiguous in cyberspace given the inherently dual-use nature of capabilities and infrastructure, as well as the relationships states have established with private entities. For further information, see Erica D. Borghard and Shawn W. Lonergan, ‘Can States Calculate the Risks of Using Cyber Proxies?’ *Orbis* 60/3 (2016), 395–416; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).",
    "processes and functions, including national defense critical infrastructure; the theft of national security intellectual property at scale; and interfering in democratic elections or otherwise undermining the U.S. political system. Counter-cyber operations could directly increase the costs of adversary offensive cyber operations through disrupting emerging operations, degrading adversary attack capabilities, or denying their ability to use attack infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, counter-cyber operations could have secondary and tertiary effects that make it more difficult for adversaries to carry out offensive strategies. First, if achieving these objectives is a strategic priority, adversaries will be forced to divert resources away from other lines of effort to surmount counter-cyber campaigns. Second, disrupting adversary capabilities and infrastructure may in some cases have an aggregate effect of disrupting what could have been infrastructure, organization, and capabilities that supported multiple different operations. The temporal pace of offensive cyber operations -- the fact that planning and conducting them demands extensive prior preparation, while at the same time the ultimate effect can be executed at rapid speed -- creates windows of opportunity to upend adversary planning, disrupt early stage campaigns, and deny and degrade associated capabilities and infrastructure.\n\nAn important caveat about deterrence by denial in cyberspace is that the deterrent effects of counter-cyber operations are cumulative and long term, rather than immediate. Conducting a single cyber operation, for instance, to disrupt a compromised server that an adversary uses for its own offensive operations does not deter that specific action in itself. However, carrying out cyber campaigns over time for the purpose of making it more difficult for an adversary to operate and thereby dissuading the adversary from conducting similar campaigns in the future is a form of deterrence by denial. Moreover, this kind of longer-term deterrent effect is not meaningless -- precisely because, in cyberspace, strategic effects occur cumulatively rather than as the result of a single action. Given that the effects of adversary behavior are assessed in terms of campaigns over time, rather than a specific operation, deterrent effects should also be evaluated as campaigns over time instead of single instances or events. The aim is to reduce the magnitude and frequency of specific types of actions over time by shaping an adversary's perception of the relative difficulty of its operating environment, even if it is difficult to deter a single episode.\n\nTherefore, a theory of deterrence by denial in cyberspace requires applying concepts in the conventional deterrence literature on measuring the dependent variable, rather than borrowing from the nuclear deterrence literature. Detractors of cyber deterrence erroneously anchor their pessimism",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n557\n\nin how the nuclear, rather than conventional, deterrence literature defines the dependent variable. The observance of cyber operations in itself should not be held up as an indication that deterrence has failed.¹⁰⁶ For example, Fischerkeller and Harknett describe deterrence as “a strategy based upon a threat of use of force with an operational objective of avoiding costly operational contact (i.e., the actual use of force).”¹⁰⁷ This is indeed the case for nuclear deterrence. However, as Schelling notes, in the conventional realm deterrence may take the form of “graduated deterrence” in which force is applied for deterrent purposes and does not indicate a deterrence failure, as we describe above.¹⁰⁸\n\nIn fact, in cyberspace, it is even more the case that conducting cyber operations are part of managing deterrence rather than an indication of its malfunctioning. In the context of conventional deterrence, denial typically works through adversaries assessing the relative balance of forces and capabilities to calculate rational expectations about the probability of success and the likely costs of carrying out a military offensive. For instance, the “shield” that was NATO’s forward defense worked in part by being visible to the Soviets. However, as already noted, conveying information about relative conventional military capabilities may require the actual (limited) use of force rather than solely issuing credible threats.\n\nIn cyberspace, making information public about offensive capabilities has the opposite effect as in the conventional realm. Rather than conveying evidence of capable forces, sharing information about cyber capabilities could provide attackers with the wherewithal to render them moot because they are perishable.¹⁰⁹ And, employing them often means an attacker may be relinquishing the ability to do so in the future.¹¹⁰ Similarly, as Martin Libicki notes, “[c]yber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target, which must be scoped to be understood. Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems, but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways. Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons, they are diminished in the showing.”¹¹¹\n\nTherefore, applying Schelling’s “graduated deterrence” to cyberspace, when states operate on a more routine basis in cyberspace to deny adversary\n\n¹⁰⁶ Fischerkeller and Harknett, ‘Deterrence is Not a Credible Strategy’, 387.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid., 385.\n¹⁰⁸ Schelling, Arms and Influence, 78.\n¹⁰⁹ Borghard and Lonergan, ‘The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace’, 458; Borghard and Lonergan, ‘Cyber Operations as Imperfect Tools of Escalation’, 134.\n¹¹⁰ Max Smeets, ‘A Matter of Time: On the Transitory Nature of Cyberweapons’, Journal of Strategic Studies 41/1–2 (2018), 6–32.\n¹¹¹ Martin C.

LONERGAN\n\noffensive capabilities, unlike in the conventional realm, the deterrence mechanism that conveys capability and intent to a target is not the capabilities that are revealed through those actions. That is because the demonstrated ability to obtain an affect against a particular network does not necessarily signal that the same set of cyber capabilities could be employed against a different target for the reasons described above. Rather, by operating, a state is able to demonstrate the level of its organizational maturity, skill, and ability to sustain complex campaigns over time. Conveying this kind of information through operating is what could yield a deterrence effect.\n\nSimilarly, the dependent variable in cyberspace should not be defined in binary terms, in which successful deterrence by denial is measured in terms of the absence of the cyber activity a state seeks to deter, while failure is measured by its observance.[112] Rather, cyber deterrence outcomes should be assessed in terms of deviation from an acceptable baseline level of activity (a continuous outcome variable). It is entirely unreasonable for a state to expect that it can successfully deter all instances of what it defines to be malicious activity in cyberspace. Therefore, states should reorient expectations around what they define to be acceptable levels of activity (what we term the baseline), for which there should be consistent and observable metrics (e.g., magnitude of effects of cyber operations, or frequency of a particular type of action or activity[113]).\n\n# Operationalizing a denial approach\n\nOperationalizing a denial approach should be roughly organized around two lines of effort. The first is operational. It entails planning, resourcing, and conducting cyber operations and campaigns to counter those of specific adversaries for the purposes of degrading and frustrating their offensive cyber capabilities complex. While cyber \"weapons\" are comprised of zeros and ones and cannot be physically destroyed, a state could take a number of measures to undermine an adversary's offensive capabilities. Reviewing all of these measures would be beyond the scope of this article, but several illustrative examples demonstrate how denial in cyberspace could be possible. For instance, a state could target adversary attack infrastructure, which refers to the infrastructure that enables a cyber attack to be delivered through the internet, including servers and routers that may be outside of the attacking state's sovereign borders that the latter has compromised (potentially unbeknownst to the host). A state could also engage in a range of actions that\n\n112For prior work on measuring the dependent variable in continuous terms, see Uri Tor, 'Cumulative Deterrence' as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/1-2 (2017), pp. 92-117. Also see Nadiya Kostyuk, 'Deterrence in the Cyber Realm: Public versus private cyber capability', International Studies Quarterly (2021).\n\n113However, it is important that observable indicators of deterrence outcomes appropriately capture what a state is seeking to measure. For instance, using the number of attempted intrusions as a deterrence metric may erroneously suggest that deterrence is failing when the reverse is true if a state has hardened its defenses such that an attacker has to expend greater resources to gain access.",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n559\n\naim to cut off the attack vector at its source. This could include working with third party entities, typically telecommunications or cloud service providers, to enjoin them to cut off the attack from its point of the origin. Further, a state could emplace a \"logic bomb\" on its own networks, or partner networks with their consent, which is malicious code that an attacker takes back to her own network which subsequently triggers a negative impact, such as wiping files. A state could also penetrate an attacker's networks during the course of, or following, an attack for the purposes of destroying information with which the attacker absconded, stealing adversary information, wiping networks, or other retaliatory measures.¹¹⁴\n\nBeyond targeting adversary attack infrastructure and offensive capabilities, countering the broader set of infrastructure and organizations that support adversary cyber operations and campaigns is an important component of denial. Planning and conducting cyber campaigns – not simply one-off operations but, rather, the sustained and deliberate employment of cyber power against multiple targets over time to achieve national strategic objectives – is a complex endeavor that is supported by mature organizations. Cyber operations and campaigns require significant investments in intelligence collection and preparation of the environment.¹¹⁵ Oftentimes, there are multiple organizations within an adversary government, or proxies affiliated with it, that play a role in implementing a cyber campaign.¹¹⁶ For instance, Russia's cyber-enabled influence campaigns to interfere in democratic elections, particularly the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018, have involved various organizations with different Russian government links. This includes APT-28, also known as \"FancyBear,\" which the U.S. government has linked to Russia's GRU; APT-29, also known as \"Cozy Bear\" and \"The Dukes,\" which the Estonian government has linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); as well as the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg associated with the Russian government.¹¹⁷ Each\n\n¹¹⁴ Erica D.

LONERGAN\n\nof these organizations is characterized by its own internal politics and may be in competition with other domestic entities over access to senior leadership and resources. Undermining these organizations and exploiting internal schisms within an adversary's military and intelligence units can serve denial objectives by making it more difficult for these organizations to operate. It is also important to note that this will vary across different adversaries; there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. An adversary-tailored approach should address the adversary's cyber strategy, capabilities, vulnerabilities, resolve, and relative interests at stake, as well as how these may change over time.\n\nThe second line of effort associated with implementing a denial strategy involves communication. This is a critical area where U.S. policymaking has been inadequate, which we discuss further below. Denial actions in themselves – in this case, counter-cyber operations – will not be able to serve deterrence purposes unless they are communicated as such. Taking measures to disrupt or degrade an adversary's offensive capabilities and infrastructure could be in furtherance of a range of non-deterrence objectives, such as coercion or preemption. This challenge is compounded in cyberspace because so much activity takes place in secret and states lack shared understandings or indices that could aid in matching observed action to intent.[118] Therefore, counter-cyber operations conducted for deterrence purposes should be nested in deterrence by denial strategies and communicated as such – secretly or in public – to the opponent.[119]\n\n# Application to defend forward and policy implications\n\nElements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on countercyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure as close as possible to the source, to either stop impending threats or reduce their effects.[120] For instance, the 2018 DoD cyber strategy posits that DoD \"will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\"[121] As described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in February 2019 Congressional testimony, the effort to counter Russian election interference has parallels\n\n118Robert Jervis, The Logic of Images in International Relations (Princeton University Press, 1970).\n\n119Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo, 'Covert Communication: The Intelligibility and Credibility of Signaling in Secret', Security Studies 26/1 (2017), 124-156.\n\n120United States, Congress, Senate Armed Services Committee, Advance Policy Questions, Nomination Hearing, 16 July 2019, 116th Congress, Washington, 2019 (Advance Policy Questions for Dr. Mark T.

Therefore, it is not clear whether defend forward is meant to serve deterrence objectives through a denial mechanism, or some other strategic purpose. This is problematic because, if defend forward is indeed supposed to be part of a deterrence strategy, as argued by some in the policymaking community,[124] an integral part of a deterrence strategy is how it is communicated, particularly to the adversary whose behavior the state aims to shape. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists about how the defend forward strategy in cyberspace is linked to, or diverges from, longstanding U.S. strategies and policies, such as different approaches to deterrence or forward defense.[125] Even more confusing, while the DoD released its cyber strategy in the spring of 2018, later that year the White House released its National Cyber Strategy, which did not contain any reference to defend forward - even as it discussed cyber deterrence strategy at length and enjoined the State Department to lead in building a Cyber Deterrence Initiative.[126] Moreover, different elements of the U.S. government use varying terms to describe defend forward. For instance, the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, in laying out different U.S. strategies for cyberspace, interchangeably refers to concepts of \"active disruption\" and \"persistent denial,\" neither of which is found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, or the 2017 National\n\n$^{122}$ Some might argue that the 2018 election defense efforts were not deterrence because U.S. officials believed Russia was determined to interfere. However, the U.S. may have been aiming to dissuade Russia from certain types of interference, similar to the U.S. attempt in 2016 to deter directly interfering with state voting tallies.\n$^{123}$ Statement of General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander United States Cyber Command, Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 14 February 2019, 4-5.\n$^{124}$ The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, for instance, argues that defend forward should be incorporated into an overall deterrence approach. Also see Senator King depiction of 'defend forward by strengthening deterrence of cyberattacks', https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-solarwinds-hack-highlights-need-for-increased-deterrence-of-cyberattacks. In another example, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated in his confirmation hearing that defend forward 'needs to be part of a layered approach', and specifically endorses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's approach. See 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of Dr. Colin H. Kahl To Be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy', Committee on Armed Services, March 2021, pp. 41, 54, 72-73.\n$^{125}$ For instance, in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's 2019 confirmation hearings, he links the DoD's defend forward strategy with deterrence, but it is not clear how the former serves the latter. See, 'Hearing to Consider the Nomination of: General Mark A. Milley, USA, For Reappointment to the Grade of General and to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff', Senate Armed Services Committee, 11 July 2019, 64-66.\n$^{126}$ National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, The White House, September 2018.",

LONERGAN\n\nSecurity Strategy. $^{127}$  Therefore, if defend forward is meant to be part of a deterrence strategy anchored in denial, the U.S. government should clarify it as such. $^{128}$\n\nA related challenge is that defend forward is often conflated with simply going on the offense in cyberspace and, by extension, punishment strategies.[129] For instance, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, testifying to Congress in July 2019 about the Trump administration's issuance of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 on offensive cyber operations, noted that, \"last year the [sic] put out a new NSPM-13, which really put our cyber capabilities on a more offensive footing, allowing us [sic] lean forward,\" and noted that, \"[o]n the offensive side, I think we have a lot of capabilities, but policy had not caught until, as you [sic] the passage of NSPM-13.\"[130] More recently, Colin Kahl, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted in his 2021 confirmation hearing that deterrence by punishment is the \"cyber equivalent\" of the adversary knowing that the U.S. will \"strike back in a way that will hurt.\"[131] While a denial strategy may contain offensive elements, they are meant to be circumscribed to a specific set of targets. In contrast, ambiguity about this risks creating the conditions for offensive cyber operations to be employed against a range of targets for a variety of strategic purposes, rather than more narrowly defined to encompass the set of offensive capabilities and infrastructure that adversaries rely on for the types of cyber operations that the U.S. is trying to reduce. Put simply, just as deterrent defense is not synonymous with pure defense, deterrence by denial is not simply interchangeable with offense. Clarifying the left and right limits of defend forward and its relation to broader strategic concepts is essential for its success.\n\n$^{127}$ John S.

    "Conclusion\n\nThe binary debate about whether cyber deterrence is feasible misses more nuanced questions about the thresholds at which deterrence may operate, how deterrence strategies may manifest differently at different levels, and how deterrence outcomes may be different in cyberspace than in other areas, particularly the nuclear realm. Moreover, cyber deterrence in general and deterrence by denial in particular have come to mean so many different things -- ranging from offense, defense, and resilience, and including nearly every instrument of power a state has at its disposal -- that they have lost conceptual rigor. This article set out to clarify the application of deterrence theory to cyberspace and revive the concept of deterrence by denial through drawing on the traditional denial literature, especially the conventional deterrence literature. We aimed to impose limits and conceptual clarity on how a deterrence by denial strategy could be implemented in cyberspace. Moreover, there are elements of U.S. cyber strategy, specifically the DoD's concept of defend forward, that could provide a foundation for implementing deterrence by denial, but are constrained by significant conceptual challenges.\n\nThat said, deterrence by denial still has conceptual utility, especially because it helps to clarify a state's strategic objectives. Counter-cyber operations to degrade adversary capabilities could be employed in support of a range of strategic objectives -- prevention, coercion, simply brute force. Therefore, a strategic framework that guides the employment of military capabilities is important. If policymakers ultimately seek to implement a deterrence by denial approach in cyberspace, it will require strategic clarity and discipline so that it does not become yet another empty strategic concept without clearly defined objectives and limitations.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank the Commissioners and staff of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, on which they both served, who significantly contributed to their thinking about deterrence by denial strategies in cyberspace and their policy implications.

    "abstract": "Many scholars and practitioners are unconvinced that cyber deterrence is possible. This article aims to demonstrate why some of this skepticism is misplaced, as well as provide greater clarity and conceptual rigor to the proliferation of arguments within the United States about deterrence in cyberspace. Specifically, we argue that cyber deterrence frameworks that draw from the traditional nuclear deterrence literature and the logic of deterrence by punishment are mismatched to deterrence challenges in cyberspace. Instead, we advocate for a deterrence by denial approach, but one that is oriented around counter-cyber operations rather than simply improving defenses. While there has been some scholarship and work by practitioners that implicitly rests on a deterrence by denial logic, they suffer from a lack of systematic assessment of how traditional denial concepts, especially those developed in the conventional deterrence literature, could be extended to cyberspace. Therefore, in this article, we review different deterrence concepts in theory and practice, articulate a logic of cyber deterrence by denial, and provide policy recommendations for the United States.
