Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\n\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”¹\n\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow,² various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability.³ Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.⁴\n\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n\n¹ Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n² 2023 Global Threat Report’ <https: global-threat-report=\"\" www.crowdstrike.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 December 2023.\n³ Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n⁴ James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\n\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\n\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\n\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\n\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\n\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\n\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16]\n\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew",

It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\n\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of\n\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22]\n\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is\n\n17 Kristen E Eichensehr, 'The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution' (2019) 67 UCLA Law Review 520, 582.\n18 Sandeep Baliga, Ethan Bueno De Mesquita and Alexander Wolitzky, 'Deterrence with Imperfect Attribution' (2020) 114 American Political Science Review 1155, 1-2.\n19 ibid 1; Eichensehr (n 17) 580.\n20 William R Detlefsen, 'Cyber Attacks, Attribution, and Deterrence: Three Case Studies' (Master's Thesis, US Army Command and General Staff College, Defense Technical Information Center 2015) 14-15 <http: ad1001276=\"\" docs=\"\" citations=\"\" www.dtic.mil=\"\"> accessed 31 December 2023.\n\n21 Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285, 296-297.\n22 Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita and Wolitzky (n 18) 3-5.\n23 'Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts' <https: 9_6_2001.pdf=\"\" eg10.=\"\" eg10.1017=\"\" eg10.1017=\"\" eg2001.pdf=\"\" internet=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\" lic=\"\" lic texts=\"\" instruments=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">.\n24 'Judgement of the International Court of Justice in the Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\n\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30]\n\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\n\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\n\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\n\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\n\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\n\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the\n\n28 This analysis was done as a part of my dissertation thesis (as of this moment it is unfortunately available only in Czech - https://is.muni.cz/th/lfryu/). The National Positions analysed are those of African Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. The approach of China to these matters was also considered, however, it was found irrelevant for the matter at hand. As the collective reference to each of the analysed positions would be senselessly long, see instead the related directory of the Cyber Law Toolkit: 'Attribution' (International Cyber Law: Interactive Toolkit, 28 July 2023) <https: www.cjcr.org=\"\" www.cjcr.org.=\"\" http:=\"\" www.cyber-operations=\"\"> accessed 14 February 2024.\n\n29 The legal attribution is essentially the determination of the responsible party on the basis of predefined legal criteria under the law of state responsibility (thus it is an act in the domain of international law). The legal attribution together with the breach of international obligation establish state responsibility, unlocking the possibility of legal-based responses (e.g., reparation or utilization of countermeasures). It is necessary to differentiate these responses from the retorsions (unilateral acts that do not need establishing state responsibility of the perpetrator).\n\n30 Given that state practice is a fundamental component of international customary law, I feel the need to underscore the simple fact that it is essential to draw conclusions from an analysis of current practices rather than outdated judicial decisions or the views of eminent publicists, which remain merely subsidiary means for determining rules of law as per Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court.\n\n31 'Attribution Tracker' <https: attribution-tracker=\"\" eurepoc.eu=\"\"></https:> accessed 18 May 2024.\n\n32 Tracking State-Sponsored Cyberattacks Around the World' (Council on Foreign Relations, 2024) <https: cyber-operations=\"\" www.cfr.org=\"\"> accessed 7 February 2024.\n\n33 Based primarily on the reasoning and work of following authors: Scott J Shackelford, 'State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem', Conference on Cyber Conflict - Proceedings 2010 (NATO CCD COE); Aravindakshan (n 21); H Berghel, 'On the Problem of (Cyber) Attribution' (2017) 50 Computer - IEEE Computer Society 84; Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, 'Attributing Cyber Attacks' (2015) 38 Journal of Strategic Studies 4; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita and Wolitzky (n 18); Jeremy K Davis, 'Tallinn Paper No. 13 - Developing Applicable Standards of Proof for Peacetime Cyber Attribution'; Garrett Derian-Toth and others, 'Tallinn Paper No. 12 - Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations'; William Banks, 'State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0' 95 Texas Law Review 1487; Dennis Broeders, Els De Busser and Patryk Pawlak, 'Three Tales of Attribution in Cyberspace: Criminal Law, International Law and Policy Debates' (1 April 2020) <https: abstract=\"3589139\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 29 December 2023; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges' (2020) 31 European Journal of International Law 941.\n\n34 The aspects of evidence disclosure and standard of proof were already in depth analysed.

As such, those\n\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report,⁴⁹ that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report⁵⁰ formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.⁵¹\n\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\"⁵² On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice.⁵³ A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem.⁵⁴ Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada,⁵⁵ the United Kingdom⁵⁶ and Israel⁵⁷) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"⁵⁸\n\n³⁹ Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).",

Vostoupal\n\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\n\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\n\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\n\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\n\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73]\n\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76]\n\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative.

And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\n\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\n\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\n\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\n\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\n\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\n\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\n\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,",

The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\n\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\n\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\n\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\n\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\n\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\n\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned",

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\n\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117]\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118]\n\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact\n\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\n\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\n\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125]\n\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such",

As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\n\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\n\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

            "markdown": "The next level of reactions involves retorsions, unilateral hostile acts that do not require evidence or invoke the attacker's responsibility. These may include economic sanctions, ICT infrastructure access restrictions, or severance of diplomatic relations (as witnessed in Albania's severance of diplomatic ties with Iran after cyberattacks in 2022). However, without legal attributions, invoking the attacker's responsibility and applying stronger countermeasures becomes impossible, thus limiting the deterrent effect. This underscores the most visible raison d'être of legal attribution in international relations.\n\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\n\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\n\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\n\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\n\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\n\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\n\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and",

It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\n\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\n\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\n\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\n\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\n\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\n\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\n\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.

There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\n\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\n\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were",

It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\n\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\n\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\n\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\n\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to",

And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\n\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\n\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\n\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-",

While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\n\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\n\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\n\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\n\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\n\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)",

As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\n\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\n\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these",

FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\n\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\n\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\n\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\n\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\n\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\n\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-",

            "markdown": "attribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\n\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\n\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\n\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\n\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\n\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\n\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\n\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Data availability\n\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”¹\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow,² various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability.³ Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.⁴\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n¹ Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n² 2023 Global Threat Report’ <https: global-threat-report=\"\" www.crowdstrike.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 December 2023.\n³ Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n⁴ James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16]\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nFig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22]\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is\n17 Kristen E Eichensehr, 'The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution' (2019) 67 UCLA Law Review 520, 582.\n18 Sandeep Baliga, Ethan Bueno De Mesquita and Alexander Wolitzky, 'Deterrence with Imperfect Attribution' (2020) 114 American Political Science Review 1155, 1-2.\n19 ibid 1; Eichensehr (n 17) 580.\n20 William R Detlefsen, 'Cyber Attacks, Attribution, and Deterrence: Three Case Studies' (Master's Thesis, US Army Command and General Staff College, Defense Technical Information Center 2015) 14-15 <http: ad1001276=\"\" docs=\"\" citations=\"\" www.dtic.mil=\"\"> accessed 31 December 2023.\n21 Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285, 296-297.\n22 Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita and Wolitzky (n 18) 3-5.\n23 'Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts' <https: 9_6_2001.pdf=\"\" eg10.=\"\" eg10.1017=\"\" eg10.1017=\"\" eg2001.pdf=\"\" internet=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\" lic=\"\" lic texts=\"\" instruments=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">.\n24 'Judgement of the International Court of Justice in the Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30]\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the\n28 This analysis was done as a part of my dissertation thesis (as of this moment it is unfortunately available only in Czech - https://is.muni.cz/th/lfryu/).

The approach of China to these matters was also considered, however, it was found irrelevant for the matter at hand.

The legal attribution together with the breach of international obligation establish state responsibility, unlocking the possibility of legal-based responses (e.g., reparation or utilization of countermeasures). It is necessary to differentiate these responses from the retorsions (unilateral acts that do not need establishing state responsibility of the perpetrator).\n30 Given that state practice is a fundamental component of international customary law, I feel the need to underscore the simple fact that it is essential to draw conclusions from an analysis of current practices rather than outdated judicial decisions or the views of eminent publicists, which remain merely subsidiary means for determining rules of law as per Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court.\n31 'Attribution Tracker' <https: attribution-tracker=\"\" eurepoc.eu=\"\"></https:> accessed 18 May 2024.\n32 Tracking State-Sponsored Cyberattacks Around the World' (Council on Foreign Relations, 2024) <https: cyber-operations=\"\" www.cfr.org=\"\"> accessed 7 February 2024.\n33 Based primarily on the reasoning and work of following authors: Scott J Shackelford, 'State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem', Conference on Cyber Conflict - Proceedings 2010 (NATO CCD COE); Aravindakshan (n 21); H Berghel, 'On the Problem of (Cyber) Attribution' (2017) 50 Computer - IEEE Computer Society 84; Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, 'Attributing Cyber Attacks' (2015) 38 Journal of Strategic Studies 4; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita and Wolitzky (n 18); Jeremy K Davis, 'Tallinn Paper No. 13 - Developing Applicable Standards of Proof for Peacetime Cyber Attribution'; Garrett Derian-Toth and others, 'Tallinn Paper No. 12 - Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations'; William Banks, 'State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0' 95 Texas Law Review 1487; Dennis Broeders, Els De Busser and Patryk Pawlak, 'Three Tales of Attribution in Cyberspace: Criminal Law, International Law and Policy Debates' (1 April 2020) <https: abstract=\"3589139\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 29 December 2023; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges' (2020) 31 European Journal of International Law 941.\n34 The aspects of evidence disclosure and standard of proof were already in depth analysed.

As such, those\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report,⁴⁹ that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report⁵⁰ formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.⁵¹\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\"⁵² On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice.⁵³ A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem.⁵⁴ Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada,⁵⁵ the United Kingdom⁵⁶ and Israel⁵⁷) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"⁵⁸\n³⁹ Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73]\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76]\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer\n59 Fon and Parisi (n 53) 302–304.\n60 Eichensehr (n 17) 597.\n61 ibid.\n62 Maurice H Mendelson, ‘The Formation of Customary International Law’ [1998] Collected Courses of the Hague Academy of International Law 165–166 <https: 10.1163=\"\" 1875-8096_pplrdc_a9789041112378_02=\"\" doi.org=\"\">.\n63 Even though the Court itself does not adhere to these rules at all cases, it is beneficial to work at some resemblance of a framework.

In this context, the ILC specifically states that constitutive aspects of the international custom (especially opinion juris) must be perceived as such by both states.

And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,\nthe progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned\nJ.

Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117]\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118]\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125]\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such\nas indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130\nAfter a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133\nSuch a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

These may include economic sanctions, ICT infrastructure access restrictions, or severance of diplomatic relations (as witnessed in Albania's severance of diplomatic ties with Iran after cyberattacks in 2022). However, without legal attributions, invoking the attacker's responsibility and applying stronger countermeasures becomes impossible, thus limiting the deterrent effect. This underscores the most visible raison d'être of legal attribution in international relations.\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and\nculminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.

There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were\navailable.190\nAlthough officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to\ngain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206\nIn May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition:\n“President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-\nranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)\nin an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237\nThe attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241\nAccording to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these\nattributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255\nHowever, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-\nattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow, various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability. Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n\n Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16]\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nFig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22]\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nreflected in the National Positions on the Applicability of International Law in Cyberspace,[28] where numerous states, including Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have begun to distinguish between political, legal,[29] and technical levels of attribution. Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30]\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nresponsibility regime, there can be no functioning legal system. The primary purpose of the law of international responsibility is for states to uphold the law, as opposed to the system of collective security under the UN Charter, which exists to maintain the peace. Thus, both systems use different approaches and tools, with the legal one usually being slower to react to changes.\nFor a long time, the law of international responsibility was focused only bilaterally, with no notion of anything resembling sanctions in criminal terms. However, after the First World War, this nature of responsibility, the impossibility of enforcing the interest in upholding the international order, and the international community's consequent instability were no longer sustainable. Since the international responsibility was primarily based on customary law, which limited broader debates over the specific content of individual rules, there was also a growing interest in specifying and unifying these rules. The first attempts to codify international responsibility occurred between the world wars under the auspices of the League of Nations, culminating in the 1930 Hague Conference of the League of Nations. However, despite many partial successes, these efforts have ultimately failed due to the unfavourable geopolitical situation. Thus, it was not until the drastic transformation of international relations after the Second World War that the United Nations International Law Commission (further only as the \"ILC\") could embark on its codification journey, which ended in 2001 with the introduction of ARSIWA to the General Assembly. While many experts dispute this codification's bindingness, in the context of attribution, the excessive work of ILC with the relevant cases of the International Court of Justice, state practice and proofs of opinio juris laid down a solid and reliable groundwork detailing the rules of attribution endorsed by States and even the International Court of Justice.\nHowever, even though ARSIWA made it much easier to work with and research the area of international responsibility, the customary nature of those legal rules has not diminished. The foundations of the law of international responsibility, including the attribution rules, are still based on \"a general practice accepted as law\" as stipulated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. As such, those\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report, that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\" On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice. A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem. Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"\n Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73]\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76]\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer\n\nreal-world documented cases of the principle's application, as emphasised by the USA and Israel), the disparities among the declarations of the states endorsing this principle in cyberspace (predominantly regarding the acceptance of the potential application of self-defence against those, who breach said principle), and the existence of several major objectors (inter alia USA, UK and Israel), one is inclined to agree with the objectors and conclude that presently, there can be identified no general customary rule of due diligence principle in cyberspace. And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,\nthe progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned\nJ.

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117]\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118]\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125]\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such\nas indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130\nAfter a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133\nSuch a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

UK and France, see 'Application of International Law to States' Conduct in Cyberspace: UK Statement' (n 56); 'French Position on International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace' <https://documents.unoda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/French-position-on-international-law-applied-to-cyberspace.pdf> accessed 3 January 2024.\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and\nculminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The first known cyberweapon (CSO Online, 31 August 2022) <https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html> accessed 5 January 2024; Zetter (n 13) ch 16; Jonathan Fildes, ‘Stuxnet Worm “Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets”' BBC News (23 September 2010) <https://archive.org/details/w32_stuxnet_dossier>.\n\npostponed the estimate for about three years in 2010),71 official acknowledgement of cyber warfare in Israel's defence doctrine the same year,172 or suspicious reactions of governmental officials when asked about Stuxnet (“wide smiles”).173 Some theories also pointed to the word “MYRTUS” buried in the code as a possible hint at Israel's involvement.174 However, in 2012, Mikko Hypponen, a Finnish malware analyst, emphasised that “American fingerprints were all over Stuxnet” from the early stages of its dissemination in the Middle East, challenging previous assumptions.175\nThis era of cyberattacks-handling was marked by distrust and secrecy. There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were\navailable.190\nAlthough officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to\ngain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206\nIn May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition:\n“President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-\nranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)\nin an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237\nThe attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241\nAccording to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these\nattributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255\nHowever, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-\nattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow, various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability. Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n\n Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16]\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nFig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22]\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nreflected in the National Positions on the Applicability of International Law in Cyberspace,[28] where numerous states, including Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have begun to distinguish between political, legal,[29] and technical levels of attribution. Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30]\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nresponsibility regime, there can be no functioning legal system. The primary purpose of the law of international responsibility is for states to uphold the law, as opposed to the system of collective security under the UN Charter, which exists to maintain the peace. Thus, both systems use different approaches and tools, with the legal one usually being slower to react to changes.\nFor a long time, the law of international responsibility was focused only bilaterally, with no notion of anything resembling sanctions in criminal terms. However, after the First World War, this nature of responsibility, the impossibility of enforcing the interest in upholding the international order, and the international community's consequent instability were no longer sustainable. Since the international responsibility was primarily based on customary law, which limited broader debates over the specific content of individual rules, there was also a growing interest in specifying and unifying these rules. The first attempts to codify international responsibility occurred between the world wars under the auspices of the League of Nations, culminating in the 1930 Hague Conference of the League of Nations. However, despite many partial successes, these efforts have ultimately failed due to the unfavourable geopolitical situation. Thus, it was not until the drastic transformation of international relations after the Second World War that the United Nations International Law Commission (further only as the \"ILC\") could embark on its codification journey, which ended in 2001 with the introduction of ARSIWA to the General Assembly. While many experts dispute this codification's bindingness, in the context of attribution, the excessive work of ILC with the relevant cases of the International Court of Justice, state practice and proofs of opinio juris laid down a solid and reliable groundwork detailing the rules of attribution endorsed by States and even the International Court of Justice.\nHowever, even though ARSIWA made it much easier to work with and research the area of international responsibility, the customary nature of those legal rules has not diminished. The foundations of the law of international responsibility, including the attribution rules, are still based on \"a general practice accepted as law\" as stipulated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. As such, those\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report, that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\" On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice. A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem. Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"\n Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73]\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76]\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer\n\nreal-world documented cases of the principle's application, as emphasised by the USA and Israel), the disparities among the declarations of the states endorsing this principle in cyberspace (predominantly regarding the acceptance of the potential application of self-defence against those, who breach said principle), and the existence of several major objectors (inter alia USA, UK and Israel), one is inclined to agree with the objectors and conclude that presently, there can be identified no general customary rule of due diligence principle in cyberspace. And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,\nthe progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned\nJ.

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117]\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118]\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125]\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such\nas indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130\nAfter a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133\nSuch a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 E.g. UK and France, see 'Application of International Law to States' Conduct in Cyberspace: UK Statement' (n 56); 'French Position on International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace' <https://documents.unoda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/French-position-on-international-law-applied-to-cyberspace.pdf> accessed 3 January 2024.\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and\nculminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The first known cyberweapon (CSO Online, 31 August 2022) <https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html> accessed 5 January 2024; Zetter (n 13) ch 16; Jonathan Fildes, ‘Stuxnet Worm “Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets”' BBC News (23 September 2010) <https://archive.org/details/w32_stuxnet_dossier>.\n\npostponed the estimate for about three years in 2010),71 official acknowledgement of cyber warfare in Israel's defence doctrine the same year,172 or suspicious reactions of governmental officials when asked about Stuxnet (“wide smiles”).173 Some theories also pointed to the word “MYRTUS” buried in the code as a possible hint at Israel's involvement.174 However, in 2012, Mikko Hypponen, a Finnish malware analyst, emphasised that “American fingerprints were all over Stuxnet” from the early stages of its dissemination in the Middle East, challenging previous assumptions.175\nThis era of cyberattacks-handling was marked by distrust and secrecy. There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were\navailable.190\nAlthough officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to\ngain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206\nIn May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition:\n“President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-\nranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)\nin an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237\nThe attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241\nAccording to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these\nattributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255\nHowever, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-\nattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.",

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow, various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability. Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n\n Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16]\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nFig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22]\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nreflected in the National Positions on the Applicability of International Law in Cyberspace,[28] where numerous states, including Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have begun to distinguish between political, legal,[29] and technical levels of attribution. Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30]\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the\n\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nresponsibility regime, there can be no functioning legal system. The primary purpose of the law of international responsibility is for states to uphold the law, as opposed to the system of collective security under the UN Charter, which exists to maintain the peace. Thus, both systems use different approaches and tools, with the legal one usually being slower to react to changes.\nFor a long time, the law of international responsibility was focused only bilaterally, with no notion of anything resembling sanctions in criminal terms. However, after the First World War, this nature of responsibility, the impossibility of enforcing the interest in upholding the international order, and the international community's consequent instability were no longer sustainable. Since the international responsibility was primarily based on customary law, which limited broader debates over the specific content of individual rules, there was also a growing interest in specifying and unifying these rules. The first attempts to codify international responsibility occurred between the world wars under the auspices of the League of Nations, culminating in the 1930 Hague Conference of the League of Nations. However, despite many partial successes, these efforts have ultimately failed due to the unfavourable geopolitical situation. Thus, it was not until the drastic transformation of international relations after the Second World War that the United Nations International Law Commission (further only as the \"ILC\") could embark on its codification journey, which ended in 2001 with the introduction of ARSIWA to the General Assembly. While many experts dispute this codification's bindingness, in the context of attribution, the excessive work of ILC with the relevant cases of the International Court of Justice, state practice and proofs of opinio juris laid down a solid and reliable groundwork detailing the rules of attribution endorsed by States and even the International Court of Justice.\nHowever, even though ARSIWA made it much easier to work with and research the area of international responsibility, the customary nature of those legal rules has not diminished. The foundations of the law of international responsibility, including the attribution rules, are still based on \"a general practice accepted as law\" as stipulated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. As such, those\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report, that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\" On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice. A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem. Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"\n Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73]\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76]\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer\n\nreal-world documented cases of the principle's application, as emphasised by the USA and Israel), the disparities among the declarations of the states endorsing this principle in cyberspace (predominantly regarding the acceptance of the potential application of self-defence against those, who breach said principle), and the existence of several major objectors (inter alia USA, UK and Israel), one is inclined to agree with the objectors and conclude that presently, there can be identified no general customary rule of due diligence principle in cyberspace. And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,\nthe progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned\nJ.

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117]\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118]\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125]\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such\nas indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130\nAfter a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133\nSuch a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

UK and France, see 'Application of International Law to States' Conduct in Cyberspace: UK Statement' (n 56); 'French Position on International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace' <https://documents.unoda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/French-position-on-international-law-applied-to-cyberspace.pdf> accessed 3 January 2024.\n### The relevance of legal attribution\n\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and\nculminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The first known cyberweapon (CSO Online, 31 August 2022) <https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html> accessed 5 January 2024; Zetter (n 13) ch 16; Jonathan Fildes, ‘Stuxnet Worm “Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets”' BBC News (23 September 2010) <https://archive.org/details/w32_stuxnet_dossier>.\n\npostponed the estimate for about three years in 2010),71 official acknowledgement of cyber warfare in Israel's defence doctrine the same year,172 or suspicious reactions of governmental officials when asked about Stuxnet (“wide smiles”).173 Some theories also pointed to the word “MYRTUS” buried in the code as a possible hint at Israel's involvement.174 However, in 2012, Mikko Hypponen, a Finnish malware analyst, emphasised that “American fingerprints were all over Stuxnet” from the early stages of its dissemination in the Middle East, challenging previous assumptions.175\nThis era of cyberattacks-handling was marked by distrust and secrecy. There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were\navailable.190\nAlthough officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to\ngain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206\nIn May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition:\n“President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-\nranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)\nin an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237\nThe attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241\nAccording to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these\nattributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255\nHowever, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-\nattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article."

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”¹\nAs cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow,² various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability.³ Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.⁴\nE-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n¹ Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\" default=\"\" sites=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n² 2023 Global Threat Report’ <https: global-threat-report=\"\" www.crowdstrike.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 December 2023.\n³ Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n⁴ James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\" cuploads=\"\" pfiles=\"\" stratcomcoe.org=\"\" pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008\nAvailable online 28 June 2024\n2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted, \"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6\nFurthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10\nRussia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though \"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong\nindication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12\nHowever, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored, thus initiating a new era of the arms race. Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly. Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).\nAfter Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nFig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace. The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels). However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below. Hindered by the difficulties of\nsecuring digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof, and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.\nWhile solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA) and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine). The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case); however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.

Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nreflected in the National Positions on the Applicability of International Law in Cyberspace, where numerous states, including Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have begun to distinguish between political, legal, and technical levels of attribution. Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court, \"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\" Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.\nTherefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks\nagainst Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice. These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard, also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned. To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law\nThe first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules in international law. The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying \"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\". It can even be said that without the\n28 This analysis was done as a part of my dissertation thesis (as of this moment it is unfortunately available only in Czech - https://is.muni.cz/th/lfryu/).

The approach of China to these matters was also considered, however, it was found irrelevant for the matter at hand.

The legal attribution together with the breach of international obligation establish state responsibility, unlocking the possibility of legal-based responses (e.g., reparation or utilization of countermeasures). It is necessary to differentiate these responses from the retorsions (unilateral acts that do not need establishing state responsibility of the perpetrator).\n30 Given that state practice is a fundamental component of international customary law, I feel the need to underscore the simple fact that it is essential to draw conclusions from an analysis of current practices rather than outdated judicial decisions or the views of eminent publicists, which remain merely subsidiary means for determining rules of law as per Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court.\n31 'Attribution Tracker' <https: attribution-tracker=\"\" eurepoc.eu=\"\"></https:> accessed 18 May 2024.\n32 Tracking State-Sponsored Cyberattacks Around the World' (Council on Foreign Relations, 2024) <https: cyber-operations=\"\" www.cfr.org=\"\"> accessed 7 February 2024.\n33 Based primarily on the reasoning and work of following authors: Scott J Shackelford, 'State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem', Conference on Cyber Conflict - Proceedings 2010 (NATO CCD COE); Aravindakshan (n 21); H Berghel, 'On the Problem of (Cyber) Attribution' (2017) 50 Computer - IEEE Computer Society 84; Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, 'Attributing Cyber Attacks' (2015) 38 Journal of Strategic Studies 4; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita and Wolitzky (n 18); Jeremy K Davis, 'Tallinn Paper No. 13 - Developing Applicable Standards of Proof for Peacetime Cyber Attribution'; Garrett Derian-Toth and others, 'Tallinn Paper No. 12 - Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations'; William Banks, 'State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0' 95 Texas Law Review 1487; Dennis Broeders, Els De Busser and Patryk Pawlak, 'Three Tales of Attribution in Cyberspace: Criminal Law, International Law and Policy Debates' (1 April 2020) <https: abstract=\"3589139\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 29 December 2023; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges' (2020) 31 European Journal of International Law 941.\n34 The aspects of evidence disclosure and standard of proof were already in depth analysed.

As such, those\nrules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as \"UN GGE\") 2013 Report,⁴⁹ that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report⁵⁰ formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.⁵¹\nMoreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress, \"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\"⁵² On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice.⁵³ A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem.⁵⁴ Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada,⁵⁵ the United Kingdom⁵⁶ and Israel⁵⁷) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have \"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"⁵⁸\n³⁹ Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\" 2013=\"\" 2023.=\"\" 25-33=\"\" 28-45=\"\" 40=\"\" 41=\"\" 42-45=\"\" 43=\"\" 44=\"\" 45=\"\" 46=\"\" 47=\"\" 50=\"\" 51=\"\" 52=\"\" 53=\"\" 54=\"\" 55=\"\" 56=\"\" 57)=\"\" 58=\"\" 59=\"\" 60=\"\" 61-62.=\"\" 62;=\"\" 63-63.=\"\" 64=\"\" 65=\"\" 66=\"\" 70=\"\" 7081351898041=\"\" 708135189853=\"\" 709253005002=\"\" 709853=\"\" 7098853=\"\" 71=\"\" 7180'=\"\" 72=\"\" 7250055=\"\" 7262002)=\"\" 72700411hayden.pdf=\"\" 72800412-cj.org=\"\" 729015=\"\" 73=\"\" 74=\"\" 75=\"\" 75.=\"\" 76=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 76-136-en.pdf=\"\" 77=\"\" 78=\"\" 79=\"\" 8=\"\" 8.=\"\" <https:=\"\" <https:=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2021=\"\" a.2024)=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).=\"\" a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal\nComputer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008\nSuch an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60 \"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61\nTo comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris. According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time). That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent) consistent and “sufficiently widespread and representative”, which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations. The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the\nContinental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions). States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).\nHowever, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge (a particularistic custom still can). States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.\nSo, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0) and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union, should any State object to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer\n59 Fon and Parisi (n 53) 302–304.\n60 Eichensehr (n 17) 597.\n61 ibid.\n62 Maurice H Mendelson, ‘The Formation of Customary International Law’  Collected Courses of the Hague Academy of International Law 165–166 <https: 10.1163=\"\" 1875-8096_pplrdc_a9789041112378_02=\"\" doi.org=\"\">.\n63 Even though the Court itself does not adhere to these rules at all cases, it is beneficial to work at some resemblance of a framework.

In this context, the ILC specifically states that constitutive aspects of the international custom (especially opinion juris) must be perceived as such by both states.

And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem\nA state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning,\nthe progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned\nJ.

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article \"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\" Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement. This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).\nTo illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).\nAnother critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group. These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28, the exact\nnature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers\nThe uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution, the complexity of the procedure, differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.\nHowever, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such\nas indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130\nAfter a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133\nSuch a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143\n### The relevance of legal attribution\nWith the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

These may include economic sanctions, ICT infrastructure access restrictions, or severance of diplomatic relations (as witnessed in Albania's severance of diplomatic ties with Iran after cyberattacks in 2022). However, without legal attributions, invoking the attacker's responsibility and applying stronger countermeasures becomes impossible, thus limiting the deterrent effect. This underscores the most visible raison d'être of legal attribution in international relations.\nThe broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution\nThree cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and\nculminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells\nThe story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.

There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were\navailable.190\nAlthough officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193\n### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming\nWannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194\nWannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199\nThe primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203\nDetermining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to\ngain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206\nIn May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition:\n“President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216\nThe attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219\nIn 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted .rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223\nThe involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a high-\nranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227\nHowever, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229\nIn summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes\nOn July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant)\nin an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237\nThe attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241\nAccording to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243\nThrough forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246\nFurthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these\nattributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255\nHowever, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions\nBased on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263\nThis change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these \"political\" attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265\nThe Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyber-\nattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268\nA potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273\nThe current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article."

Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility.\nThe legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## 1. Introduction The pervasive integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into various facets of society has undeniably yielded numerous benefits. From critical infrastructure and state administration to the individual household, the seamless incorporation of these technologies has significantly enhanced the ease, speed, and efficiency of our daily lives. However, the profound dependence on these technologies, coupled with a culture of convenience, introduces substantial risks on a global scale. As former President Obama pointed out in 2010, “The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.”¹ As cyberattacks’ frequency, economic ramifications, and complexity continue to grow,² various state actors have identified cyberspace as an optimal arena for projecting power and destabilising their rivals. The key allure lies in the challenges of attributing specific cyber operations to their perpetrators, thus offering them an ideal means of disguising their activities and plausible deniability.³ Nevertheless, many states initially underestimated cyberspace’s potential and challenges. The turning point occurred in 2007 when Estonia suffered major Distributed Denial of Service attacks that disrupted a significant portion of the internet-based communication of both private and public sectors, including e-mail and DNS servers, as well as causing the shutdown of banks.⁴ E-mail address: jakub.vostoupal@law.muni.cz.\n¹ Barack Obama, ‘US National Security Strategy’ 27 <https: default=\"\"files=\"\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"default=\"\"sites=\"\"rss_viewer=\"\"national_security_strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 4 August 2022.\n² 2023 Global Threat Report’ <https: global-threat-report=\"\"www.crowdstrike.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 December 2023.\n³ Justin Key Canfil, ‘The Illogic of Plausible Deniability: Why Proxy Conflict in Cyberspace May No Longer Pay’ (2022) 8 Journal of Cybersecurity 1, 1–4.\n⁴ James Pamment and others, ‘Hybrid Threats: 2007 Cyber Attacks on Estonia’ 54–56 <https: cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf=\"\"cuploads=\"\"pfiles=\"\"stratcomcoe.org=\"\"pfiles=\"\"> accessed 30 December 2023.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106008 Available online 28 June 2024 2212-473X/©2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of Cyber-incidents, timeline. Source: EuRepoC.\nNote as of 01/02/2023, the EuRepoC expanded its inclusion criteria. This can explain a spike in incidents from this period onwards.\nDuring this crisis, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet asserted,\"The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world, but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that, particularly in the early phase, some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian, and some of which were from Russian state institutions.\"5 However, the Kremlin promptly denied any involvement and demanded additional evidence, contending that many of the attacks originated from numerous countries other than Russia.6 Furthermore, the Russians pointed out that they cannot be held responsible for even the acts of patriotic Russians, not even those in governmental positions7 (even though the government has seriously stirred the patriotic movement).8 That ultimately led to a withdrawal of the Estonian Foreign Minister's statement, and not even after extensive investigation was Estonia able to officially attribute the cyberattacks to the Russian Federation.9 This attack did not convince states so much about the power of cyberattacks as about the benefits of involving the non-state actors because of cyberspace's unique asymmetric nature, where even a non-state actor's actions can severely impact a state's function. In its report on the 2007 Estonian attacks, the NATO Strategic Communication Centre of Excellence states that these attacks were specifically prepared to deny the state's attribution and create effective plausible deniability for the Russian government.10 Russia used the lessons from these attacks during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 to further exploit the cyber-attribution problem. Even though\"the timing of the attacks and the forensic evidence provided a strong indication that the Kremlin was at least facilitating the attacks\",11 the attacks could not be attributed to the state.12 However, it was the Stuxnet attack that proved to be the real gamechanger. For the first time, it showed that cyberspace has destructive capabilities on a level that cannot be ignored,[13] thus initiating a new era of the arms race.[14] Nevertheless, despite its impact, this gargantuan attack officially remained unattributed, at least publicly.[15] Even more surprising is that this status quo persisted even after the leaks proving the involvement of the USA and Israel (in the Olympic Games operation).[16] After Stuxnet, the utilisation of adversarial cyber capabilities grew J. Vostoupal Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008 Fig. 2. The Forms of Attribution (13.8.2023 - 13.2.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\nand slowly spiralled out of control (see Fig. 1), with notable incidents such as the 2014 Sony Entertainment hack, the 2016 USA election interference, the 2017 WannaCry malware, the 2020 SolarWinds malware, and many others.\nThis shift in the strategic competition of states has underlined the significance of cyber-attribution, i.e. the ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks to specific actors, as a critical linchpin for the domain of international relations and law. It is crucial to understand that attribution is not just a basis for the retaliatory actions (either under the law of state responsibility, sanctions or self-defence under the UN Charter); it is also an essential tool of diplomatic communication and specification of the norms governing states' responsible behaviour in cyberspace.[17] Without it functioning properly, the international community can be severely destabilised.\nThat is because central to the discourse on attribution is its profound relevance to the broader concept of deterrence in the context of cyberspace.[18] The prospect of unequivocal identification and the potential for facing repercussions can act as a powerful disincentive, potentially dissuading would-be attackers from engaging in nefarious cyber operations (on both macro- and micro-levels).[19] However, the efficacy of attribution as a deterrent is contingent upon a myriad of factors spanning technical, political, and legal dimensions, as seen in the cases mentioned above and analysed below.[20] Hindered by the difficulties of securing digital footprints that perpetrators often obfuscate, inflexible legal rules, unclear standards of proof,[21] and even geopolitical considerations, the attributions have lost much of their potential.[22] While solving everything wrong with the attribution process is beyond the limits of one paper (or person, for that matter), this article focuses on aspects of the evolving attribution state practice in search of the answer, whether the current state practice is still consistent with the customary law of attribution as codified by the Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (further only as ARSIWA)[23] and identified by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case (the effective control doctrine).[24] The effective control doctrine was adopted by many scholars and experts precisely because of the Nicaragua case (and the reaffirmation in the Bosnian Genocide case[25]);[26] however, there are fundamental concerns about its applicability and even general suitability in cyberspace.[27] This scepticism is J. Vostoupal Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008 reflected in the National Positions on the Applicability of International Law in Cyberspace,[28] where numerous states, including Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have begun to distinguish between political, legal,[29] and technical levels of attribution. Such an approach allows these states a way of accepting the legal requirements on attribution (including explicit acknowledgement of the effective control test that was done, e.g., by the Netherlands) while also creating a framework for making attributions that do not necessarily meet strict standards of international law. These attributions often take the form of political statements rather than legal assertions, indicating a certain level of doubt regarding traditional legal attribution procedures.\nA divergence in state practice could signify a shift in the international customary law of state responsibility, particularly signalling a practical rejection of the effective control doctrine within the cyber context. It is necessary to re-emphasize that it is the states who are the primary creators of the customary law, and the case-law of the International Court of Justice has, according to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court,\"no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\"Should the research reveal a deviation from the effective control doctrine, it may herald the end of unproductive efforts to adapt this doctrine to the cyber realm, thereby liberating states and scholars to focus on the contemporary state of the world.[30] Therefore, to verify the status of the contemporary state practice, I employ both the qualitative and quantitative approaches. Initially, I analysed data from the EuRepoC[31] and Council on Foreign Relations[32] datasets to determine the status of legal cyber-attribution techniques utilized over the past two decades. However, it is imperative to analyse relevant cases in depth to gain deeper insights, because the quantitative research showed a notable lack of legal attributions and the indepth analysis can show emerging cyber. For practical reasons, I selected three representative case studies: Stuxnet, WannaCry and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This choice was made based on the combination of their impact (both economic and strategic), academic relevance for the attribution procedure and suitability as demonstrations of potential evolution in cyber-attribution state practice.[33] These cases also represent distinct turning points in cyber-attribution evolution. Stuxnet exemplifies the era of non-attribution; WannaCry was the first major cyberattack that was politically attributed by a larger number of states (specifically utilizing the naming and shaming technique), and the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022 resulted in an unprecedented reaction (severance of diplomatic relations) backed by surprisingly transparent evidence.\nTo evaluate this analysis and assess the potentially divergent practice correctly, it is first imperative to provide a foundational understanding of the law of state responsibility governing the attribution procedure and the customary law identification process, explicitly emphasising the requirements on state practice.\nSubsequently, the article delves into the cyber-attribution problem, elucidating the root causes and exploring the implications of the effective control doctrine. I focus mainly on the effective control test and the legal requirements for the attribution procedure, which means that certain aspects, such as the evidentiary standard,[34] also significantly impacting cyber-attribution, are deliberately omitted or only scarcely mentioned.[35] To my knowledge, the consistency between legal rules and the current state practice has not yet been explored in a similar manner.\nFollowing these theoretical foundations, the article examines the mentioned datasets and scrutinizes the chosen case studies.\n# 2. State Responsibility and the Identification of Customary Law The first part of the theoretical groundwork belongs to the introduction of the overarching concepts. Attribution and its rules are integral components of the customary law of international responsibility, a framework that regulates the obligations arising from the breach of primary rules[36] in international law.[37] The concept of legal responsibility is a fundamental pillar of the law itself, represented in the saying\"ubi responsabilitas, ibi ius\".[38] It can even be said that without the J. Vostoupal Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008 responsibility regime, there can be no functioning legal system.³⁹ The primary purpose of the law of international responsibility is for states to uphold the law, as opposed to the system of collective security under the UN Charter, which exists to maintain the peace.⁴⁰ Thus, both systems use different approaches and tools, with the legal one usually being slower to react to changes.\nFor a long time, the law of international responsibility was focused only bilaterally, with no notion of anything resembling sanctions in criminal terms.⁴¹ However, after the First World War, this nature of responsibility, the impossibility of enforcing the interest in upholding the international order, and the international community's consequent instability were no longer sustainable.⁴² Since the international responsibility was primarily based on customary law, which limited broader debates over the specific content of individual rules, there was also a growing interest in specifying and unifying these rules.⁴³ The first attempts to codify international responsibility occurred between the world wars under the auspices of the League of Nations, culminating in the 1930 Hague Conference of the League of Nations.⁴⁴ However, despite many partial successes, these efforts have ultimately failed due to the unfavourable geopolitical situation.⁴⁵ Thus, it was not until the drastic transformation of international relations after the Second World War that the United Nations International Law Commission (further only as the\"ILC\") could embark on its codification journey, which ended in 2001 with the introduction of ARSIWA to the General Assembly.⁴⁶ While many experts dispute this codification's bindingness, in the context of attribution, the excessive work of ILC with the relevant cases of the International Court of Justice, state practice and proofs of opinio juris laid down a solid and reliable groundwork detailing the rules of attribution endorsed by States and even the International Court of Justice.⁴⁷ However, even though ARSIWA made it much easier to work with and research the area of international responsibility, the customary nature of those legal rules has not diminished.⁴⁸ The foundations of the law of international responsibility, including the attribution rules, are still based on\"a general practice accepted as law\"as stipulated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. As such, those rules are flexible, and it is therefore rather important to monitor the practice of States and search for a potential evolution, especially in an environment as volatile as cyberspace. Furthermore, the application and functioning of existing rules of international law in cyberspace is still unsettled. Although the UN General Assembly affirmed and endorsed the conclusions of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (further only as\"UN GGE\") 2013 Report,⁴⁹ that the rules of international law apply in cyberspace (and inter alia that States should not exploit proxies to hide their activities throughout the internet), the UN GGE 2015 Report⁵⁰ formulating specific obligations for the States to implement and improve norms of responsible state behaviour received much less enthusiastic reception. As Schmitt and Watts stated, it is evident that not every State is prepared and willing to limit its operations in such a manner.⁵¹ Moreover, there is not only the question of whether it is possible to apply the current rules of international law in cyberspace but also the question of whether they are suitable to be applied in such a way. As General Michael Hayden pointed out before US Congress,\"[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.\"⁵² On the one hand, it is understandable that cyberspace cannot be left lawless; on the other hand, some of the older concepts might need a slight readjustment, for if the States find these concepts and practices ineffective or inconvenient, they change their practice.⁵³ A prime example is the applicability of the principle of due diligence, sometimes referred to as a potential solution or mitigation to the cyber-attribution problem.⁵⁴ Whereas many States acknowledged this principle to apply even in cyberspace, several states (including Canada,⁵⁵ the United Kingdom⁵⁶ and Israel⁵⁷) have rejected this possibility with the United States stating that they have\"not identified the State practice and opinio juris that would support a claim that due diligence currently constitutes a general obligation under international law.\"⁵⁸ ³⁹ Charles De Visscher, La Responsabilité Des États (E J Brill 1924) 90 <https: 1=\"\"2013=\"\"2023.=\"\"25-33=\"\"28-45=\"\"40=\"\"41=\"\"42-45=\"\"43=\"\"44=\"\"45=\"\"46=\"\"47=\"\"50=\"\"51=\"\"52=\"\"53=\"\"54=\"\"55=\"\"56=\"\"57)=\"\"58=\"\"59=\"\"60=\"\"61-62.=\"\"62;=\"\"63-63.=\"\"64=\"\"65=\"\"66=\"\"70=\"\"7081351898041=\"\"708135189853=\"\"709253005002=\"\"709853=\"\"7098853=\"\"71=\"\"7180'=\"\"72=\"\"7250055=\"\"7262002)=\"\"72700411hayden.pdf=\"\"72800412-cj.org=\"\"729015=\"\"73=\"\"74=\"\"75=\"\"75.=\"\"76=\"\"76-136-en.pdf=\"\"76-136-en.pdf=\"\"77=\"\"78=\"\"79=\"\"8=\"\"8.=\"\"<https:=\"\"<https:=\"\"a=\"\"a.=\"\"a.2021=\"\"a.2024)=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).=\"\"a.2024).\nJ. Vostoupal Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 54 (2024) 106008 Such an objection may hint at a formation, or rather re-formation of the customary law in the context of its applicability in cyberspace.59 That may be caused by states finding contemporary legal requirements too constraining or unfit to apply in cyberspace, consequently forcing them to turn from a legal system to a policy-based one that is easier to manage and less predictable for rivals but also less stable and more egocentric. That is, as Eichensehr extensively analyses, an unwanted outcome, especially in the case of attribution procedures.60\"Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made.\"61 To comprehensively, effectively and correctly analyse whether the customary law still represents the current State practice, it should be examined according to the rules of identification and formation62 of international customs, as specified by the International Court of Justice.63 The ILC has relatively recently codified the identification rules in the Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law.64 The rules of formation are more complex and more challenging to apply methodologically; nevertheless, as Mendelson describes,65 there are many similarities, and for the purposes of this paper, they can be combined.\nBoth the rules of identification and formation focus on the specific qualities of the two constitutive elements of the international custom – state practice and opinio juris.[66] According to the International Court of Justice, the state practice must be uniform and extensive (not necessarily used for a long time).[67] That, however, does not mean that every state needs to practise it in the same manner. For any practice to become a general state practice, it must be internally (one state acts in similar situations analogically) and collectively (the practice of different actors must not be too divergent[68]) consistent[69] and “sufficiently widespread and representative”,[70] which means it needs to be practised by a majority of relevant actors without severe reservations.[71] The relevance of the actor is to be determined ad hoc, as the Court never specified this aspect. In the Continental Shelf case, the relevant actors were the naval powers and generally coastal states (the practice of a land-locked state in the matter of the law of the sea is understandably not as impactful). In the context of cyberspace, the relevant actors shall probably be determined based on the combination of owning sufficient cyber-capabilities, geopolitical influence (e.g., the permanent members of the Security Council) and the level of activity in influencing the debate (e.g., publishing press releases, statements or national positions).[72] States that are more willing to share their perspective (or at least part of it) will influence the perceptions of others whose practices are unclear. In this regard, Mendelson points out that the language in which practice is shared also plays its role (disseminating materials in a universally accepted language such as English will have a substantially more significant impact than sharing practice in, e.g., Czech).[73] However, given the current geopolitical situation in the international community, it is necessary to consider even the possibility of a negative influence of these representative States on the formation and identification of customs. Suppose an influential State that possesses significant cyber capabilities and is active in regulating the behaviour of States in cyberspace (e.g. the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China) openly rejects a practice. In that case, a general international custom is blocked by such an objection and cannot emerge[74] (a particularistic custom still can).[75] States may use these objections strategically to actively introduce a new form of state practice, especially if the new practice is more efficient and beneficial even for other states.[76] So, returning to the matter of due diligence and applying the aforementioned rules, despite its extensive scholarly defence (including the author team of the Tallinn Manual 2.0)[77] and its explicit acceptance inter alia by the whole of the European Union,[78] should any State object[79] to its application against it, the conclusions of the identification procedure will probably be negative. Based on the absence of widespread State practice (even the defending literature struggles to offer real-world documented cases of the principle's application, as emphasised by the USA and Israel), the disparities among the declarations of the states endorsing this principle in cyberspace (predominantly regarding the acceptance of the potential application of self-defence against those, who breach said principle), and the existence of several major objectors (inter alia USA, UK and Israel), one is inclined to agree with the objectors and conclude that presently, there can be identified no general customary rule of due diligence principle in cyberspace. And while a particular custom may still emerge, given numerous instances of opinio juris in state proclamations, the relevant State practice remains notably lacking in this regard.\nAs cyber-attribution poses a more intricate and challenging dimension within the law of international responsibility compared to the due diligence principle, a similar evaluation should also be conducted. This entails analysing whether there exists a sufficiently widespread, representative and uniform (both internally and collectively) state practice in line with the identified rules of attribution (inter alia application of the effective control text in case of non-state actors' involvement) or if states have diverged from these rules, potentially laying down the foundations for a cyber-specific custom. To arrive at a comprehensive conclusion about the existence of international custom, it would also be imperative to assess existing opinio juris. However, due to reasonable doubts regarding the likelihood of the assessed state practice meeting these criteria, this article will concentrate solely on evaluating the state practice aspect.\n## The Cyber-Attribution Problem A state is essentially nothing but a fictional construct acting through individuals, with attribution linking these actions to the relevant state. In the context of cyber-operations, there are essentially three categories of acts relevant to the question of attribution. In the first category, cyber-operations are mounted by state organs and individuals/entities “exercising elements of governmental authority”. Those acts, if done within the legal capacity, are attributable to a State. The same applies even to the matter of acts ultra vires. The only exception arises when the entity exercising state power acts in its own interest and private capacity. Examples may include a hacking group within an intelligence service or a private company legally authorised to conduct cyber espionage and defence.\nMoreover, in the Bosnian Genocide Judgment, the International Court of Justice extended the concept of state organs and persons exercising state power to entities that are de jure non-state actors but operate in total dependence and under the complete control of the state.\nThe second category involves the acts of non-state actors, which, in general, are not attributable to states, as the notion of absolute state responsibility (predominantly applied in the Roman period) has diminished throughout the ages, and the states nowadays do not hold each other responsible for every act of their citizens.\nThe third category is one of the primary causes behind the cyber-attribution problem: acts carried out by non-state actors under a state's instructions, directions, or control. This represents a unique category and an exception to the general rule mentioned in the previous paragraph, which also means that the link between the non-state actor and a state must be quite extensive to serve as a basis for attribution. While ILC explicitly differentiates the three terms mentioned within ARSIWA, Crawford points out that the terms direction and control were not distinguished in practice.\nA non-state actor acting on the instructions of a state could be exemplified in a scenario where a state has insufficient professional capacities to repel a cyberattack and thus commissions non-state actors for this operation to serve as de facto “auxiliaries”. The terms direction and control describe a much more complex relationship, with the degree of control affecting the attributability of non-state actors' actions. The International Court of Justice addressed this issue in the famous Nicaragua Case of 1986 (USA v. Nicaragua). As the United States withdrew in the context of this case its general jurisdiction declaration under Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice just two years prior to the judgement, the Court was understandably in a difficult position. Its task was to find a way of balancing the general rule of non-attributing the acts of non-state actors with the need to tackle the practice of using non-state proxies to project power and destabilise other states (as was the case of the USA and guerilla forces in Nicaragua). To justify the attribution, the Court devised a strict and demanding test known as the test of effective control.\nAccording to this test, it is not sufficient to just support a potential target or to “largely finance, train, equip, arm and organize” the non-state actor, but the State needs to be a party to both the planning and execution phase; to be in control of the beginning, the progress and the end of the operation. The non-state actor must also be in a position of relatively strong dependence on the State, especially in a way that it should not have the power, capabilities or resources to mount an analogical operation without the State's involvement or that the operation would have a much weaker impact in that case.\nThe reasons that led the International Court of Justice to introduce the effective control doctrine may be understood, especially in 1986. However, contrary to its own rules about customs identification, the Court has not based the creation of this test on a sufficient analysis of judicial and State practice. Cassese points out that “had the Court undertaken a close perusal of such practice, it would have concluded that it indeed supported the ‘effective control' test but solely with regard to instances where single private individuals act on behalf of a state, (...) international practice uses another test, that of ‘overall control', for the attribution to states of acts of organised armed groups acting on behalf of such states.” He further argues that the effective control test goes against the basic principles of state responsibility, meaning it offers a way of evading responsibility by using non-state actors.\nThe International Court of Justice had a chance to rectify the matters of effective and overall control (which was officially introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Tadić case) tests during the Bosnian Genocide case; nevertheless, it reaffirmed the primacy of the effective control doctrine and rejected the overall control test altogether (without providing any compelling arguments whatsoever). This decision was not greeted with enthusiasm, and its controversy is mirrored even in the concerns expressed by the then vice-president of the ICJ, Judge Al-Khasewneh, in his dissenting opinion (which has since been proven true and legitimate): “The inherent danger in such an approach is that it gives States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility.” For as Maćák points out, it is almost impossible to satisfy the test of effective control in the context of cyberattacks, both evidence- and control-wise.\nThe process of finding the evidence linking, e.g. a hacker group with a State is a complex procedure comprised of three levels of attribution -- attributing the cyber operation to a machine (also called a technical attribution), attributing the machine to a perpetrator (sometimes also called operational level of attribution analysis) and finally, linking the perpetrator and a State (also called a strategic level of attribution analysis). This makes the procedure extremely complex, requiring an interdisciplinary approach and frequent involvement of many parts of the government (including intelligence services), with each of the stages having its own challenges (nowadays, it can be said that the technical attribution may be the easiest of the lot, as the forensic technologies progressed.\nHowever, beyond procedural aspects, the cyber-attribution problem also stems from the differences in the natures of the actors involved. Both the effective and overall control tests are rooted in the behaviour of actors in conflicts primarily conducted on land. In this traditional setting, states historically exert the most power and control. In contrast, cyberspace presents a fundamentally different environment -- one that is freer, more anonymous, and significantly harder for states to regulate, rendering states considerably weaker in managing its native actors. Despite its critical importance to many national economies, cyberspace remains partially beyond the control of many states.\nTherefore, I argue that the level of control in cyberspace should be compared not to that on land but rather to that at sea. Historically, states did not have sufficient capabilities to fully control the seas, which were thus more ‘anonymous' and safer for privateers and pirates (non-state actors), making these two environments quite similar, particularly regarding attribution and peacetime attacks. In the maritime context, the level of control over non-state actors necessary to attribute responsibility was much more flexible. Sovereigns could commission privateers, direct and recall them, suggest targets, and limit their conduct, and even without being involved in every operational step, they would still be responsible for the privateers' actions (if done within the specified limits). This flexibility was born out of necessity -- sovereigns lacked the capacity to project their power and influence over the high seas, whereas non-state actors possessed the necessary skills, tools and autonomy, therefore offering a viable and cheaper alternative (that also promised a way of harassing enemies without the need to go to war).\nApart from the environmental contrasts, the aforementioned J.

Types of legal responses (1. 1. 2000 - 18.5.2024). Source: EuRepoC.\ndifferences in links between states and non-state actors on land and in cyberspace are also greatly shown in Healey's article\"Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\"Healey categorizes state responsibility for a cyberattack within a 10-level spectrum, highlighting various degrees of state involvement.[116] This spectrum reveals that, due to the unique characteristics of cyberspace, state involvement in cyberattacks can be significantly lower in terms of control and support compared to land-based operations (specifically state-encouraged, state-shaped, and state-coordinated cyberattacks).[117] To illustrate this point, consider the support needed to mount a successful kinetic attack against another state's critical infrastructure. Such an attack would usually demand extensive state involvement to mitigate risks for non-state actors, who lack the anonymity and geophysical distance provided by cyberspace. In contrast, most cyberattacks necessitate far less direct involvement from the state. This is exemplified by the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, where the attacking state only needed to shape and coordinate the attack to effectively paralyze the country (and by doing so, Russia maintained plausible deniability).[118] Another critical issue is the demonstrability of state involvement, particularly with state-integrated groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group.[119] These groups originated as independent hacker collectives cooperating with nation-states and were progressively integrated into state apparatuses. Their legal status is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the precise level of control and cooperation between the group and the government. Despite evidence of coordination and influence, such as with the notorious APT28,[120] the exact nature of their relationship with state actors remains obscure (and it is meant to be so).\nThe environmental differences, combined with the greater independence of hacker groups (non-state actors), allow states to exert minimal control over cyber operations while still achieving effective outcomes. This results in plausible deniability for states. In such an environment, the static legal requirements for attribution, particularly the effective control test, give States the opportunity to carry out criminal policies through non-state surrogates without incurring direct responsibility. Consequently, this situation will likely result in very few legal attributions.\n# 3.1. The cyber-attributions in numbers The uncertainty among states about the possible application of international law in cyberspace combined with the unclear standard of proof necessary for cyberattack attribution,[121] the complexity of the procedure,[122] differences described in the paragraphs above, a control test that is either extremely demanding or downright impossible to satisfy[123] and an understandable lack of political will to apply this imperfect assessment and publicly attribute in fear of misattribution or unnecessary escalation[124] hardly makes an optimal environment for cyber-attributions.[125] However, an analysis of EuRepoC Attributions data reveals that my assertion about the low number of legal attributions was still overestimated. Most attributions lack a legal nature (see Fig. 2), and those classified as legal (see Fig. 3) do not invoke the international law of state responsibility. Instead, they tend to involve national-level actions, such as indictments, or unilateral political responses, such as retorsions.126^{,} 127 Moreover, these measures often target individuals rather than states, as seen in the use of economic sanctions, such as the US sanctions against the Lazarus Group in 2022128 or the responses to the NotPetya attacks by the US129 and the EU.130 After a thorough investigation of the EuRepoC database and Council on Foreign Relations Dataset,131 together with the Cyber Law Toolkit,132 it is necessary to conclude that the state responsibility for a cyber-attack has never been invoked and that the legal attribution in the sense of international law has never been done.133 Such a legal-attribution abstinence may essentially be explained by one of three most probable causes:There are no cyberattacks to be attributed.The states are not willing to attribute.There are problems with the procedure and requirements for the legal attribution.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks (including those that are suspected to be backed by a state) is gradually increasing,134 it is safe to conclude that the first option is not the cause of the situation. As for the second option, Eichensehr points out that outside the armed conflict were, until 2017, political “attributions almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon.”135 Since then, the number of political attributions (including naming and shaming strategies) has also risen,136 so it is unlikely that legal attributions are not being used just because of states' unwillingness. Therefore, there might be a problem so serious that it either precludes states from invoking state responsibility or disincentivizes them from doing so. That is even supported by the fact that some states ‘resigned' on the legal requirements of attribution and declared that public attribution is a decision of a political, not a legal nature and that there is no legal obligation to publicly disclose any underlying information on which the attribution is based.137 Such acts greatly diminished the transparency and general value of legal attributions, and by doing so, they do not seem to support the conclusion of the UN GGE reports about the applicability of international law in cyberspace in this context.138 ### The relevance of legal attribution With the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law. After all, cyberattacks could potentially be resolved through backchannels or retaliatory actions (which may indeed occur in many cases). In fact, should a state become the target of a cyberattack, it has several options to consider.\nInitially, one option is to take no action.139 While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach avoids the risk of escalation, maintains diplomatic and economic relations, safeguards the state's reputation (especially if information about the cyberattack can be controlled), and avoids admission of victimhood (as seen in Iran's official reaction to the Stuxnet attack).140 However, the deterrent effect of this approach is relatively weak, particularly as the stability of the international community depends in no small manner on peer pressure.141 Therefore, this strategy is not ideal in the long run.\nAlternatively, diplomatic reactions such as demarches or protests can be employed, which are entirely unilateral and have no set requirements for application (such as evidence thresholds or levels of control). These reactions can still be conducted discreetly, limiting public exposure while informing the attacker that the victim is aware of their actions.142 However, public reactions, such as naming and shaming, not only communicate that the state was attacked but also imply a failure to secure assets, potentially harming its reputation and inviting further attacks. Additionally, the effectiveness of such reactions may be undermined if the attacker publicly rejects the proclamations and requests further evidence, which cannot be provided by the injured party (e.g. out of fear for intelligence sources) as was the case with the EU's callout against China during the COVID pandemic.143 ### The relevance of legal attribution With the absence of legal cyber-attributions, one might question the relevance of attributions as a tool in international relations and law.

UK and France, see 'Application of International Law to States' Conduct in Cyberspace: UK Statement' (n 56); 'French Position on International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace' <https://documents.unoda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/French-position-on-international-law-applied-to-cyberspace.pdf> accessed 3 January 2024.\n### The relevance of legal attribution The broader raison d'être of attribution lies in accountability, deterrence, conflict prevention, and norm development. Through attributions, states signal that certain behaviours are unacceptable. Legal requirements for attributions elevate them beyond mere political proclamations, offering stability, predictability, and recognition by the international community. When attributions adhere to established rules, other states may join in condemning unacceptable acts, and the international community can more easily look beyond individual intricacies of geopolitical context and collectively denounce cyberattacks perpetrated by specific actors. This makes it harder for attacking states to discredit the accusations.\nWhile attributions should not necessarily be the default response to every cyberattack, the value of transparency in international relations and the goal of normalizing state behaviour in cyberspace make attributions a necessary tool. And although the decision whether to attribute is primarily of a political nature, the law should still dictate how these attributions are made, ensuring they are viewed as more than just propagandist proclamations. Most of the states publicly attributing cyberattacks are Western nations, which are strategically competing with their Eastern counterparts. This dynamic can undermine the reliability of these attributions in the eyes of the broader international community due to the obvious geopolitical motivations behind them.\n### The emergence of cyber-specific rules of attribution?\nHence, akin to the due diligence principle, there are clear indications that at least some states consider the general rules of attribution, including the effective control doctrine, inefficient, impractical, and thus unsuitable for application in cyberspace. Despite some states proclaiming otherwise in their national positions, state practice clearly reflects this perspective. Certain states have already adopted their own attribution methods, and some have even openly declared their intentions to diverge from the legal requirements in the future. Given the complete absence of legal attributions, it is evident that current state practice has diverged from traditional rules of attribution, particularly the effective control test. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the aim of this article accordingly.\nWhile contemporary attributions may be termed political, they still constitute a part of state practice, emerging out of necessity due to the inefficiency of legal constraints unfit for application in cyberspace. Their emergence could potentially lead to the development of cyber-specific customary rules of attribution. If this trend continues, persistent legal scrutiny -- such as that by legal scholars -- of the effective control doctrine, a system disfavoured by states and practitioners, might diminish the significance of legal principles, points of view and opinions in the future evolution of the cyber-attribution process. Thus, in my opinion, the current debates on cyber-attribution should be more focused on the form of current state practice and its evolution, including the potential emergence of the cyber-specific rules, than on the descriptions of the cyber-attribution problem and attempts to readjust the interpretation of the general attribution rules to the cyber-context while ignoring the international reality.\nThe pursuit of cyber-specific rules could potentially enhance the efficiency of the entire system of international responsibility. It is crucial to emphasise that cyber-specificity does not negate the UN GGE conclusions of 2013 and 2015 regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace; rather, it builds upon them. While there is little to contradict the benefits of applying attribution rules in cyberspace (as stressed by Eichensehr), these rules require adaptation and transformation due to the unique characteristics of this domain. A mere re-interpretation is evidently insufficient for states and does not provide the necessary stability. Therefore, the three chosen milestones of the cyber-attribution practice should not focus on the potential divergence from the effective control doctrine. Instead, they will concentrate on common aspects that could establish cyber-specific rules of attribution.\n## Cases of the Cyber-Attribution's Evolution Three cases were chosen to analyse the development of the state practice and assess the reality behind the cyber-specific evolution discussed in the previous section. This evolution cannot be effectively analysed through quantitative research; instead, a qualitative approach is required.\nEach case chosen is from a different period of the cyber-attribution problem. The first case is the Stuxnet attack on Iran, the first destructive cyberattack that was never formally attributed. This case represents a period that started with the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and culminated specifically with the Stuxnet attack. It represents an era of “primitive” forensic capabilities hindering the attribution process and states' uncertainty about the process itself.\nThe second case is the WannaCry ransomware, one of the most infamous global cyberattacks. It marks a period of significant change in attribution practices as it was one of the first coordinated attributions. Nevertheless, the attribution procedure was far from being clarified, and especially on the part of the USA, the attribution was communicated chaotically, with a questionable deterring effect. The evidence backing the attribution of WannaCry was released later within the DOJ indictment against an involved North Korean citizen, inter alia proving a colossal improvement of forensic capabilities. The attribution had no specific international consequences, as the North Korean regime was already heavily sanctioned.\nThe last case concerns the cyberattacks against Albania in 2022. This attack was considerably less devastating, yet no less important, as Albania not only publicly attributed (and the Member States of NATO supported this attribution) but also severed all diplomatic ties with the identified perpetrator -- Iran. That is one of the most severe reactions in the context of state-sponsored cyberattacks and potentially marks the start of a new period where the attribution procedure, certainty, and capabilities are sufficient to answer the transgressions sufficiently or even invoke the responsibility of a state actor.\n### Stuxnet -- everybody knows, yet no one tells The story of the Stuxnet began to unravel in 2010. Security firms worldwide started to notice a strange worm in their clients' networks, especially within the SCADA systems. This 500-kilobyte worm (about ten times bigger than most of the malware of its time) was unprecedentedly sophisticated and capable of precise targeting. It was not trying to infect anything it could as other worms; it searched for systems operating on the Microsoft Windows OS with a specific Siemens Step7 software that enabled monitoring and controlling SCADA systems, such as centrifuges. After a more thorough analysis, it became evident that someone made this worm with a lot of skills and resources -- it exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities and was masked by two digital certificates. For a conventional black-hat hacker, this was an unthinkable overkill.\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the air-gapped facility, a place deemed untouchable by many, and disrupt, degrade and destroy the centrifuges enriching uranium hexafluoride gas. It achieved this by manipulating the spinning speed of the centrifuges while completely concealing this behaviour from the human overseers. The extent of the damage caused by this worm to Iran's nuclear program was not officially disclosed, but it is estimated that over 1000 centrifuges were destroyed, resulting in a significant setback.\nThe extensive resources required for mounting such an attack and the overall complexity of the worm made it highly unlikely that a non-state actor was the perpetrator. In fact, even among the states, only a small number possessed the necessary capabilities -- USA, Israel, Russia and China. However, only the USA and Israel would have had a motive to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\nAt the time, when the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged the attack, it was not yet clear which one of those two States was behind the attack or whether there was some sort of cooperation. The Stuxnet code, written in multiple programming languages like C and C++, displayed a high level of complexity, suggesting a larger team and extensive preparation, making it difficult to definitively attribute the attack to either suspect (given the capabilities of both America's NSA and Israel's Unit 8200). Due to the past conflicts, many considered Israel the more likely attacker. That was also supported by circumstantial evidence, such as suspicious changes in strategic estimations about Iran's nuclear weapon timeline (Israel's nuclear program).\nThe most severely affected country by this worm was Iran. Initially, many believed the high infection rate was due to insufficient cybersecurity measures. However, it soon became evident that Iran was the worm's real target, specifically its nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. The first known cyberweapon (CSO Online, 31 August 2022) <https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html> accessed 5 January 2024; Zetter (n 13) ch 16; Jonathan Fildes, ‘Stuxnet Worm “Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets”' BBC News (23 September 2010) <https://archive.org/details/w32_stuxnet_dossier>.\n\npostponed the estimate for about three years in 2010),71 official acknowledgement of cyber warfare in Israel's defence doctrine the same year,172 or suspicious reactions of governmental officials when asked about Stuxnet (“wide smiles”).173 Some theories also pointed to the word “MYRTUS” buried in the code as a possible hint at Israel's involvement.174 However, in 2012, Mikko Hypponen, a Finnish malware analyst, emphasised that “American fingerprints were all over Stuxnet” from the early stages of its dissemination in the Middle East, challenging previous assumptions.175 This era of cyberattacks-handling was marked by distrust and secrecy. There were minimal official proclamations explaining or commenting on the attacks, their scope, or consequences. The attribution process relied on limited technical evidence,176 historical and geopolitical context, signals and human intelligence, and other sources, but this information was essentially kept confidential.177 In the case of Stuxnet, the primary sources of information were not from Iran but from media and private security firms. And while Iranian officials made a few proclamations, warnings and denunciations, they did not explicitly name the attackers or officially attribute the attacks.178 It was not until April 2011 that Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's civilian defence, broke the silence, commented on the investigation's progress and openly blamed both the USA and “the Zionist regime” (together with Siemens) for the Stuxnet attack.179 Nevertheless, this remained the closest Iran came to formal attribution and invoking state responsibility.\nIran's careful and secretive approach can be understood not only because of strategic interests (e.g. the non-disclosure of the extent of damage or the existence and purpose of its nuclear program) or the uncertainty about the potential escalation but also because of the context and aftermath of Estonian cyberattacks of 2007. When Russia used (or exploited) the cyber-attribution problem to deny involvement in those attacks, it set an example180 that could have been followed even in this case, as this incident publicly displayed the complex and problematic nature of the cyber-attribution procedure.181 Furthermore, as Shackelford and Andres pointed out, “the science of tracing cyberattacks [was] primitive at best”182 at that time. So, because of the complex procedure, forensic problems combined with lengthy analyses, unclear standard of evidence, lack of experience and the unclear strategic benefits of such attribution,183 it is highly probable Iran made a choice not to attribute the attack nor invoke state responsibility.\nSurprisingly, Iran maintained its position even after leaks of US secret documents (later confirmed by Edward Snowden184) revealed that Stuxnet was a joint operation of the US intelligence services, likely the famed Equation group,185 with Mossad and other Israeli actors.186 The leaks proved that the Stuxnet attack was not mounted by non-state actors controlled by states, but by state organs,187 making its attribution significantly easier. The USA, adhering to the secretive nature of that era,188 never officially commented on the matter, instead focusing on investigating the leaks.189 For Iran, the strategic value of the potential public attribution did not improve; the perpetrators were already known, the risk of escalation persisted, diplomatic concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program were still on the table, and the time factor, combined with the uncertain success of invoking state responsibility, likely contributed to the conclusion that public attribution was not worth the trouble, especially when simpler payback options were available.190 Although officially unattributed, Stuxnet's impact on cyberspace was immeasurable. It set a precedent in the realm of state power projection, initiating a new cyber-arms race and deepening states' interest in cyber capabilities (both offensive and defensive).191 It also emphasised the critical role of a functional attribution for cyber-deterrence, for when a state chooses to forgo the protection of the law, including invoking responsibility and claiming compensation, it must fully rely on deterrence by a factual power,192 which requires sufficient capabilities to detect, identify and strike back.193 ### WannaCry ransomware -- of naming and shaming WannaCry ransomware plagued the world in 2017, marking a shift in cyber-attribution practices. States, especially in the wake of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, decided to abandon the uncertain silence, realising the unsustainability of such an approach. They were primarily inspired by the approach of the USA, the attribution super-power until 2017, which effectively utilised national procedures and criminal investigations of individuals responsible for cyberattacks as an efficient means to facilitate attribution (e.g. accusing five members of Chinese People's Liberation Army of stealing intellectual property in 2014), even though there was no invoking state responsibility.194 WannaCry was not as unique as Stuxnet; in fact, the code itself was unremarkable and of a “very low” quality.195 It was ransomware, a self-propagating type of malware that blocks access to data (usually via encryption) unless a ransom is paid. However, the technique of self-propagation and the related scope of attack made it infamous.196 WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability allowing access to files and printers on other machines on the same network without users' cooperation (which caused unprecedented fast collateral infection).197 This exploit was a part of the toolkit allegedly written by the Equation Group (a group under the NSA that allegedly authored or at least co-authored the Stuxnet worm198). It was stolen from the NSA and later leaked for everyone to use by a group called the Shadow Brokers.199 The primary principle was easy but efficient. Achieve the widest possible infection, encrypt as much data as possible and demand ransom. WannaCry authors demanded payment in bitcoins, about $300 per computer.200 The ransomware was operational for just a few days; however, the reports of its spread range from a massive 230,000 to 300,000 computers throughout 150 countries.201 Among the infected, there were also major firms and actors such as Telefonica, Renault and the UK's National Health Service.202 It could have been the most devastating cyberattack ever, were it not for the kill-switch unartfully hidden in the code and discovered by a British hacker, Marcus Hutchins.203 Determining the motive behind this attack was much more complicated than in the case of Stuxnet. The sloppiness, the kill-switch and the overall disruptive nature of the attack (especially in comparison to NotPetya) pointed to just a regular cybercrime hacker group trying to gain money.204 However, the inconsistencies described by Craig Wiliams, i.e. “high damage, high publicity, very high visibility to law enforcement, and probably the lowest profit margin we've seen from moderate or even small ransomware campaigns”205 hinted at least some level of state involvement (with the possible intent of harming the NSA).206 In May 2017, researchers of cybersecurity firm Symantec found earlier versions of WannaCry ransomware (even those still without the EternalBlue exploit) with close similarities to the tools, techniques and procedures used by hackers from the Lazarus Group207,208 WannaCry also showed similarities with the 2014 Sony Pictures hack (e.g. same zip file passwords).209 About two months after the attack, the NSA, in collaboration with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agency, claimed with moderate certainty210 that North Korea was linked to the WannaCry ransomware.211 In October, the UK followed with an official and public attribution of the attack to North Korea, which a North Korean spokesman called “groundless speculation” (the UK disclosed no evidence).212 UK's Foreign Office Minister for Cyber, Lord Ahmad, also disclosed that “the indiscriminate use of the WannaCry ransomware demonstrates North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions”213 but never openly stated that this attack presented a breach of international law.214 In December 2017, the USA also publicly attributed the attack to North Korea to promote “accountability”; however, it did not announce the imposition of any sanctions or other reactions.215 Thomas Bossert, who announced the attribution, then specified the following limitations connected with sanction imposition: “President Trump has used just about every lever you can use short of starving the people of North Korea to death to change their behaviour. And so we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour. It's nevertheless important to call then out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them. Some of the benefit that comes from this attributions are letting them know that we're going to stop their behaviour.”216 The attribution was also supported by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) and Japan.217^{,}218 However, there was no disclosure of any governmental evidence, so it was impossible to determine the legal title for attribution. Instead, the attributions and supporting proclamations cited evidence coming from the private sector (if they cited any evidence at all).219 In 2018, the Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer, Park Jin Hyok, of being one of the masterminds and hackers behind WannaCry, Bangladesh Central Bank cyber-heist and Sony Pictures attacks (inter alia) and provided one of the most detailed forensic analysis of said cyberattacks.220 In the case of WannaCry, the link between the attack and Park Jin Hyok was established through various elements, including shared access to encrypted.rar archives, command and control servers, and the use of common North Korean IP addresses.221 Moreover, the unsealed complaint linked Park to his employer, a firm called Chosun Expo (also linked to the infamous Lab 110 and Lazarus Group222), which was uncovered to be a front used by the North Korean government.223 The involvement of the government was also supported by an intercepted communication from an individual claiming to be a highranking agent of the North Korean regime.224 Nevertheless, the exact status of Chosun Expo / Lab 110 / Lazarus Group in the complaint is inconclusive. While the evidence presented therein proves governmental involvement, it does not specify if Chosun Expo is explicitly a part of an intelligence service or a non-state actor sponsored by and cooperating with the government -- crucial details for the attribution process.225 The DOJ's handling of the details of governmental involvement and its power over Lab 110 in the complaint also indicates that there was no application of the effective control test. Although the level of control and governmental involvement played a significant role in the attribution process, this complaint highlighted a significant challenge in the legal approach to cyber-attribution -- distinguishing the level of cooperation or involvement of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups in governmental structures to determine attribution basis (e.g. Article 4 of ARSIWA). Nevertheless, in the case of WannaCry attribution and the Park complaint, the states bypassed this problem by applying something resembling a version of the overall control test rather than its Nicaraguan counterpart. They relied on the overall evidence of the government's involvement and control over the actor without the need for further specification.\nApart from this observation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the way of attribution-by-indictment226 is a fine way of disclosing information and sanctioning individuals while maintaining their right to a fair trial, although the actual impact on the individuals or States behind them is minimal (especially if the hackers stay out of the extradition States).227 However, the reasons for this attribution's low deterrent impact, especially on the part of the USA, lies in the mixed messages it sent228 -- on the one hand, the USA is letting North Korea know that they are going to stop their behaviour, on the other hand, they openly admit that their capabilities in this matter are somewhat limited, their detection and deterrence is insufficient and that this attribution is nothing but “naming and shaming”, which is of a limited use (especially in the case of adversarial heavy sanctioned regime such as North Korea).229 In summary, the attribution of WannaCry marked a shift in practice with a coordinated call-out by the Five Eyes Alliance, establishing the basis for the naming and shaming approach. Despite its limited efficacy, this practice could still contribute to fostering responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Equally significant was the utilisation of evidence provided by the private sector and the introduction of attribution-by-indictment and other modes of evidence disclosure, which until then was often hindered by states' reluctance to jeopardise their law enforcement and intelligence sources.230 Nevertheless, the communication of this attribution was characterised by chaos, mixed messages, minimal diplomatic impact, and questionable contribution to “accountability in cyberspace”. That may be attributed to the relative novelty of employing these techniques on such a scale and the indirect involvement of the USA in the creation of this ransomware (utilising the stolen EternalBlue exploit).\nThe final significant aspect of this attribution was the apparent lack of legal terminology. No country openly asserted that the WannaCry attack constituted a breach of international law nor used any rhetoric that might hint at invoking responsibility.231 Eichensehr offers several possible explanations, including states not considering it a breach, disagreement on whether a breach occurred and which principle was violated, or states believing there was a breach but refraining from explicit classification due to concerns about public expectations of retaliation.232^{,} 233 However, she argues that for international law to progress, states must take more decisive steps and actions than mere avoidance of legal characterisation and naming and shaming tactics.234 Which is what finally happened in Albania in 2022.\n### Iran v. Albania 2022 -- of cyber clashes and diplomatic crashes On July 15th, 2022, Albania was hit by the first wave of destructive and disruptive cyberattacks pointed at the government's digital infrastructure to destroy it, paralysing services and hijacking data and electronic communications.235 Nevertheless, the attack failed in this aspect, as Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, announced on 7th September, and added that the damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor.236 This attack was a prime example of crisis management and cooperation as the Albanian government quickly coordinated with their NATO allies (mainly the USA) and Microsoft, which mobilised and deployed its Detection and Response team together with other experts of both governments and private sector (mainly Mandiant) in an effort to not only help with recovery from the attacks but also to find the responsible actors.237 The attacks comprised ransomware (ROADSWEEP),238 a disk wiper (ZEROCLEAR) utilised after the initial response by CSIRTs, a data exfiltration, and complex and extensive political social media propaganda.239 The attacks were claimed (both in the ransom notice and on Telegram) by a group called “HomeLand Justice”, which tries to make an impression that it is run by Albanian citizens.240 Its narratives are aimed against the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran -- Iranian opposition organisation, posing as a future government-in-exile, further only as MEK), whose members are in a political exile in Albania.241 According to the investigation by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hackers acquired initial access to the Albanian networks approximately 14 months before launching the attacks and maintained this access for at least a year, periodically exfiltrating e-mail data.242 The timing of the attacks was notable, occurring just before the World Summit of Free Iran. As a consequence of these attacks and associated bomb threats, the summit had to be cancelled, further underscoring the significance of the timing factor.243 Through forensic analysis conducted by various organisations, considering the scale of the operation, political dimensions, and the time factor, the Albanian government has firmly rejected the possibility that this attack was an independent criminal act but rather a state-sponsored aggression.244 In its report about the cyberattack, Microsoft states that it “assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit.”245 Namely, the forensic evidence linking Iran to these attacks includes:“The attackers were observed operating out of Iran.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers.The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests.The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor.The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors.”246 Furthermore, Microsoft reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the significance of messaging, timing, and target selection used in the attacks that also serve as retaliation for cyberattacks that Iran perceives were carried out by Israel (a group called Predatory Sparrow) and MEK.247 The reports made public by Microsoft and Mandiant extensively map the actions of the hacker groups involved and provide a transparent and high-quality basis for attribution (even though, due to the ex-post disclosure, it has a bit of an explanatory role), which came in September 2022.\nBased on the in-depth investigation by both State and non-state actors, the Albanian Prime Minister has publicly attributed these cyberattacks to the Islamic Republic of Iran “through the engagement of four groups that enacted the aggression -- one of them being a notorious international cyber-terrorist group, which has been a perpetrator or co-perpetrator of earlier cyberattacks targeting Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait and Cyprus.”248 After the consultation with their NATO allies, Albania has furthermore decided to immediately sever all diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and order every member of diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff to leave the territory of Albania within 24 h.249 An unprecedently strong reaction marking a high certainty of the attribution and determination to deter further attacks.250 The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this as unfounded claims and unmeasured and short of foresight; however, other States have supported Albania -- both the UK251 and the USA252 have attributed these attacks to Iran, and NATO acknowledged these attributing statements.253^{,} 254 The EU just condemned the cyberattacks and expressed solidarity with Albania but did not attribute to anyone.255 However, what is the status of the group EUROPIUM, also known as OilRig or APT34,256 which, according to Microsoft, was publicly linked to Iranian MOIS? FireEye, a cybersecurity organisation (now part of Mandiant under Google Cloud), first linked this group to the Iranian government in 2017.257 The link was based on “infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.”258 This connection was further supported by leaked details of APT34's leadership, “three of which work for Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, while the remaining work for Iranian cybersecurity company Rahacorp.”259 Therefore, the nature of this group is debatable (whether state or non-state actor. Still, from the disclosed reports of FBI,260 Microsoft261 and Albanian governmental declarations,262 it is apparent that the level of cooperation, shared interests, overall control, and other indicators mentioned above were sufficient to make this link. The test of effective control was once more omitted, and the level of integration of this group into the government was not a key aspect.\n## Conclusions Based on the analysis of the EuRepoC and Council on Foreign Relations Datasets, it became evident that legal attribution in the international sense has never been used, and international responsibility for a cyberattack has never been invoked. This highlights deep-rooted issues in the attribution procedure, including uncertainties about its correct functioning, the necessary and qualitative standards of evidence, limitations in forensic and intelligence capabilities, and the demanding nature of the effective control test. I argue that the basis of this test is incompatible with the fundamental nature of cyberspace, as it was created in the context of land-based conflicts. Instead, the environment and non-state actors in cyberspace are more akin to those found at sea rather than on land.\nThis, combined with the differences in links between states and non-state actors, the lower need for state involvement in cyberattacks, the absence of state practice using the test in a cyber-specific context, and limited (and fragmented) opinio juris, leads me to conclude that the effective control doctrine cannot be identified as a part of the international customary law of state responsibility in cyberspace, not it should be. The differences are too significant to be addressed by attempts to adjust the 1986 test to the realities of cyberattacks. Instead, the emerging state practice of “political” cyber-attributions may lay the foundation for cyber-specific rules of attribution. It is high time to abandon a test created by the ICJ (a supplementary source of international law) and return to analysing current state practices, potentially forming new particular international customs. This shift would effectively force the effective control doctrine to fall into desuetude in the cyber-specific context.263 This change could allow legal scholars to have a greater influence on upcoming debates, providing practical insights and constraints instead of insisting on an unworkable test that blocks the invocation of state responsibility and the use of legal countermeasures.\nHowever, despite divergence from the attribution rules interpreted by the ICJ and ARSIWA, the institute of attribution has not outlived its usefulness. Most states that have published their national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace agree that the law of state responsibility and attribution itself applies in cyberspace and is necessary. Although it may not be the default solution for cyberattacks (as there are easier and more covert alternatives), its value for stability, predictability, and the development of norms for responsible behaviour in cyberspace is undeniable.\nHaving established this divergence, I have turned to analysing the potential evolution in these\"political\"attributions, seeking emerging state practices and common aspects indicating the rise of a new, more flexible attribution test. I selected three milestones, each representing a different era of attribution practice: Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the Iranian cyberattacks against Albania in 2022.\nThese case studies reveal that cyber-attribution has indeed evolved, particularly since 2017. Attributions are becoming more transparent, even though states rarely disclose their own evidence, relying instead on information from the private sector. Attributions are also becoming more frequent264 and certain and involve a higher level of deterrent actions from states, especially when comparing WannaCry and the Albanian case. Interestingly, the magnitude of the attacks does not necessarily determine whether a state attributes or not, as demonstrated in the case of the Albanian cyberattacks of 2022, where the damage caused by the aggressors was minimal compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry.265 The Stuxnet non-attribution highlighted the significant role of non-legal influences in the attribution procedure, which was already shown during the cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 (inter alia, these attacks showed that there are states willing to exploit the cyberattribution problem). It underscored the challenges arising from a combination of technological forensic limitations and a legal attribution process that did not consider the specifics of cyberspace, along with the absence of a specific standard of proof necessary for making an attribution.\nOn the other hand, the WannaCry attribution marked a shift in states' approaches to cyber-attribution as a means of cyber-deterrence, even though the effectiveness of mere naming and shaming (a tactic employed in this case) remains questionable. However, this shift did not reach the legal domain, as the WannaCry case indicated that many States attributing the attacks refrained from using specific legal terminology that would hint at a breach of international law or the invocation of state responsibility. This trend was even more apparent during the reactions and attributions of the cyberattacks against Georgia in 2019.266 As Roguski points out, the lack of specificity and the absence of hard evidence blunts the impact and deterring effect of the collective attributions.267 Furthermore, Eichensehr warns that this approach may not block the formation of the state practice, only diminish the influence of those trying to block and bypass these problematic aspects, instead empowering the influence of active states and non-state actors.268 A potential and perhaps preferable solution to the evidence-gathering and disclosure problem emerged in the aftermath of WannaCry (the 2018 Park indictment) and the transparent reports on the Albania 2022 cyberattacks. This involves leveraging national law enforcement procedures, although this is deemed less desirable, or utilising information provided by the private sector, which is then adopted by attributing states. This approach helps protect state intelligence capabilities and, as demonstrated in the Microsoft report, may result in higher-quality grounds for attribution. It's crucial to note that the demand for hard, direct evidence traditionally required by lawyers in the attribution process is unrealistic and outdated. Circumstantial evidence, such as tactics, techniques, and procedures utilised by threat actors, indicators of compromise, motivation, timing, and geopolitical context, proves to be more useful and readily available in the case of cyberattacks.269 A smoking gun is seldom found in cyberspace.\nThe reaction of Albania's government also illustrates a shift in the understanding of cyber-attribution, as it has become a fully-fledged tool of foreign policy, not just a legal procedure (if it ever was).\nThe analysis of the WannaCry attribution (and the subsequent DOJ Park indictment) and the attribution of the Albania 2022 cyberattacks reaffirms my earlier conclusions: the general legal rules on attribution, as codified in ARSIWA or specified by the ICJ, are derailed in the context of cyber-attribution procedures. This compelled states to abstain from invoking state responsibility and rely more on one-sided sanctions and the deterring effect of factual cyber-capabilities.\nBy examining the specifics of the DOJ Park indictment and its connection of Chosun Expo to North Korea, along with the Microsoft report (augmented by the CISO and FBI report) linking non-state hacker groups utilised by Iran in 2022, it becomes apparent that attributing states do not employ the effective control test despite various opportunities. Instead, states appear to place more value on the overall link of influence, control and overlapping interests (and other circumstantial evidence).\nTherefore, even though this new cyber-specific attribution test is still evolving, two criteria that states value can already be identified: connection and influence.270 As evidenced, for example, in the Park Jin Hyok case,271 the attributions of APT 28 and APT 29 to the Russian Federation272 and the attribution of Iranian-based groups responsible for the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania to Iran, attributing states may not be certain about the specifics of the connection between the state and non-state actors (whether the hacking group is integrated, “semi-staffed” by members of intelligence services, externally controlled, or just hired and protected by the state), but this aspect is not really a blocking them from the attribution, as long as they can establish that a close connection exists. This connection must also encompass the influence the state exerts over a non-state actor. This is demonstrated particularly in the style of targeting, information campaigns, similarity of methods used, alignment of motivations, similarities in TTPs, technical capacity, and geographic location.273 The current state practice is still in the relatively early stages of shaping and unifying, and it will require much more research in the next few years. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyber-specific attribution rules may be hastened by the upcoming NATO Cyber-Diplomacy Toolbox, which could unify the attribution methodologies employed by the most attributing states and align them with those of the European Union, laying down the foundations for a particular cyber-specific international custom.\n## Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n## Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article."

    "abstract": "The cyber-attribution problem poses a significant challenge to the effective application of international law in cyberspace. Rooted in unclear standards of proof, evidence disclosure requirements, and deficiencies within the legal framework of the attribution procedure, this issue reflects the limitations of some traditional legal concepts in addressing the unique nature of cyberspace. Notably, the effective control test, introduced by the ICJ in 1986 and reaffirmed in 2007 to attribute the actions of non-state actors, does not adequately account for the distinctive dynamics of cyberspace, allowing states to use proxies to evade responsibility. The legal impracticality and insufficiency of the attribution procedure not only give rise to the cyber-attribution problem but also compel states to develop new attribution tactics. This article explores the evolution of these cyber-attribution techniques to assess whether contemporary state practices align with the customary rules of attribution identified by the ICJ and codified by the ILC within ARSIWA, or whether new, cyber-specific rules might emerge. By analyzing two datasets on cyber incidents and three distinct cases – Stuxnet, WannaCry, and the 2022 cyberattacks against Albania – this article concludes that the effective control test cannot be conclusively identified as part of customary rules within cyberspace due to the insufficient support in state practice. Furthermore, it is apparent that the rules of attribution in the cyber-specific context are in a disarray, lacking consistent, widespread and representative practice to support a general custom. However, emerging state practice shows some degree of unification and development, suggesting the potential for the future establishment of cyber-specific rules of attribution.",
