This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations\nManuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\n# I. Introduction\n## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³)\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴)\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵)\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest\n⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.¹¹⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.¹²⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.¹³⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.¹⁴⁾\nAs emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue\nIssues (UNGGE).\n10) First international treaty aimed at addressing crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, relevant to issues in cybersecurity law.\n11) Arpita Rout, Digital Sovereignty and Cyber Law, LEGAL VIDHIYA (Feb. 11, 2025), https://legalvidhiya.com/digital-sovereignty-and-cyber-law/.\n12) Andrew C.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.²⁰)\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.²¹) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)²²) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.²³)\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention. To combat unlawful interference in civil aviation, ICAO adopted Annex 17 in March 1974, establishing the first SARPs for aviation security.\n22) The 13th Edition (2022) of Doc 8973 and Annex 17 are regularly updated to address emerging threats and technological advancements impacting aviation security measures.\n23) Hanggongbeob [Aviation Act] art. 38-2 (aligning with Chicago Convention art. 18, a key aviation standard) (S. Kor.).\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\ninfrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.²⁴)\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,²⁵) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.²⁶)\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.²⁷)\n24) Id. art. 38-2 (S.

Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.²⁸)\nAviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.²⁹) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.³⁰)\nInternational law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).³¹) South Korea follows these standards through its Aviation Act No. 14114 and Aviation Act No. 14551, ensuring compliance with ICAO's cybersecurity protocols while fostering global cooperation.³²) As cyber threats evolve, frameworks like the\n(Network Security, Endpoint Security), By Deployment Mode (On-Premises, Cloud-Based), By Aviation (Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation), By Threat Type (Malware, Ransomware), By End-User (Airlines, Airports), By Geographic Scope And Forecast, VERIFIED MKT.

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nThe rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.³⁹) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.⁴⁰)\nSatellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,⁴¹) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.⁴²) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.⁴³)\nIn recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity\n39) EUR.

Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n⁵⁰) The \"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\" were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nGroup on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52)\nAs South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical\nthe sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n51) In September 2019, the US Air Force alerted the European Space Agency (ESA) about a potential collision between the Aeolus satellite and SpaceX's Starlink44. After Starlink didn't respond, ESA performed its first collision avoidance maneuver. This incident led to the launch of the Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Outer Space (3SOS) initiative by the European External Action Service (EEAS), addressing low Earth orbit congestion and promoting responsible space behavior, traffic management, data sharing, and satellite deorbiting. ESA is also proposing an automated risk estimation system to improve collision avoidance and protect space infrastructure.\n52) Sorin Docaru, Cybersecurity in Outer Space: A Q&amp;A with Ambassador Sorin Docaru, Digit.

NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.⁵⁶) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.⁵⁷)\nIn conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63)\nTo address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack\n58) Rebecca Herold, A Cybersecurity Framework for Mitigating Risks to Satellite Systems (Oct. 25, 2023), DARK READING, https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/cybersecurity-framework-mitigating-risks-satellite-systems/.\n59) Elton Chang, Cybersecurity Regulations for Satellite Networks, TELECOMWORLD101.COM (Mar. 25, 2024), https://telecomworld101.com/cybersecurity-regulations-satellite/.\n60) CSERA, Cybersecurity for Satellite Systems: Securing Space Communications, LINKEDIN (Jan. 1, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-satellite-systems-securing-space-communications-csera-1lo1f/.\n61) Sylvester Kaczmarek, Cybersecurity for Satellites Is a Growing Challenge, as Threats to Space-Based Infrastructure Grow, THE CONVERSATION (Feb. 20, 2024, 6:24 PM), https://theconversation.com/cybersecurity-for-satellites-is-a-growing-challenge-as-threats-to-space-based-infrastructure-grow-223877.\n62) Sven Dharmani, Case Study: How Real-Time Satellite Data Is Keeping Supply Chains Moving, EY, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-to-respond-when-certainty-is-a-missing-link-in-your-supply-chain (last visited Dec. 14, 2024).\n63) Kaczmarek, supra note 61.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nrobust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks.⁶⁴ Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation⁶⁵ and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems.⁶⁶ Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks.⁶⁷ Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

Similarly, UN initiatives on cybersecurity, including efforts by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aim to establish global norms, but their effectiveness is hindered by varying national interests and regulatory frameworks.77)\nSouth Korea has taken proactive steps to enhance cybersecurity cooperation, particularly through agreements with the United States and Japan to counter cyber threats from North Korea.78) However, these efforts highlight the broader issue: while bilateral and regional agreements may strengthen cybersecurity in specific areas, they do not provide a comprehensive global solution. The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms\nSouth Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^\nIn cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration\nforeignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nnecessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89]\nTo improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space\n86) Yim &amp; Park, supra note 78.\n87) Id.\n88) Garrett Shea, Republic of Korea Joins List of Nations to Sign Artemis Accords, NASA (May 26, 2021), https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/republic-of-korea-joins-list-of-nations-to-sign-artemis-accords/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n89) Evan A.

These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define \"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter\n90) Cyber weapons are difficult to define, as their effects vary. APSI notes that cyber technology often has dual purposes—attack/defense, peaceful/aggressive, legal/illegal. The modular nature of cyber tools allows legitimate software to be repurposed for destructive purposes. A narrow definition could be \"software and IT systems that cause destructive effects through ICT networks with no other uses.\"\n91) It can be defined as \"any space-based or terrestrial-based weapon that achieves kinetic or non-kinetic destructive effects in space, conflicts with the peaceful uses of space, and threatens to destabilize space security.\"\n92) In Article 4 of the Treaty, Cervino, Corradini &amp; Davolio (2003), as well as Henry et al.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\npretations.⁹³) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.⁹⁴)\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.⁹⁵)\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.⁹⁶) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space. Article 4(2) states: \"The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" However, there is no unanimous interpretation of \"peaceful purposes\" in the international community. Christol (1984), Markoff (1976), and Vlasic (1981) interpret \"peaceful\" strictly, equating it to \"non-military.\"\n⁹³) Danylo Stonis, *Ambiguities in Space Law as Path Towards Weaponization of Space: The Case of the Outer Space Treaty.

Efforts by international organizations like the Wassenaar Arrangement struggle with political divisions, hindering effective global regulation. International agreements remain inconsistent and politically driven, making global governance of these technologies difficult.^[97]^\nCountries like South Korea, a leader in digital innovation, face difficulties balancing technological sovereignty with international cooperation. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has been advancing technologies critical for defense and economic growth,^[98]^ including AI, quantum computing, and aerospace innovations.^[99]^ However, the integration of dual-use technologies within the defense sector is complicated by the reliance on chaebols, which are involved in both civilian and military production.^[100]^ This raises concerns about the oversight and regulation of such technologies, with significant inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.

Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, $^{110}$ and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges\n## 1. Regulatory Frameworks\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n111) Robert S.

The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113]\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118]\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120]\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations.

This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.¹²³) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.¹²⁴) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n¹²¹) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n¹²²) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n¹²³) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n¹²⁴) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule.¹²⁵ As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.¹²⁶\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n¹²⁵) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n¹²⁶) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127]\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128]\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130]\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively.

Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^\nTo address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law\nThe application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an \"armed attack\" under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^[133]^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^[134]^\n^[131]^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).\n^[132]^ U.N.

For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140]\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global\nCHATHAM HOUSE (May 2024), https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\n135) U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., 2023 CYBER STRATEGY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (2023), https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299076/-1/-1/1/2023_DOD_Cyber_Strategy_Summary.PDF?.\n136) Regulation 2019/881, 2019 O.J.

South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141]\nEffectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Compliance with International Law\nThe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142]\nA closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader\n141) U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., supra note 131.\n142) William M.

However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $^{145)}$\nThe issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing. While countries like the EU and the U.S. have developed robust cybersecurity frameworks for cross-border collaboration, South Korea's participation in these initiatives has been limited. $^{146)}$ For instance, South Korea has yet to fully engage in cooperative frameworks like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which fosters cross-border data protection and cybersecurity collaboration.

The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations. To achieve this, the country must adopt a more proactive approach by aligning its national policies with international standards and engaging in multilateral cybersecurity efforts.^[148]^ Initiatives like the EU's Digital Single Market and U.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151]\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152]\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure\nAerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace\n153) G. A.

However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.¹⁵⁶\nSouth Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation.¹⁵⁷ This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n¹⁵⁵ THOMAS M.

Conclusion\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nbalancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]",

Introduction\n## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.)\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.)\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.)\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.

Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.⁾\nAs emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue\nIssues (UNGGE).\n10) First international treaty aimed at addressing crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, relevant to issues in cybersecurity law.\n11) Arpita Rout, Digital Sovereignty and Cyber Law, LEGAL VIDHIYA (Feb. 11, 2025), https://legalvidhiya.com/digital-sovereignty-and-cyber-law/.\n12) Andrew C.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.)\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.)\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention. To combat unlawful interference in civil aviation, ICAO adopted Annex 17 in March 1974, establishing the first SARPs for aviation security.\n22) The 13th Edition (2022) of Doc 8973 and Annex 17 are regularly updated to address emerging threats and technological advancements impacting aviation security measures.\n23) Hanggongbeob [Aviation Act] art. 38-2 (aligning with Chicago Convention art. 18, a key aviation standard) (S. Kor.).\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\ninfrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.)\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.)\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations.

The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.)\nAviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.)\nInternational law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).)

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nThe rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.)\nSatellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.)\nIn recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity\n39) EUR.

It called for stakeholder-specific actions, including prioritizing the development of norms and standards in collaboration with like-minded partners.) The changing dynamics of space security and the infusion of geopolitical rivalry further complicate matters, making international cooperation even more crucial.) This includes the need for norms, standards, best practices, and regulations to prevent interference with satellite operations. However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.)\nInternational regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space. Several initiatives, including the U.N.'s Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2019),) the EU's 3SOS initiative, and the U.N. Open-ended Working\n) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n) G.A.

Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n) The \"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\" were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nGroup on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52)\nAs South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical\nthe sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n51) In September 2019, the US Air Force alerted the European Space Agency (ESA) about a potential collision between the Aeolus satellite and SpaceX's Starlink44. After Starlink didn't respond, ESA performed its first collision avoidance maneuver. This incident led to the launch of the Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Outer Space (3SOS) initiative by the European External Action Service (EEAS), addressing low Earth orbit congestion and promoting responsible space behavior, traffic management, data sharing, and satellite deorbiting. ESA is also proposing an automated risk estimation system to improve collision avoidance and protect space infrastructure.\n52) Sorin Docaru, Cybersecurity in Outer Space: A Q&amp;A with Ambassador Sorin Docaru, Digit.

NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.)\nIn conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63)\nTo address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack\n58) Rebecca Herold, A Cybersecurity Framework for Mitigating Risks to Satellite Systems (Oct. 25, 2023), DARK READING, https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/cybersecurity-framework-mitigating-risks-satellite-systems/.\n59) Elton Chang, Cybersecurity Regulations for Satellite Networks, TELECOMWORLD101.COM (Mar. 25, 2024), https://telecomworld101.com/cybersecurity-regulations-satellite/.\n60) CSERA, Cybersecurity for Satellite Systems: Securing Space Communications, LINKEDIN (Jan. 1, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-satellite-systems-securing-space-communications-csera-1lo1f/.\n61) Sylvester Kaczmarek, Cybersecurity for Satellites Is a Growing Challenge, as Threats to Space-Based Infrastructure Grow, THE CONVERSATION (Feb. 20, 2024, 6:24 PM), https://theconversation.com/cybersecurity-for-satellites-is-a-growing-challenge-as-threats-to-space-based-infrastructure-grow-223877.\n62) Sven Dharmani, Case Study: How Real-Time Satellite Data Is Keeping Supply Chains Moving, EY, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-to-respond-when-certainty-is-a-missing-link-in-your-supply-chain (last visited Dec. 14, 2024).\n63) Kaczmarek, supra note 61.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nrobust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks. Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems. Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks. Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

However, domestically, South Korea has faced criticism for its censorship regulations, which some view as trade barriers under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement.) Critics argue that these laws not only undermine the competitiveness of domestic companies but could also inadvertently assist North Korea by revealing sensitive military locations through discrepancies between censored and uncensored satellite images.) This situation raises concerns about the balance between national security and global competitiveness in the space sector.\nAlthough international space law, particularly treaties like the Outer Space Treaty, provided a foundation for space governance, these agreements, created in the 1960s and 1970s, have struggled to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology.) As space systems become more complex and cyber threats continue to rise, there's a clear need for more flexible and responsive regulatory frameworks. The existing treaties were drafted when space technology was far simpler, and they leave important gaps in addressing modern risks, such as cyber-attacks.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms\nSouth Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^\nIn cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration\nforeignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nnecessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89]\nTo improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space\n86) Yim &amp; Park, supra note 78.\n87) Id.\n88) Garrett Shea, Republic of Korea Joins List of Nations to Sign Artemis Accords, NASA (May 26, 2021), https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/republic-of-korea-joins-list-of-nations-to-sign-artemis-accords/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n89) Evan A.

These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define \"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter\n90) Cyber weapons are difficult to define, as their effects vary. APSI notes that cyber technology often has dual purposes—attack/defense, peaceful/aggressive, legal/illegal. The modular nature of cyber tools allows legitimate software to be repurposed for destructive purposes. A narrow definition could be \"software and IT systems that cause destructive effects through ICT networks with no other uses.\"\n91) It can be defined as \"any space-based or terrestrial-based weapon that achieves kinetic or non-kinetic destructive effects in space, conflicts with the peaceful uses of space, and threatens to destabilize space security.\"\n92) In Article 4 of the Treaty, Cervino, Corradini &amp; Davolio (2003), as well as Henry et al.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\npretations.) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.)\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.)\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space. Article 4(2) states: \"The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" However, there is no unanimous interpretation of \"peaceful purposes\" in the international community. Christol (1984), Markoff (1976), and Vlasic (1981) interpret \"peaceful\" strictly, equating it to \"non-military.\"\n) Danylo Stonis, *Ambiguities in Space Law as Path Towards Weaponization of Space: The Case of the Outer Space Treaty.

Dual-Use Technologies in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe regulation of dual-use technologies, such as AI and space systems, presents significant challenges due to their military and civilian applications. Technologies like anti-satellite systems and satellite communication complicate arms control and export restrictions because they cross borders without traceability. Efforts by international organizations like the Wassenaar Arrangement struggle with political divisions, hindering effective global regulation. International agreements remain inconsistent and politically driven, making global governance of these technologies difficult.^[97]^\nCountries like South Korea, a leader in digital innovation, face difficulties balancing technological sovereignty with international cooperation. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has been advancing technologies critical for defense and economic growth,^[98]^ including AI, quantum computing, and aerospace innovations.^[99]^ However, the integration of dual-use technologies within the defense sector is complicated by the reliance on chaebols, which are involved in both civilian and military production.^[100]^ This raises concerns about the oversight and regulation of such technologies, with significant inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks. National positions on defense and economic priorities often diverge, complicating global consensus on these matters.^[101]^\nIn 2023, South Korea introduced the \"Defense Innovation 4.0\" initiative\n^[97]^ Guangyu Qiao-Franco &amp; Mahmoud Javadi, *Symposium on Military AI and the Law of Armed Conflict: Navigating the Governance of Dual-Use Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Times of Geopolitical Rivalries*, OPINIO JURIS (Apr. 3, 2024), https://opiniojuris.org/2024/04/03/symposium-on-military-ai-and-the-law-of-armed-conflict-navigating-the-governance-of-dual-use-artificial-intelligence-technologies-in-times-of-geopolitical-rivalries/.\n^[98]^ *South Korea Additive Manufacturing*, U.S. DEP'T OF COM.

Despite these efforts, defining terms like “cyber weapons” and “military-use technologies” remains challenging, as commercial technologies can be easily adapted for military purposes, complicating arms control and international agreements.\nInternational legal frameworks like the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) govern the export of dual-use technologies, but they are not universally applied, with gaps in compliance across nations. South Korea’s approach to aerospace cybersecurity is influenced by these international norms, but there are gaps in domestic compliance. For instance, compliance with regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is essential for entities involved in defense technologies, yet countries with different regulatory standards often struggle to reach agreement on their application.\nCollaboration with international partners further complicates legal compliance. For instance, South Korea’s partnerships with Finnish companies in quantum technology involve dealing with complex export control laws.

Key legal issues include unclear definitions, lack of global standards, and discrepancies in domestic and international regulations. Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, $^{110}$ and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges\n## 1. Regulatory Frameworks\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n111) Robert S.

The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113]\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118]\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120]\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space\n119) Space Law Treaties and Principles, U.N. OFF.

However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule. As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127]\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128]\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130]\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively.

Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^\nTo address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law\nThe application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an \"armed attack\" under Article 51, justifying self-defense.

For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140]\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges.

South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141]\nEffectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV.

The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151]\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152]\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure\nAerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace\n153) G. A.

However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.\nSouth Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation. This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n THOMAS M.

Conclusion\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nbalancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]",

      "## 2. Liability Considerations Critical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120] The Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace activities, including those by private companies.¹²¹) However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions."

      "## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure Aerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace data, highlighting the inadequacy of existing legal protections.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. has taken steps to address these risks, including the 2011 DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.¹⁵⁶ South Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation.¹⁵⁷ This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity."

Introduction ## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³) As aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴) The integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy reflects a shift to proactive measures, emphasizing resilience, emerging technologies, and industry-government coordination.⁶ This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest ⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Its conclusions align closely with those of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Cyber Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 Convention¹⁰⁾ face significant challenges. Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.¹¹⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.¹²⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.¹³⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.",
    "## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea Cybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.¹⁴⁾ As emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue Issues (UNGGE).": "No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace to develop, new cybersecurity risks are arising. AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^ There is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^ Despite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states. By participating in international Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 initiatives like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and NATO's cybersecurity cooperation, South Korea can contribute to a collective global cybersecurity effort while bolstering its own defense posture.\nInternally, strengthening public-private partnerships (PPPs) is key to enhancing South Korea's cybersecurity. Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^ Furthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^ Therefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.",
    "## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law South Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.": "^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace Cybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.²⁰) South Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.²¹) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)²²) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.²³) While international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 infrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.²⁴) At the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,²⁵) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.²⁶) Although the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.",
    "## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration Cyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.²⁷) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea, a global leader in technology, is developing a dynamic cybersecurity market, particularly in aviation. Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.²⁸) Aviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.²⁹) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.³⁰) International law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).³¹) South Korea follows these standards through its Aviation Act No. 14114 and Aviation Act No. 14551, ensuring compliance with ICAO's cybersecurity protocols while fostering global cooperation.³²) As cyber threats evolve, frameworks like the (Network Security, Endpoint Security), By Deployment Mode (On-Premises, Cloud-Based), By Aviation (Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation), By Threat Type (Malware, Ransomware), By End-User (Airlines, Airports), By Geographic Scope And Forecast, VERIFIED MKT.

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space The rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.³⁹) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.⁴⁰) Satellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,⁴¹) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.⁴²) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.⁴³) In recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 measures among satellite operators.⁴⁴) It called for stakeholder-specific actions, including prioritizing the development of norms and standards in collaboration with like-minded partners.⁴⁵) The changing dynamics of space security and the infusion of geopolitical rivalry further complicate matters, making international cooperation even more crucial.⁴⁶) This includes the need for norms, standards, best practices, and regulations to prevent interference with satellite operations. However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.⁴⁷) International regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,⁴⁸) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.⁴⁹) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space. Several initiatives, including the U.N.'s Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2019),⁵⁰) the EU's 3SOS initiative, and the U.N. Open-ended Working ⁴⁴) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n⁴⁵) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n⁴⁶) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n⁴⁷) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n⁴⁸) G.A.

Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n⁵⁰) The\"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\"were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace Group on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52) As South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical the sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\nJournal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 space infrastructure.⁵⁵) Cooperation between public and private sectors is key, especially as the private sector controls about 80% of the global cyber infrastructure, with commercial space infrastructure growing exponentially. NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.⁵⁶) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.⁵⁷) In conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.",

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63) To address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 robust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks.⁶⁴ Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation⁶⁵ and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems.⁶⁶ Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks.⁶⁷ Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

    "## III. Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity ### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks The inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^ A key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement ^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79) The challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81) Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 A more effective approach would require the development of an enforceable multilateral framework under ICAO and the UN, ensuring that cybersecurity standards are not only established but also consistently implemented. This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^ Ultimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.",
    "## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms South Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^ In cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration foreignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.": "^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace necessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89] To improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 governance. These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.",
    "## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains The lack of standardized definitions for key terms like\"cyber weapon\"and\"space debris\"creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.": "In cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as\"cybercrime\"and\"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on\"cybersecurity\"as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define\"information security\"as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of\"cyber weapon\"further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91) Similarly, in space law, the terms\"space weapon\"and\"space debris\"remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define\"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace pretations.⁹³) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.⁹⁴) These inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.⁹⁵) Current initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.⁹⁶) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret\"non-aggressive\"rather than\"non-military,\"which allows for military uses of outer space.

Dual-Use Technologies in Cyber and Space Domains The regulation of dual-use technologies, such as AI and space systems, presents significant challenges due to their military and civilian applications. Technologies like anti-satellite systems and satellite communication complicate arms control and export restrictions because they cross borders without traceability. Efforts by international organizations like the Wassenaar Arrangement struggle with political divisions, hindering effective global regulation. International agreements remain inconsistent and politically driven, making global governance of these technologies difficult.^[97]^ Countries like South Korea, a leader in digital innovation, face difficulties balancing technological sovereignty with international cooperation. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has been advancing technologies critical for defense and economic growth,^[98]^ including AI, quantum computing, and aerospace innovations.^[99]^ However, the integration of dual-use technologies within the defense sector is complicated by the reliance on chaebols, which are involved in both civilian and military production.^[100]^ This raises concerns about the oversight and regulation of such technologies, with significant inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.

This overlap creates legal challenges and discrepancies in national positions, as countries seek to protect their strategic interests while adhering to international regulations.\nIn conclusion, current aerospace cybersecurity frameworks are insufficient due to legal gaps in applicability, voluntary adoption, and inconsistent enforcement. Key legal issues include unclear definitions, lack of global standards, and discrepancies in domestic and international regulations. Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.",
    "## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges ## 1. Regulatory Frameworks The aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets.": "No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace At the national level, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) faces regulatory gaps in manufacturing standards, particularly in parts production technologies such as surface and heat treatment. The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113] Recognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. \nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118] To address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 strengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.",
    "## 2. Liability Considerations Critical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120] The Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace activities, including those by private companies.¹²¹) However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.": "The issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.¹²³) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.¹²⁴) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries ¹²¹) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n¹²²) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n¹²³) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n¹²⁴) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.",
    "## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges The aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.": "Jurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule.¹²⁵ As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.¹²⁶ Furthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the ¹²⁵) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n¹²⁶) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127] Each nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128] For example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130] Initiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively. The WannaCry (2017) case, which involved Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 North Korean cyber actors, highlights how political conflicts and the lack of diplomatic relations between countries complicate the prosecution of cybercriminals. Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^ To address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.",
    "## 4. Countermeasures in International Law The application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an\"armed attack\"under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^[133]^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^[134]^ ^[131]^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).": "^[132]^ U.N. Charter arts. 39-41. Furthermore, countermeasures must still comply with the prohibition on the use of force under art. 2 para. 4.\n^[133]^ While Chapter VII grants the UN Security Council authority to address threats to international security, its applicability to cyber operations remains ambiguous.\n^[134]^ TALITA DIAS, COUNTERMEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THEIR ROLE IN CYBERSPACE, No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace National cybersecurity policies reveal divergent legal approaches. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140] Despite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global CHATHAM HOUSE (May 2024), https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\nJournal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 systems and exposed the difficulties of enforcing countermeasures when diplomatic options are limited. South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141] Effectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.",
    "## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity ### A. Compliance with International Law The integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142] A closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace cybersecurity needs of UAS. $)}$ Additionally, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime offer some protection against cyber threats like espionage, but they do not address the specific risks posed by UAS, such as hacking of command-and-control systems or data manipulation during flight operations. $)}$ South Korea has made significant progress in integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into its national aviation regulations. However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $)}$ The issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing. While countries like the EU and the U.S. have developed robust cybersecurity frameworks for cross-border collaboration, South Korea's participation in these initiatives has been limited. $)}$ For instance, South Korea has yet to fully engage in cooperative frameworks like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which fosters cross-border data protection and cybersecurity collaboration. This lack of active participation in international cybersecurity efforts may hinder South Korea's ability to effectively address the cyber risks associated with unmanned aircraft in a globally integrated aviation system. $)}$ Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 The situation is further complicated by differing national approaches to cybersecurity. The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.": "Looking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations. To achieve this, the country must adopt a more proactive approach by aligning its national policies with international standards and engaging in multilateral cybersecurity efforts.^[148]^ Initiatives like the EU's Digital Single Market and U. S.-China Cybersecurity Cooperation provide valuable lessons on the benefits of cross-border collaboration.^[149]^ By focusing on cooperation, information-sharing, and policy harmonization, countries can work together to create a more resilient and secure aerospace infrastructure.^[150]^ In conclusion, although South Korea has made notable progress in integrating unmanned aircraft into its aviation frameworks, the country faces significant challenges in aligning its cybersecurity policies with international standards. To enhance its role in the global aerospace ecosystem, South Korea must take a more proactive approach, fostering deeper international collaboration, harmonizing policies, and implementing comprehensive frameworks. These steps will not only improve the country's No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace own cybersecurity posture but also contribute to a safer and more cohesive international aviation system capable of addressing emerging cyber threats.",
    "## B. Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation Cybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.": "A key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151] International cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152] Existing international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 aerospace. However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^ To address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^ While cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.",
    "## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure Aerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace data, highlighting the inadequacy of existing legal protections.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. has taken steps to address these risks, including the 2011 DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.¹⁵⁶ South Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation.¹⁵⁷ This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.": "Despite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n¹⁵⁵ THOMAS M.

Conclusion In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like\"weapon,\"\"drone,\"and\"use of force,\"making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace balancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]"

This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations\nManuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\n# I. Introduction\n## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.)\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.)\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.)\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols. While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare and Budapest\n) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.⁾\nAs emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue\nIssues (UNGGE).\n10) First international treaty aimed at addressing crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, relevant to issues in cybersecurity law.\n11) Arpita Rout, Digital Sovereignty and Cyber Law, LEGAL VIDHIYA (Feb. 11, 2025), https://legalvidhiya.com/digital-sovereignty-and-cyber-law/.\n12) Andrew C.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.)\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.)\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention. To combat unlawful interference in civil aviation, ICAO adopted Annex 17 in March 1974, establishing the first SARPs for aviation security.\n22) The 13th Edition (2022) of Doc 8973 and Annex 17 are regularly updated to address emerging threats and technological advancements impacting aviation security measures.\n23) Hanggongbeob [Aviation Act] art. 38-2 (aligning with Chicago Convention art. 18, a key aviation standard) (S. Kor.).\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\ninfrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.)\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.)\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.)\n24) Id. art. 38-2 (S.

Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.)\nInternational law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).)

Through its active involvement with ICAO and the adoption of frameworks like NIST and EUROCAE, South Korea is positioning itself as an important player in global cybersecurity governance, supported by the Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA).

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nThe rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.)\nSatellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.)\nIn recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity\n39) EUR.

It called for stakeholder-specific actions, including prioritizing the development of norms and standards in collaboration with like-minded partners.) The changing dynamics of space security and the infusion of geopolitical rivalry further complicate matters, making international cooperation even more crucial.) This includes the need for norms, standards, best practices, and regulations to prevent interference with satellite operations. However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.)\nInternational regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space. Several initiatives, including the U.N.'s Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2019),) the EU's 3SOS initiative, and the U.N. Open-ended Working\n) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n) G.A. Res. 2222 (XXI), Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Dec. 19, 1966).\n) The Outer Space Treaty, adopted in 1966 (Res. 2222 (XXI)) and based on the 1963 Declaration of Legal Principles (Res. 1962 (XVIII)), introduced new provisions. Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n) The \"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\" were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nGroup on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52)\nAs South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical\nthe sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n51) In September 2019, the US Air Force alerted the European Space Agency (ESA) about a potential collision between the Aeolus satellite and SpaceX's Starlink44. After Starlink didn't respond, ESA performed its first collision avoidance maneuver. This incident led to the launch of the Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Outer Space (3SOS) initiative by the European External Action Service (EEAS), addressing low Earth orbit congestion and promoting responsible space behavior, traffic management, data sharing, and satellite deorbiting. ESA is also proposing an automated risk estimation system to improve collision avoidance and protect space infrastructure.\n52) Sorin Docaru, Cybersecurity in Outer Space: A Q&amp;A with Ambassador Sorin Docaru, Digit.

NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.)\nIn conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63)\nTo address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack\n58) Rebecca Herold, A Cybersecurity Framework for Mitigating Risks to Satellite Systems (Oct. 25, 2023), DARK READING, https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/cybersecurity-framework-mitigating-risks-satellite-systems/.\n59) Elton Chang, Cybersecurity Regulations for Satellite Networks, TELECOMWORLD101.COM (Mar. 25, 2024), https://telecomworld101.com/cybersecurity-regulations-satellite/.\n60) CSERA, Cybersecurity for Satellite Systems: Securing Space Communications, LINKEDIN (Jan. 1, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-satellite-systems-securing-space-communications-csera-1lo1f/.\n61) Sylvester Kaczmarek, Cybersecurity for Satellites Is a Growing Challenge, as Threats to Space-Based Infrastructure Grow, THE CONVERSATION (Feb. 20, 2024, 6:24 PM), https://theconversation.com/cybersecurity-for-satellites-is-a-growing-challenge-as-threats-to-space-based-infrastructure-grow-223877.\n62) Sven Dharmani, Case Study: How Real-Time Satellite Data Is Keeping Supply Chains Moving, EY, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-to-respond-when-certainty-is-a-missing-link-in-your-supply-chain (last visited Dec. 14, 2024).\n63) Kaczmarek, supra note 61.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nrobust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks. Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems. Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks. Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

These collaborations, including participation in regional initiatives like the Asia-Pacific Cybersecurity Strategy, have enhanced the country's resilience to cyber threats in space operations.) However, domestically, South Korea has faced criticism for its censorship regulations, which some view as trade barriers under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement.) Critics argue that these laws not only undermine the competitiveness of domestic companies but could also inadvertently assist North Korea by revealing sensitive military locations through discrepancies between censored and uncensored satellite images.) This situation raises concerns about the balance between national security and global competitiveness in the space sector.\nAlthough international space law, particularly treaties like the Outer Space Treaty, provided a foundation for space governance, these agreements, created in the 1960s and 1970s, have struggled to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology.) As space systems become more complex and cyber threats continue to rise, there's a clear need for more flexible and responsive regulatory frameworks. The existing treaties were drafted when space technology was far simpler, and they leave important gaps in addressing modern risks, such as cyber-attacks.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms\nSouth Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^\nIn cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration\nforeignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nnecessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89]\nTo improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space\n86) Yim &amp; Park, supra note 78.\n87) Id.\n88) Garrett Shea, Republic of Korea Joins List of Nations to Sign Artemis Accords, NASA (May 26, 2021), https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/republic-of-korea-joins-list-of-nations-to-sign-artemis-accords/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n89) Evan A.

These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define \"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter\n90) Cyber weapons are difficult to define, as their effects vary. APSI notes that cyber technology often has dual purposes—attack/defense, peaceful/aggressive, legal/illegal. The modular nature of cyber tools allows legitimate software to be repurposed for destructive purposes. A narrow definition could be \"software and IT systems that cause destructive effects through ICT networks with no other uses.\"\n91) It can be defined as \"any space-based or terrestrial-based weapon that achieves kinetic or non-kinetic destructive effects in space, conflicts with the peaceful uses of space, and threatens to destabilize space security.\"\n92) In Article 4 of the Treaty, Cervino, Corradini &amp; Davolio (2003), as well as Henry et al.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\npretations.) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.)\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.)\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space. Article 4(2) states: \"The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" However, there is no unanimous interpretation of \"peaceful purposes\" in the international community. Christol (1984), Markoff (1976), and Vlasic (1981) interpret \"peaceful\" strictly, equating it to \"non-military.\"\n) Danylo Stonis, *Ambiguities in Space Law as Path Towards Weaponization of Space: The Case of the Outer Space Treaty.

Technologies like anti-satellite systems and satellite communication complicate arms control and export restrictions because they cross borders without traceability. Efforts by international organizations like the Wassenaar Arrangement struggle with political divisions, hindering effective global regulation. International agreements remain inconsistent and politically driven, making global governance of these technologies difficult.^[97]^\nCountries like South Korea, a leader in digital innovation, face difficulties balancing technological sovereignty with international cooperation.

Despite these efforts, defining terms like “cyber weapons” and “military-use technologies” remains challenging, as commercial technologies can be easily adapted for military purposes, complicating arms control and international agreements.\nInternational legal frameworks like the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) govern the export of dual-use technologies, but they are not universally applied, with gaps in compliance across nations. South Korea’s approach to aerospace cybersecurity is influenced by these international norms, but there are gaps in domestic compliance. For instance, compliance with regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is essential for entities involved in defense technologies, yet countries with different regulatory standards often struggle to reach agreement on their application.\nCollaboration with international partners further complicates legal compliance. For instance, South Korea’s partnerships with Finnish companies in quantum technology involve dealing with complex export control laws.

Key legal issues include unclear definitions, lack of global standards, and discrepancies in domestic and international regulations. Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, $^{110}$ and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges\n## 1. Regulatory Frameworks\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n111) Robert S.

The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113]\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118]\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120]\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space\n119) Space Law Treaties and Principles, U.N. OFF. FOR OUTER SPACE AFFS., https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties.html (last visited Dec. 14, 2024).\n120) Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Nov. 29, 1971, 961 U.N.T.S. 187.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nactivities, including those by private companies.) However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule. As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127]\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128]\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130]\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively.

Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^\nTo address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law\nThe application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an \"armed attack\" under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^[133]^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^[134]^\n^[131]^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).\n^[132]^ U.N.

Furthermore, countermeasures must still comply with the prohibition on the use of force under art. 2 para. 4.\n^[133]^ While Chapter VII grants the UN Security Council authority to address threats to international security, its applicability to cyber operations remains ambiguous.\n^[134]^ TALITA DIAS, COUNTERMEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THEIR ROLE IN CYBERSPACE,\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nNational cybersecurity policies reveal divergent legal approaches. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140]\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global\nCHATHAM HOUSE (May 2024), https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\n135) U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., 2023 CYBER STRATEGY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (2023), https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299076/-1/-1/1/2023_DOD_Cyber_Strategy_Summary.PDF?.\n136) Regulation 2019/881, 2019 O.J.

South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141]\nEffectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Compliance with International Law\nThe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142]\nA closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader\n141) U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., supra note 131.\n142) William M. Pannier et al., Aerospace and Defense Industries, 48 INT'L L. 231 (2015).\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\ncybersecurity needs of UAS. $^{143)}$ Additionally, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime offer some protection against cyber threats like espionage, but they do not address the specific risks posed by UAS, such as hacking of command-and-control systems or data manipulation during flight operations. $^{144)}$\nSouth Korea has made significant progress in integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into its national aviation regulations. However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $^{145)}$\nThe issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing. While countries like the EU and the U.S. have developed robust cybersecurity frameworks for cross-border collaboration, South Korea's participation in these initiatives has been limited. $^{146)}$ For instance, South Korea has yet to fully engage in cooperative frameworks like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which fosters cross-border data protection and cybersecurity collaboration. This lack of active participation in international cybersecurity efforts may hinder South Korea's ability to effectively address the cyber risks associated with unmanned aircraft in a globally integrated aviation system. $^{147)}$\n143) Regulation 2016/679, 2016 O.J.

The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations. To achieve this, the country must adopt a more proactive approach by aligning its national policies with international standards and engaging in multilateral cybersecurity efforts.^[148]^ Initiatives like the EU's Digital Single Market and U. S.-China Cybersecurity Cooperation provide valuable lessons on the benefits of cross-border collaboration.^[149]^ By focusing on cooperation, information-sharing, and policy harmonization, countries can work together to create a more resilient and secure aerospace infrastructure.^[150]^\nIn conclusion, although South Korea has made notable progress in integrating unmanned aircraft into its aviation frameworks, the country faces significant challenges in aligning its cybersecurity policies with international standards. To enhance its role in the global aerospace ecosystem, South Korea must take a more proactive approach, fostering deeper international collaboration, harmonizing policies, and implementing comprehensive frameworks.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151]\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152]\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure\nAerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace\n153) G. A. Res. 53/70 (Dec. 4, 1998).\n154) HITCHENS &amp; GOREN, supra note 152, at 4-7.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\ndata, highlighting the inadequacy of existing legal protections.\nThe U.S. has taken steps to address these risks, including the 2011 DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.\nSouth Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation. This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n THOMAS M.

Conclusion\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nbalancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]",

This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations\nManuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\n# I. Introduction\n## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.)\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.)\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.)\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols. While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare and Budapest\n) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.⁾\nAs emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue\nIssues (UNGGE).\n10) First international treaty aimed at addressing crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, relevant to issues in cybersecurity law.\n11) Arpita Rout, Digital Sovereignty and Cyber Law, LEGAL VIDHIYA (Feb. 11, 2025), https://legalvidhiya.com/digital-sovereignty-and-cyber-law/.\n12) Andrew C.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.)\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.)\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention. To combat unlawful interference in civil aviation, ICAO adopted Annex 17 in March 1974, establishing the first SARPs for aviation security.\n22) The 13th Edition (2022) of Doc 8973 and Annex 17 are regularly updated to address emerging threats and technological advancements impacting aviation security measures.\n23) Hanggongbeob [Aviation Act] art. 38-2 (aligning with Chicago Convention art. 18, a key aviation standard) (S. Kor.).\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\ninfrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.)\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.)\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.)\n24) Id. art. 38-2 (S.

Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.)\nAviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.)\nInternational law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).)

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nThe rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.)\nSatellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.)\nIn recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity\n39) EUR.

It called for stakeholder-specific actions, including prioritizing the development of norms and standards in collaboration with like-minded partners.) The changing dynamics of space security and the infusion of geopolitical rivalry further complicate matters, making international cooperation even more crucial.) This includes the need for norms, standards, best practices, and regulations to prevent interference with satellite operations. However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.)\nInternational regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space. Several initiatives, including the U.N.'s Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2019),) the EU's 3SOS initiative, and the U.N. Open-ended Working\n) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n) G.A. Res. 2222 (XXI), Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Dec. 19, 1966).\n) The Outer Space Treaty, adopted in 1966 (Res. 2222 (XXI)) and based on the 1963 Declaration of Legal Principles (Res. 1962 (XVIII)), introduced new provisions. Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n) The \"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\" were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nGroup on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52)\nAs South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical\nthe sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n51) In September 2019, the US Air Force alerted the European Space Agency (ESA) about a potential collision between the Aeolus satellite and SpaceX's Starlink44. After Starlink didn't respond, ESA performed its first collision avoidance maneuver. This incident led to the launch of the Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Outer Space (3SOS) initiative by the European External Action Service (EEAS), addressing low Earth orbit congestion and promoting responsible space behavior, traffic management, data sharing, and satellite deorbiting. ESA is also proposing an automated risk estimation system to improve collision avoidance and protect space infrastructure.\n52) Sorin Docaru, Cybersecurity in Outer Space: A Q&amp;A with Ambassador Sorin Docaru, Digit.

NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.)\nIn conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63)\nTo address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats.

These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems. Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks. Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms\nSouth Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^\nIn cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration\nforeignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nnecessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89]\nTo improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space\n86) Yim &amp; Park, supra note 78.\n87) Id.\n88) Garrett Shea, Republic of Korea Joins List of Nations to Sign Artemis Accords, NASA (May 26, 2021), https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/republic-of-korea-joins-list-of-nations-to-sign-artemis-accords/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n89) Evan A.

These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define \"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter\n90) Cyber weapons are difficult to define, as their effects vary. APSI notes that cyber technology often has dual purposes—attack/defense, peaceful/aggressive, legal/illegal. The modular nature of cyber tools allows legitimate software to be repurposed for destructive purposes. A narrow definition could be \"software and IT systems that cause destructive effects through ICT networks with no other uses.\"\n91) It can be defined as \"any space-based or terrestrial-based weapon that achieves kinetic or non-kinetic destructive effects in space, conflicts with the peaceful uses of space, and threatens to destabilize space security.\"\n92) In Article 4 of the Treaty, Cervino, Corradini &amp; Davolio (2003), as well as Henry et al.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\npretations.) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.)\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.)\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space. Article 4(2) states: \"The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" However, there is no unanimous interpretation of \"peaceful purposes\" in the international community. Christol (1984), Markoff (1976), and Vlasic (1981) interpret \"peaceful\" strictly, equating it to \"non-military.\"\n) Danylo Stonis, *Ambiguities in Space Law as Path Towards Weaponization of Space: The Case of the Outer Space Treaty.

Despite these efforts, defining terms like “cyber weapons” and “military-use technologies” remains challenging, as commercial technologies can be easily adapted for military purposes, complicating arms control and international agreements.\nInternational legal frameworks like the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) govern the export of dual-use technologies, but they are not universally applied, with gaps in compliance across nations. South Korea’s approach to aerospace cybersecurity is influenced by these international norms, but there are gaps in domestic compliance. For instance, compliance with regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is essential for entities involved in defense technologies, yet countries with different regulatory standards often struggle to reach agreement on their application.\nCollaboration with international partners further complicates legal compliance. For instance, South Korea’s partnerships with Finnish companies in quantum technology involve dealing with complex export control laws.

Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, $^{110}$ and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges\n## 1. Regulatory Frameworks\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n111) Robert S.

The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113]\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118]\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120]\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space\n119) Space Law Treaties and Principles, U.N. OFF.

However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule. As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127]\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128]\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130]\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively.

Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^\nTo address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law\nThe application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an \"armed attack\" under Article 51, justifying self-defense.

For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140]\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global\nCHATHAM HOUSE (May 2024), https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\n135) U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., 2023 CYBER STRATEGY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (2023), https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299076/-1/-1/1/2023_DOD_Cyber_Strategy_Summary.PDF?.\n136) Regulation 2019/881, 2019 O.J.

South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141]\nEffectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Compliance with International Law\nThe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142]\nA closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader\n141) U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., supra note 131.\n142) William M.

However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $^{145)}$\nThe issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing.

The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151]\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152]\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure\nAerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace\n153) G. A.

However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.\nSouth Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation. This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n THOMAS M.

Conclusion\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nbalancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]"

This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations\nManuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\n# I. Introduction\n## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³)\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴)\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵)\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest\n⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.¹¹⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.¹²⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.¹³⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.¹⁴⁾\nAs emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue\nIssues (UNGGE).\n10) First international treaty aimed at addressing crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, relevant to issues in cybersecurity law.\n11) Arpita Rout, Digital Sovereignty and Cyber Law, LEGAL VIDHIYA (Feb. 11, 2025), https://legalvidhiya.com/digital-sovereignty-and-cyber-law/.\n12) Andrew C.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^^\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^^\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^^\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^^\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.²⁰)\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.²¹) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)²²) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.²³)\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention. To combat unlawful interference in civil aviation, ICAO adopted Annex 17 in March 1974, establishing the first SARPs for aviation security.\n22) The 13th Edition (2022) of Doc 8973 and Annex 17 are regularly updated to address emerging threats and technological advancements impacting aviation security measures.\n23) Hanggongbeob [Aviation Act] art. 38-2 (aligning with Chicago Convention art. 18, a key aviation standard) (S. Kor.).\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\ninfrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.²⁴)\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,²⁵) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.²⁶)\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.²⁷)\n24) Id. art. 38-2 (S.

Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.²⁸)\nAviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.²⁹) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.³⁰)\nInternational law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).³¹) South Korea follows these standards through its Aviation Act No. 14114 and Aviation Act No. 14551, ensuring compliance with ICAO's cybersecurity protocols while fostering global cooperation.³²) As cyber threats evolve, frameworks like the\n(Network Security, Endpoint Security), By Deployment Mode (On-Premises, Cloud-Based), By Aviation (Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation), By Threat Type (Malware, Ransomware), By End-User (Airlines, Airports), By Geographic Scope And Forecast, VERIFIED MKT.

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space\nThe rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.³⁹) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.⁴⁰)\nSatellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,⁴¹) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.⁴²) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.⁴³)\nIn recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity\n39) EUR.

However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.⁴⁷)\nInternational regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,⁴⁸) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.⁴⁹) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space.

Open-ended Working\n⁴⁴) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n⁴⁵) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n⁴⁶) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n⁴⁷) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n⁴⁸) G.A.

Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n⁵⁰) The \"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\" were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nGroup on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52)\nAs South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical\nthe sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n51) In September 2019, the US Air Force alerted the European Space Agency (ESA) about a potential collision between the Aeolus satellite and SpaceX's Starlink44. After Starlink didn't respond, ESA performed its first collision avoidance maneuver. This incident led to the launch of the Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Outer Space (3SOS) initiative by the European External Action Service (EEAS), addressing low Earth orbit congestion and promoting responsible space behavior, traffic management, data sharing, and satellite deorbiting. ESA is also proposing an automated risk estimation system to improve collision avoidance and protect space infrastructure.\n52) Sorin Docaru, Cybersecurity in Outer Space: A Q&amp;A with Ambassador Sorin Docaru, Digit.

NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.⁵⁶) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.⁵⁷)\nIn conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63)\nTo address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack\n58) Rebecca Herold, A Cybersecurity Framework for Mitigating Risks to Satellite Systems (Oct. 25, 2023), DARK READING, https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/cybersecurity-framework-mitigating-risks-satellite-systems/.\n59) Elton Chang, Cybersecurity Regulations for Satellite Networks, TELECOMWORLD101.COM (Mar. 25, 2024), https://telecomworld101.com/cybersecurity-regulations-satellite/.\n60) CSERA, Cybersecurity for Satellite Systems: Securing Space Communications, LINKEDIN (Jan. 1, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-satellite-systems-securing-space-communications-csera-1lo1f/.\n61) Sylvester Kaczmarek, Cybersecurity for Satellites Is a Growing Challenge, as Threats to Space-Based Infrastructure Grow, THE CONVERSATION (Feb. 20, 2024, 6:24 PM), https://theconversation.com/cybersecurity-for-satellites-is-a-growing-challenge-as-threats-to-space-based-infrastructure-grow-223877.\n62) Sven Dharmani, Case Study: How Real-Time Satellite Data Is Keeping Supply Chains Moving, EY, https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-to-respond-when-certainty-is-a-missing-link-in-your-supply-chain (last visited Dec. 14, 2024).\n63) Kaczmarek, supra note 61.\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nrobust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks.⁶⁴ Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation⁶⁵ and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems.⁶⁶ Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks.⁶⁷ Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework.

These collaborations, including participation in regional initiatives like the Asia-Pacific Cybersecurity Strategy, have enhanced the country's resilience to cyber threats in space operations.⁶⁹) However, domestically, South Korea has faced criticism for its censorship regulations, which some view as trade barriers under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement.⁷⁰) Critics argue that these laws not only undermine the competitiveness of domestic companies but could also inadvertently assist North Korea by revealing sensitive military locations through discrepancies between censored and uncensored satellite images.⁷¹) This situation raises concerns about the balance between national security and global competitiveness in the space sector.\nAlthough international space law, particularly treaties like the Outer Space Treaty, provided a foundation for space governance, these agreements, created in the 1960s and 1970s, have struggled to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology.⁷²) As space systems become more complex and cyber threats continue to rise, there's a clear need for more flexible and responsive regulatory frameworks.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^^\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n^^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

Similarly, UN initiatives on cybersecurity, including efforts by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aim to establish global norms, but their effectiveness is hindered by varying national interests and regulatory frameworks.77)\nSouth Korea has taken proactive steps to enhance cybersecurity cooperation, particularly through agreements with the United States and Japan to counter cyber threats from North Korea.78) However, these efforts highlight the broader issue: while bilateral and regional agreements may strengthen cybersecurity in specific areas, they do not provide a comprehensive global solution. The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^^\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms\nSouth Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^^\nIn cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration\nforeignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nnecessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration. South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation. South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives. Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.\nTo improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space\n86) Yim &amp; Park, supra note 78.\n87) Id.\n88) Garrett Shea, Republic of Korea Joins List of Nations to Sign Artemis Accords, NASA (May 26, 2021), https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/republic-of-korea-joins-list-of-nations-to-sign-artemis-accords/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n89) Evan A.

These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define \"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter\n90) Cyber weapons are difficult to define, as their effects vary. APSI notes that cyber technology often has dual purposes—attack/defense, peaceful/aggressive, legal/illegal. The modular nature of cyber tools allows legitimate software to be repurposed for destructive purposes. A narrow definition could be \"software and IT systems that cause destructive effects through ICT networks with no other uses.\"\n91) It can be defined as \"any space-based or terrestrial-based weapon that achieves kinetic or non-kinetic destructive effects in space, conflicts with the peaceful uses of space, and threatens to destabilize space security.\"\n92) In Article 4 of the Treaty, Cervino, Corradini &amp; Davolio (2003), as well as Henry et al.\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\npretations.⁹³) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.⁹⁴)\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.⁹⁵)\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.⁹⁶) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space. Article 4(2) states: \"The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" However, there is no unanimous interpretation of \"peaceful purposes\" in the international community.

Key legal issues include unclear definitions, lack of global standards, and discrepancies in domestic and international regulations. Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, $^{110}$ and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges\n## 1. Regulatory Frameworks\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n111) Robert S.

The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to\nJournal of Korean Law\nVol. 24: 83\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated. For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space\n119) Space Law Treaties and Principles, U.N. OFF.

This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.¹²³) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.¹²⁴) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n¹²¹) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n¹²²) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n¹²³) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n¹²⁴) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule.¹²⁵ As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.¹²⁶\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n¹²⁵) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n¹²⁶) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives. This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively.

Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^^\nTo address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law\nThe application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an \"armed attack\" under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^^\n^^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).\n^^ U.N.

Furthermore, countermeasures must still comply with the prohibition on the use of force under art. 2 para. 4.\n^^ While Chapter VII grants the UN Security Council authority to address threats to international security, its applicability to cyber operations remains ambiguous.\n^^ TALITA DIAS, COUNTERMEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THEIR ROLE IN CYBERSPACE,\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nNational cybersecurity policies reveal divergent legal approaches. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence. In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures. Meanwhile, China and Russia, both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus. The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global\nCHATHAM HOUSE (May 2024), https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\n135) U.S. DEP'T OF DEF., 2023 CYBER STRATEGY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (2023), https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299076/-1/-1/1/2023_DOD_Cyber_Strategy_Summary.PDF?.\n136) Regulation 2019/881, 2019 O.J.

South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.\nEffectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity\n### A. Compliance with International Law\nThe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.\nA closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader\n141) U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., supra note 131.\n142) William M.

However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $^{145)}$\nThe issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing. While countries like the EU and the U.S. have developed robust cybersecurity frameworks for cross-border collaboration, South Korea's participation in these initiatives has been limited. $^{146)}$ For instance, South Korea has yet to fully engage in cooperative frameworks like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which fosters cross-border data protection and cybersecurity collaboration. This lack of active participation in international cybersecurity efforts may hinder South Korea's ability to effectively address the cyber risks associated with unmanned aircraft in a globally integrated aviation system. $^{147)}$\n143) Regulation 2016/679, 2016 O.J.

The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations. To achieve this, the country must adopt a more proactive approach by aligning its national policies with international standards and engaging in multilateral cybersecurity efforts.^^ Initiatives like the EU's Digital Single Market and U. S.-China Cybersecurity Cooperation provide valuable lessons on the benefits of cross-border collaboration.^^ By focusing on cooperation, information-sharing, and policy harmonization, countries can work together to create a more resilient and secure aerospace infrastructure.^^\nIn conclusion, although South Korea has made notable progress in integrating unmanned aircraft into its aviation frameworks, the country faces significant challenges in aligning its cybersecurity policies with international standards. To enhance its role in the global aerospace ecosystem, South Korea must take a more proactive approach, fostering deeper international collaboration, harmonizing policies, and implementing comprehensive frameworks.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^^\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^^\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure\nAerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace\n153) G. A.

However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.¹⁵⁶\nSouth Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation.¹⁵⁷ This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n¹⁵⁵ THOMAS M.

Conclusion\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on\nNo. 1: 2025\nCyber-security in Aerospace\nbalancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]"

This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations Manuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.\nJournal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 # I. Introduction ## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³) As aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴) The integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy reflects a shift to proactive measures, emphasizing resilience, emerging technologies, and industry-government coordination.⁶ This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest ⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR. FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INT'L STUD. (Aug. 2, 2024), https://www.csis.org/blogs/strategic-technologies-blog/south-koreas-2024-cyber-strategy-primer.\n⁷) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA CYBERSECURITY (2023).\n⁸) Ciberseguridad en el sector Aeroespacial: escenario, riesgos y retos de futuro [Cybersecurity in the Aerospace Sector: Scenario, Risk and Future Challenges], SAFE CORE, https://safecore.io/es/industrias/ciberseguridad-en-el-sector-aeroespacial-el-escenario-futuros-riesgos-y-retos/ (last visited Dec. 14, 2024) (In Spanish).\n⁹) The Tallinn Manual clarifies the application of international legal norms to cyberspace and assesses the relevance of jus ad bellum and jus in bello in cyberwarfare. Though it lacks official status, its findings are widely accepted by countries and international law experts. Its conclusions align closely with those of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Cyber Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 Convention¹⁰⁾ face significant challenges. Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.¹¹⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.¹²⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.¹³⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea Cybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. This exposed the need for more permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes.¹⁴⁾ As emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing continue Issues (UNGGE).\n\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace to develop, new cybersecurity risks are arising. AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^ There is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^ Despite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU. The U.S. National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes critical infrastructure protection through public-private partnerships, while the EU's Cybersecurity Act enforces binding security standards among member states. By participating in international Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 initiatives like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and NATO's cybersecurity cooperation, South Korea can contribute to a collective global cybersecurity effort while bolstering its own defense posture.\nInternally, strengthening public-private partnerships (PPPs) is key to enhancing South Korea's cybersecurity. Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^ Furthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^ Therefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law South Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act. Digital transformation has significantly improved aircraft design, operations, and customer experience but has also introduced escalating cybersecurity risks.\n^[18]^ How to Improve Aerospace and Defense Cyber Security, CREATIVE TECH. &amp; DESIGN (Nov. 3, 2023), https://www.ctnd.com/how-to-improve-aerospace-and-defense-cyber-security/.\n^[19]^ Brian Tae-Hyun Chung et al., *Cybersecurity 2023*, 2023 CHAMBERS GLOBAL PRACTICE GUIDES 1, 10 (2024), https://chambers.com/downloads/gpg/771/011_south_korea.pdf.\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace Cybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.²⁰) South Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.²¹) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual ²²) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.²³) While international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 infrastructure protection, and aviation data security. The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.²⁴) At the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,²⁵) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.²⁶) Although the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration Cyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.²⁷) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea, a global leader in technology, is developing a dynamic cybersecurity market, particularly in aviation. Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.²⁸) Aviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.²⁹) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.³⁰) International law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).³¹) South Korea follows these standards through its Aviation Act No. 14114 and Aviation Act No. 14551, ensuring compliance with ICAO's cybersecurity protocols while fostering global cooperation.³²) As cyber threats evolve, frameworks like the (Network Security, Endpoint Security), By Deployment Mode (On-Premises, Cloud-Based), By Aviation (Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation), By Threat Type (Malware, Ransomware), By End-User (Airlines, Airports), By Geographic Scope And Forecast, VERIFIED MKT.

Legal Perspectives on Cybersecurity in Outer Space The rising reliance on space assets by various sectors introduces significant cybersecurity threats to both space infrastructure and its supporting systems on Earth. While space engineering has traditionally prioritized safety and reliability, cybersecurity now adds a new layer of challenges, such as intentional, man-made threats, alongside natural disasters, technical failures, and human error.³⁹) This is at the heart of the “space cyber nexus,” a rapidly evolving field that presents numerous challenges and is being explored from multiple perspectives. This essay series delves into three main themes: space security and risk, international governance challenges, and global perspectives on inclusivity.⁴⁰) Satellites, originally confined to space, are now integral to cyberspace, facilitating global communication and information exchange. The proliferation of satellite constellations increases risks such as collisions, orbital debris,⁴¹) and cyber intrusions, which could disable both military and nongovernmental satellites. These cybersecurity challenges jeopardize the operation of critical functions like communication, navigation, and control.⁴²) Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach, incorporating cybersecurity measures, supply chain resilience, and international cooperation to ensure the sustainable and secure use of space for future generations.⁴³) In recent years, several significant cybersecurity policy initiatives have emerged, particularly concerning outer space. In April 2023, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report advocated for designating outer space as the 17th critical infrastructure sector, urging enhanced cybersecurity Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 measures among satellite operators.⁴⁴) It called for stakeholder-specific actions, including prioritizing the development of norms and standards in collaboration with like-minded partners.⁴⁵) The changing dynamics of space security and the infusion of geopolitical rivalry further complicate matters, making international cooperation even more crucial.⁴⁶) This includes the need for norms, standards, best practices, and regulations to prevent interference with satellite operations. However, global consensus remains elusive, especially with the rapid evolution of technology.⁴⁷) International regulation of space activities is still in the early stages. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty regulates space as a common domain,⁴⁸) advocating for peaceful use and prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space.⁴⁹) However, there is no dedicated international treaty for cybersecurity in outer space. Several initiatives, including the U.N.'s Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (2019),⁵⁰) the EU's 3SOS initiative, and the U.N. Open-ended Working ⁴⁴) In the three years since the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's 2020 report, both the executive and legislative branches have made significant efforts to improve national cybersecurity. Lawmakers have increased funding for cybersecurity programs, including the establishment of the new State Department Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy and additional support for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n⁴⁵) Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, *Enhancing Cybersecurity in Outer Space*, THE DIPlomat (Apr. 15, 2024), https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/enhancing-cybersecurity-in-outer-space/.\n⁴⁶) Jiwon Ma &amp; Mark Montgomery, *2023 Annual Report on Implementation*, CSC 2.0 (Sept. 19, 2023), https://cybersolarium.org/annual-assessment/2023-annual-report-on-implementation/.\n⁴⁷) Rajagopalan, supra note 45.\n⁴⁸) G.A. Res. 2222 (XXI), Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Dec. 19, 1966).\n⁴⁹) The Outer Space Treaty, adopted in 1966 (Res. 2222 (XXI)) and based on the 1963 Declaration of Legal Principles (Res. 1962 (XVIII)), introduced new provisions. Signed in January 1967 by the Russian Federation, the UK, and the US, it entered into force in October 1967. The Treaty establishes key principles of international space law, including space for the benefit of all, freedom of exploration, the prohibition of national appropriation, and the ban on weapons of mass destruction. It also emphasizes peaceful use of celestial bodies, astronauts as envoys of mankind, national responsibility, liability for space damages, and preventing harmful contamination.\n⁵⁰) The\"Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\"were developed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) during its session in Vienna from June 20-29, 2018. These guidelines serve as a framework to promote No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace Group on cybersecurity, address the need for responsible behavior and transparency in space activities.51) Despite these efforts, more focus is needed on the specific challenges cyberattacks pose to space assets.52) As South Korea becomes more important in space, it has recognized the need to focus on cybersecurity in its space plans. The government has started programs, like creating the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, to improve its space technology and cybersecurity skills.53) This is also shown through its involvement in international discussions on space cybersecurity, working with countries like the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA).54) South Korea's national legal framework is increasingly aligned with international standards to protect its space assets, such as satellites and ground stations, from cyber threats. The Korean Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA) also participates in the development of international cybersecurity standards, reflecting the nation's broader commitment to international law in both aviation and space sectors. South Korea's space program, which relies heavily on secure satellite operations, is directly influenced by international legal norms. In the face of emerging cybersecurity threats, South Korea is enhancing its legal frameworks to protect critical the sustainable use of outer space and address the challenges posed by increasing space activities.\n\nJournal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 space infrastructure.⁵⁵) Cooperation between public and private sectors is key, especially as the private sector controls about 80% of the global cyber infrastructure, with commercial space infrastructure growing exponentially. NATO and the EU have developed significant cooperative efforts to increase resilience against cyberattacks.⁵⁶) These include partnerships with countries like Ukraine and operational centers like NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. South Korea's integration into these global partnerships strengthens its position to influence international legal frameworks for cybersecurity in space.⁵⁷) In conclusion, addressing the cybersecurity challenges in outer space requires a comprehensive approach that combines international law, national regulations, and public-private cooperation. South Korea, through its involvement in international initiatives like the Artemis Accords and its alignment with global standards, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of space security. However, to address the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous international collaboration and the development of new legal norms are essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and security of space activities.\n## C.

This event highlighted the need to secure not only satellites but also the entire supply chain. As these supply chains grow more global and interconnected, the risk of cyber threats during production and distribution continues to rise.62) To address these risks, tools like Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Suricata are used to monitor satellite traffic and detect vulnerabilities. However, these tools are more reactive than proactive, focusing on identifying existing threats rather than preventing new ones. As a result, current cybersecurity measures are insufficient to keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber-attacks on satellite systems.63) To address these risks, international frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for space and the SPARTA matrix offer guidelines to mitigate cyber threats. However, these initiatives are voluntary and lack Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 robust enforcement mechanisms, meaning they do not provide a unified defense against cyber-attacks.⁶⁴ Similarly, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) promotes cooperation⁶⁵ and provides non-binding guidelines on satellite sustainability and space debris mitigation however these efforts do not sufficiently address cybersecurity concerns.\nWhile the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement serve as the foundation of space law, they fall short in addressing the modern cybersecurity challenges that have emerged with advancements in space technology. These treaties were created when space systems were much simpler, which makes them ill-suited to manage the complexities of today's space operations. For example, the 1972 Liability Convention focuses on addressing damages caused by space activities but does not account for the risks posed by cyber-attacks, such as the potential disruption or manipulation of satellite systems.⁶⁶ Similarly, the 1976 Registration Convention requires nations to register space objects, but this alone does not ensure the security or accountability needed in the event of a cyber incident. Although these treaties establish important principles, they do not fully address the rapid technological changes and the evolving cybersecurity threats in space, highlighting the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks.⁶⁷ Moreover, the Moon Agreement of 1979, which builds on the principles of the Outer Space Treaty and focuses on lunar exploration, has yet to gain widespread ratification and lacks support from major spacefaring nations, further highlighting the inadequacies in the current regulatory framework. This underscores the pressing need for updated, more comprehensive legal frameworks to address the emerging cyber- ⁶⁴) Robert Lemos, *Space Race: Defenses Emerge as Satellite-Focused Cyberattacks Ramp Up*, DARK READING (Jan. 6, 2023), https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/space-race-defenses-satellite-cyberattacks.\n⁶⁵) Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, U.N.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity ### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks The inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^ A key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement ^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79) The challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81) Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 A more effective approach would require the development of an enforceable multilateral framework under ICAO and the UN, ensuring that cybersecurity standards are not only established but also consistently implemented. This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^ Ultimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation. Without a unified and enforceable regulatory framework, the vulnerabilities in aerospace cybersecurity will persist, posing significant risks to both national security and international aviation stability.\n## B. Inadequacy of National Policy Documents in the Cyber and Space Realms South Korea's cybersecurity and space policies, despite significant advancements,^[83]^ still exhibit gaps when compared to international standards, undermining the country's ability to fully engage in global governance. This lack of alignment introduces uncertainty and limits international cooperation.^[84]^ In cybersecurity, South Korea has introduced frameworks like the National Cybersecurity Strategy and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).^[85]^ However, these laws lack the depth and global integration foreignaffairs.com/articles/1986-06-01/terrorism-and-law.\n^[82]^ The Claroty Team, *Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age*, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n^[83]^ Jeff Foust, *United States and South Korea Agree to Enhance Space Cooperation*, SPACE NEWS (Apr. 26, 2023), https://spacenews.com/united-states-and-south-korea-agree-to-enhance-space-cooperation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com.\n^[84]^ Yim &amp; Park, *supra* note 78.\n^[85]^ *A Comprehensive Guide to South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)*, PRIVACYENGINE (Nov. 28, 2024), https://www.privacyengine.io/blog/south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act.\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace necessary for meaningful international cooperation. While the EU's GDPR provides a robust framework for cross-border data protection, South Korea's privacy laws remain less harmonized with global standards, limiting its ability to participate in international data-sharing agreements. Countries like the U.S. have established comprehensive frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST standards, which align with global norms, enhancing international collaboration.[86] South Korea's fragmented approach contrasts with these efforts, underscoring the need for legal refinements to improve global cybersecurity trust.\nIn space governance, South Korea falls behind countries like the U.S. and China, who have formalized space policies that align with international treaties. The U.S. integrates national security with space exploration through agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense, while China's space strategy promotes both self-sufficiency and international cooperation.[87] South Korea's National Space Policy, although ambitious, lacks the strategic coherence needed to engage in global space initiatives.[88] Formalizing this policy to align with international frameworks, like the Outer Space Treaty and Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, would position South Korea as a more reliable partner in multilateral space governance.[89] To improve its global standing, South Korea must refine its cybersecurity and space policies. Aligning the Cybersecurity Law with international frameworks like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and OECD guidelines would promote greater interoperability. In the space sector, formalizing a strategy in line with global agreements would foster international cooperation and enhance South Korea's role in global space Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 governance. These legal adjustments would not only reduce uncertainties but also ensure South Korea is positioned as a trustworthy partner in the evolving digital and space landscapes.\n## C. Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains The lack of standardized definitions for key terms like\"cyber weapon\"and\"space debris\"creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as\"cybercrime\"and\"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on\"cybersecurity\"as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define\"information security\"as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of\"cyber weapon\"further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91) Similarly, in space law, the terms\"space weapon\"and\"space debris\"remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles, it does not clearly define\"peaceful use,\"92) allowing military activities in space under differing inter No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace pretations.⁹³) The 2008 PPWT, proposed by China and Russia, faces criticism for excluding ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and the issue of space debris remains unresolved, as the lack of a universally accepted definition hinders binding obligations for debris mitigation. Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.⁹⁴) These inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.⁹⁵) Current initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.⁹⁶) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n(2008), interpret\"non-aggressive\"rather than\"non-military,\"which allows for military uses of outer space.

Dual-Use Technologies in Cyber and Space Domains The regulation of dual-use technologies, such as AI and space systems, presents significant challenges due to their military and civilian applications. Technologies like anti-satellite systems and satellite communication complicate arms control and export restrictions because they cross borders without traceability. Efforts by international organizations like the Wassenaar Arrangement struggle with political divisions, hindering effective global regulation. International agreements remain inconsistent and politically driven, making global governance of these technologies difficult.^[97]^ Countries like South Korea, a leader in digital innovation, face difficulties balancing technological sovereignty with international cooperation. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has been advancing technologies critical for defense and economic growth,^[98]^ including AI, quantum computing, and aerospace innovations.^[99]^ However, the integration of dual-use technologies within the defense sector is complicated by the reliance on chaebols, which are involved in both civilian and military production.^[100]^ This raises concerns about the oversight and regulation of such technologies, with significant inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.

For instance, compliance with regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is essential for entities involved in defense technologies, yet countries with different regulatory standards often struggle to reach agreement on their application.¹⁰⁷ Collaboration with international partners further complicates legal compliance. For instance, South Korea’s partnerships with Finnish companies in quantum technology involve dealing with complex export control laws.¹⁰⁸ Additionally, dual-use technologies, such as rocket technology for anti-satellite weapons and satellite launches, blur the line between military and civilian applications, raising concerns about arms races and international ¹⁰² MSIT, supra note 99.\n¹⁰³ MSIT, KRW 18.6 TRILLION BUDGET APPROVED FOR MSIT IN 2024 (2023).\n¹⁰⁴ The Export Administration Regulations (EAR), managed by the Commerce Department, limit the export of “controlled” items.

This overlap creates legal challenges and discrepancies in national positions, as countries seek to protect their strategic interests while adhering to international regulations.\nIn conclusion, current aerospace cybersecurity frameworks are insufficient due to legal gaps in applicability, voluntary adoption, and inconsistent enforcement. Key legal issues include unclear definitions, lack of global standards, and discrepancies in domestic and international regulations. Strengthening global cooperation, ensuring compliance with international standards, and providing clearer legal definitions are crucial to securing aerospace systems and addressing emerging risks. While initiatives are underway, the inconsistency in legal approaches underscores the need for clearer frameworks and a stronger international consensus.\n## E. Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges ## 1. Regulatory Frameworks The aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. \n\nNo. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace At the national level, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) faces regulatory gaps in manufacturing standards, particularly in parts production technologies such as surface and heat treatment. The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113] Recognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. \nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118] To address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 strengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n## 2. Liability Considerations Critical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120] The Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace activities, including those by private companies.¹²¹) However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.¹²³) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.¹²⁴) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries ¹²¹) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n¹²²) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n¹²³) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n¹²⁴) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges The aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule.¹²⁵ As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.¹²⁶ Furthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the ¹²⁵) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n¹²⁶) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127] Each nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128] For example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130] Initiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms. In the case of bilateral agreements, such as the aforementioned CISA-NIS Memorandum, while useful for improving technical cooperation and information sharing, they do not address the harmonization of laws comprehensively. The WannaCry (2017) case, which involved Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 North Korean cyber actors, highlights how political conflicts and the lack of diplomatic relations between countries complicate the prosecution of cybercriminals. Legal and jurisdictional restrictions between nations like the U.S., South Korea, and other affected countries were hindered by the absence of global legal cooperation.^[131]^ To address jurisdictional challenges in aerospace, it is imperative to establish an international legal framework that harmonizes data protection regulations, jurisdiction over cybercrimes, and cooperation in transnational investigations. The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial. This body could facilitate the resolution of jurisdictional disputes and coordinate research and prosecution efforts, regardless of the divergence of national interests.\n## 4. Countermeasures in International Law The application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an\"armed attack\"under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^[133]^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^[134]^ ^[131]^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).\n^[132]^ U.N.

Furthermore, countermeasures must still comply with the prohibition on the use of force under art. 2 para. 4.\n^[133]^ While Chapter VII grants the UN Security Council authority to address threats to international security, its applicability to cyber operations remains ambiguous.\n^[134]^ TALITA DIAS, COUNTERMEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THEIR ROLE IN CYBERSPACE, No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace National cybersecurity policies reveal divergent legal approaches. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140] Despite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges. For instance, the 2017 WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korean hackers, disrupted global CHATHAM HOUSE, https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024-05-23-countermeasures-international-law-cyberspace-dias.pdf.\n\nJournal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 systems and exposed the difficulties of enforcing countermeasures when diplomatic options are limited. South Korea's cybersecurity strategy strives to balance national sovereignty with international obligations, but the lack of a clear legal framework restricts the effectiveness of potential responses.[141] Effectively addressing these challenges requires greater international coordination and cooperation. While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity ### A. Compliance with International Law The integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142] A closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS. While regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States impose strict requirements on aerospace companies to protect personal data, these frameworks primarily focus on data protection and do not cover the broader No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace cybersecurity needs of UAS. $)}$ Additionally, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime offer some protection against cyber threats like espionage, but they do not address the specific risks posed by UAS, such as hacking of command-and-control systems or data manipulation during flight operations. $)}$ South Korea has made significant progress in integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into its national aviation regulations. However, its cybersecurity policies remain reactive rather than proactive. Unlike the European Union and the United States, which have already implemented comprehensive frameworks to address cybersecurity, including specific provisions for UAS security, South Korea has yet to fully incorporate these concerns into its national policies. While the country adheres to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, it lacks clear regulations to address the digital vulnerabilities unique to unmanned systems. This gap leaves its aerospace sector vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise national security. $)}$ The issue of international cooperation on cybersecurity for unmanned aviation is equally pressing. While countries like the EU and the U.S. have developed robust cybersecurity frameworks for cross-border collaboration, South Korea's participation in these initiatives has been limited. $)}$ For instance, South Korea has yet to fully engage in cooperative frameworks like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which fosters cross-border data protection and cybersecurity collaboration. This lack of active participation in international cybersecurity efforts may hinder South Korea's ability to effectively address the cyber risks associated with unmanned aircraft in a globally integrated aviation system. $)}$ Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 The situation is further complicated by differing national approaches to cybersecurity. The U.S. has a well-established legal framework that not only addresses data protection but also focuses on maintaining system integrity and safeguarding national security. The EU has integrated cybersecurity within broader aviation safety regulations, ensuring that both aspects are considered together. In contrast, South Korea lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law specifically addressing unmanned aviation systems, which creates operational risks and complicates international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, strengthening international cybersecurity frameworks is crucial. South Korea, with its advanced technological capabilities and strategic position in the global aerospace industry, could play an important role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations. To achieve this, the country must adopt a more proactive approach by aligning its national policies with international standards and engaging in multilateral cybersecurity efforts.^[148]^ Initiatives like the EU's Digital Single Market and U. S.-China Cybersecurity Cooperation provide valuable lessons on the benefits of cross-border collaboration.^[149]^ By focusing on cooperation, information-sharing, and policy harmonization, countries can work together to create a more resilient and secure aerospace infrastructure.^[150]^ In conclusion, although South Korea has made notable progress in integrating unmanned aircraft into its aviation frameworks, the country faces significant challenges in aligning its cybersecurity policies with international standards. To enhance its role in the global aerospace ecosystem, South Korea must take a more proactive approach, fostering deeper international collaboration, harmonizing policies, and implementing comprehensive frameworks. These steps will not only improve the country's No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace own cybersecurity posture but also contribute to a safer and more cohesive international aviation system capable of addressing emerging cyber threats.\n## B. Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation Cybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151] International cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152] Existing international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in Journal of Korean Law Vol. 24: 83 aerospace. However, most were established before modern cyber threats emerged, leaving regulatory gaps. Furthermore, global cybersecurity resolutions introduced at the UN General Assembly since 1998 emphasize cooperation but struggle to achieve consensus due to competing geopolitical and economic interests. Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^ To address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^ While cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance. Strengthening aerospace cybersecurity thus requires not only improving legal frameworks but also confronting the deeper challenge of national resistance to binding international commitments. Without clear incentives and enforceable mechanisms, global initiatives will remain fragmented and insufficient to counter evolving cyber threats.\n## C. Safeguarding Critical Aerospace Infrastructure Aerospace cybersecurity is an area of growing importance due to the rapid adoption of new digital technologies. The intersection of national security needs and international law creates a complex environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manages an extensive network infrastructure, with over 15,000 networks and millions of devices, all of which are vulnerable to cyber threats. These vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited by various actors, including state-sponsored hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorist groups. Historical breaches, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, demonstrate the severe risks to sensitive aerospace No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace data, highlighting the inadequacy of existing legal protections.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. has taken steps to address these risks, including the 2011 DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. However, these initiatives primarily focus on U.S. national interests and often fail to provide sufficient accountability for international cyber incidents. While the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) aims to bolster cybersecurity across government systems, it still struggles to address the unique vulnerabilities of aerospace infrastructure. Furthermore, existing international frameworks, such as the U.N. Guidelines and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while important, mainly focus on broader cybersecurity and data privacy issues, not the specific needs of aerospace systems.¹⁵⁶ South Korea has taken a proactive approach in addressing aerospace cybersecurity risks. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea signed a cybersecurity agreement, and the country has invested $607 million in strengthening its cybersecurity posture. This commitment highlights South Korea's leadership in tackling cybersecurity challenges. However, global efforts remain fragmented. Differences in national cybersecurity laws, data-sharing restrictions, and concerns about intellectual property protection create obstacles to effective international cooperation.¹⁵⁷ This is further complicated by the varying approaches of other countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, which have different legal frameworks for cybersecurity.\nDespite these efforts, current legal frameworks are often reactive, unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. To better secure aerospace infrastructure, there is an urgent need for a unified, legally binding international framework that promotes collaboration and ensures robust protection for critical aerospace assets.\n¹⁵⁵ THOMAS M.

Conclusion In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like\"weapon,\"\"drone,\"and\"use of force,\"making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure. These challenges are compounded by divergent national cybersecurity strategies, as demonstrated by South Korea's emphasis on No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace balancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments, contrasted with the cyber sovereignty approach of countries like China and Russia, which limit international cooperation.\nTo afford these challenges effectively, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation, whether through multilateral agreements or by establishing a global regulatory body. Looking at existing frameworks, like the Chicago Convention, could provide a solid foundation for developing global cybersecurity standards tailored to the aerospace sector. By encouraging more collaboration and aligning regulations, countries can work together to create a unified legal structure that helps reduce the risks posed by cyber threats to aerospace systems.\n^{}[]"

Introduction ## A. Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³) As aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴) The integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy reflects a shift to proactive measures, emphasizing resilience, emerging technologies, and industry-government coordination.⁶ This strategy aligns with international efforts but faces challenges due to geopolitical differences and verification issues.\nDespite South Korea's technological advances, its vulnerabilities to cyberattacks are evident, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reporting millions of hacking attempts daily. The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest ⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration Cyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations. Historically, aviation cybersecurity lacked strict oversight, but as threats evolve, international cooperation and regulatory alignment have become essential.²⁷) No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace South Korea, a global leader in technology, is developing a dynamic cybersecurity market, particularly in aviation. Government initiatives and technological advancements, including AI and digital automation, have strengthened the country's ability to address cybersecurity challenges in the aviation sector. The South Korean government has supported this growth with incentives and evolving regulatory frameworks, positioning the nation to attract international stakeholders.²⁸) Aviation cybersecurity, as defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), combines people, processes, and technology to safeguard civil aviation operations, infrastructure, and passengers from digital threats. Achieving this requires coordination among airlines, airport operators, regulators, and manufacturers.²⁹) Given the sector's interconnectedness, it is highly vulnerable to emerging threats. A notable example is the 2023 cyberattack on South Korean shipbuilders, allegedly by North Korea. This attack prompted sanctions from both South Korea and the U.S., showing the need for a unified approach to cybersecurity across industries.³⁰) International law provides the foundation for aviation cybersecurity, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) setting global standards under the Chicago Convention (1944).³¹) South Korea follows these standards through its Aviation Act No. 14114 and Aviation Act No. 14551, ensuring compliance with ICAO's cybersecurity protocols while fostering global cooperation.³²) As cyber threats evolve, frameworks like the (Network Security, Endpoint Security), By Deployment Mode (On-Premises, Cloud-Based), By Aviation (Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation), By Threat Type (Malware, Ransomware), By End-User (Airlines, Airports), By Geographic Scope And Forecast, VERIFIED MKT.

Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks The inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^ A key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement ^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

Legal Dimensions of Aerospace Cybersecurity Challenges ## 1. Regulatory Frameworks The aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets.|## 2. Liability Considerations Critical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120] The Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space No. 1: 2025 Cyber-security in Aerospace activities, including those by private companies.¹²¹) However, other countries, such as Russia, maintain state-centric liability frameworks, making the state ultimately responsible, even for private sector activities. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.|## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges The aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.|## 4. Countermeasures in International Law The application of countermeasures in cyberspace presents unique legal challenges due to the decentralized nature of enforcement in international law and the absence of a unified framework. While countermeasures are generally permitted under customary international law as responses to wrongful acts,^[132]^ their application in cyberspace is complicated by attribution issues, the involvement of private infrastructure, and varying national interpretations where some states argue cyberattacks may, in extreme cases, qualify as an\"armed attack\"under Article 51, justifying self-defense. Existing international agreements, such as the UN Charter, the Budapest Convention, and regional cybersecurity strategies, provide fragmented guidance,^[133]^ resulting in inconsistencies between domestic and international legal frameworks.^[134]^ ^[131]^ U.S. DEP'T OF THE TREAS., TREASURY SANCTIONS NORTH KOREAN STATE-SPONSORED MALICIOUS CYBER GROUPS (2019).|## C.

This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.\n\nKEYWORDS: Cybersecurity, Aerospace Law, South Korean cybersecurity law, International Law, Legal Frameworks, Data Protection, Cyber Threats, aerospace Treaties, International Cooperation, Cybersecurity Regulations, south Korean aerospace regulations\n\nManuscript received: December 14, 2024; review completed: January 10, 2025; accepted: February 10, 2025.\n\n* Ph.D. Candidate in International Law, College of Law at Seoul National University.",

Overview of Aerospace Cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial due to evolving cyber threats, especially for South Korea, one of the largest aerospace markets globally, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. South Korea's aerospace industry is led by companies like Korean Air, KAI, and Hyundai Heavy Industries, which strengthen both the aerospace and defense sectors.¹) In response to growing global competition, South Korea formed the Korea Aerospace Administration (KASA) in 2024 to unify its space policies, addressing inefficiencies from the fragmented previous framework.²) The legislation passed in 2024 empowers KASA to regulate industry, civil-military cooperation, and international agreements, signaling South Korea's ambition to become a global space leader.³)\n\nAs aerospace systems rely increasingly on advanced technologies, cybersecurity has become essential. In 2021, KAI unveiled the KF-X fighter aircraft prototype, highlighting the need for securing critical aerospace infrastructure. South Korea's Aerospace Industry and Development Promotion Act reflects the country's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity in its aerospace sector. However, experts argue the legal framework lack enforcement mechanisms to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.⁴)\n\nThe integration of space and ground systems introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Countries like the U.S. and the EU emphasize international cooperation, while China and Russia focus on cyber sovereignty.⁵)\n\n1) INT'L TRADE ADMIN., SOUTH KOREA - COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE: AEROSPACE INDUSTRY (2023).\n2) MINISTRY SCL &amp; ICT [hereinafter MSIT], BASIC DIRECTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE KOREA AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED (2023).\n3) MSIT, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA EMBARKS ON JOURNEY TOWARDS BECOMING SPACE POWERHOUSE (2024).\n4) AEROSPACE, SOUTH KOREA BETS BIG WITH ITS KF-21 (2021).\n5) Hanggongujusaneobgaebal chogjinbeob sihaenglyeong [Hanggongujusaeobbeob sihaenglyeong] [Enforcement Decree of the Aerospace Industry Development Promotion Act] (S.

The government's new cybersecurity strategy focuses on strengthening partnerships with foreign companies and increasing domestic cybersecurity investments⁷ It contrasts with more decentralized models in the U.S. and EU, where industry-driven approaches are emphasized. South Korea's centralized strategy allows the government to take a lead role in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. emphasizes public-private partnerships, and Europe adopts a decentralized, industry-driven approach, South Korea has chosen a centralized model, similar to China, Russia, and Singapore. This approach, where the government plays a leading role in cybersecurity, responds to concerns over insufficient defenses against state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea.\n\nAs the aerospace sector becomes more interconnected, the risks of cyberattacks on satellite systems, intellectual property, and supply chains continue to rise. To address these risks, both the government and aerospace companies must adopt strong cybersecurity protocols.⁸ While international cooperation is crucial for establishing unified cybersecurity standards, frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare⁹ and Budapest\n\n⁶) Natasha Wood, South Korea's 2024 Cyber Strategy: A Primer, CTR.

Furthermore, countries like China and Russia have rejected these frameworks, citing concerns over national sovereignty and differing geopolitical interests.¹¹⁾ Additionally, the U.S. has demonstrated its commitment to international cooperation through its International Strategy for Cyberspace.¹²⁾ However, adapting international norms to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging threats will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration.¹³⁾ While other countries like the U.S. and EU take more prominent leadership roles in these global discussions, South Korea's neutral geopolitical position and technological expertise allow it to play a significant role in shaping global cybersecurity regulations, offering a unique perspective that can bridge divides between Western and Eastern nations.\n\n## B. Aerospace and Defense System Involving South Korea\n\nCybersecurity in aerospace and defense is crucial in an increasingly interconnected world. The 2013 cyberattack on South Korea's institutions, attributed to North Korea, highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the country's National Cybersecurity System (NCSS). Despite reforms after earlier incidents like the 2003 Internet Crisis and 2011 DDoS attack, these measures were insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats.

AI, for example, could automate cyberattacks, while quantum computing threatens to break existing encryption systems. These advancements underscore the necessity for South Korea to adapt its legal and cybersecurity frameworks proactively, ensuring they remain effective in the face of these evolving threats.^[15]^\n\nThere is an ongoing global debate about how to address cyber risks. While international frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual and NATO's Cybersecurity National Manual have fostered cooperation, their non-binding nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms hinder consistent action. NATO's initiatives, including the 2016 Warsaw Summit Declaration, highlight the alliance's commitment to strengthening cyber defense. However, the diverse capacities and political priorities of member states continue to pose challenges, preventing a unified global response.^[16]^\n\nDespite these challenges, countries must align their laws to address shared vulnerabilities, fostering stronger cooperation.^[17]^ For South Korea, this means balancing its domestic cybersecurity needs with broader international standards, particularly in its aerospace and defense sectors.\n\nSouth Korea's National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) must therefore evolve into a more proactive and flexible framework. This shift is essential to protect critical infrastructure and counter state-sponsored threats, particularly from North Korea. To achieve this, South Korea must continuously update both its legal and technological measures to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nLooking to other global best practices, South Korea can draw inspiration from countries like the U.S. and the EU.

Collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and research institutions will help tackle emerging threats more effectively. Additionally, cross-border intelligence sharing and joint incident response mechanisms will be vital in addressing advanced persistent threats (APTs), as seen in EU and NATO partnerships.^[18]^\n\nFurthermore, South Korea must recognize the legal differences between countries and regions, particularly in cybersecurity definitions and the enforcement of cybercrime laws. The discrepancy between Western and non-Western legal frameworks can complicate international collaboration. By bridging these gaps, South Korea can enhance global cybersecurity cooperation.^[19]^\n\nTherefore, to maintain its leadership in technological innovation and safeguard national security, South Korea must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By aligning with international legal standards, enhancing cooperation with global partners, and fostering strong public-private collaboration, South Korea can protect its aerospace and defense systems and play an active role in shaping global cybersecurity practices.\n\n## II. The Importance of Cybersecurity in Aerospace Under the Law\n\nSouth Korea's aerospace industry spans air travel, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic management, and regulatory bodies, including the Enforcement Rule of the Aerospace Development Promotion Act.

    "No. 1: 2025\n\nCyber-security in Aerospace\n\nCybersecurity is essential for aviation safety and operational reliability. The integration of internet connectivity into previously isolated operational technologies (OT) has exposed new vulnerabilities, threatening aviation security. In response, regulatory measures under the Aviation Act (No. 14114) and the Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act aim to protect cyber-physical systems (CPS) and networks. However, the rapid evolution of cyber threats poses challenges in fully implementing and adapting these regulations.²⁰)\n\nSouth Korea faces specific cybersecurity challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern protections. The rapid pace of digital transformation has made it difficult to update national regulatory frameworks in line with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. While South Korea aligns many of its policies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, continuous adaptation is necessary to safeguard critical aviation infrastructure.\n\nGlobally, aerospace cybersecurity is governed by frameworks from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA), and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). South Korea actively participates in these efforts, incorporating best practices from Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which established the first global cybersecurity standards in aviation.²¹) The ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 – Restricted)²²) provides further implementation guidance, and South Korea's Aviation Act and Enforcement Decree of the Aviation Safety Act ensure compliance with these international standards.²³)\n\nWhile international agreements provide a broad regulatory framework, South Korea tailors its laws to address national security concerns, critical\n\n20) The Claroty Team, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Protecting the Skies in the Digital Age, CLAROTY (Jan. 25, 2024), https://claroty.com/blog/aerospace-cybersecurity-protecting-the-skies-in-the-digital-age.\n\n21) ICAO’s key legislative role is developing Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for international aviation, incorporated into the 19 annexes of the Chicago Convention.

The Aviation Act ensures air operators comply with cybersecurity requirements that align with global standards while addressing local needs, such as data protection and system resilience.²⁴)\n\nAt the European level, EASA has been instrumental in incorporating cybersecurity into aviation regulations. Though non-binding, initiatives like the EU Strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation,²⁵) developed by the European Strategic Coordination Platform on Cybersecurity in Aviation, serve as key references for future regulatory advancements. South Korea aligns its policies with these initiatives to enhance international cooperation.²⁶)\n\nAlthough the legal framework for aerospace cybersecurity is still evolving, both globally and in South Korea, substantial progress has been made. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, continued vigilance and regulatory adaptation are essential. South Korea's active role in global cybersecurity dialogues, adoption of international standards, and commitment to modernizing its regulatory framework reinforce its position as a key player in ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of global aviation operations.\n\n## A. Cybersecurity in Aviation and Frameworks and South Korea Legal Integration\n\nCyberattacks on aviation organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, ranging from ransomware to GPS spoofing, making it more urgent to implement robust regulations.

Legal Challenges in Aerospace Cybersecurity\n\n### A. Inconsistent Enforcement of International Law in Cybersecurity Attacks\n\nThe inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks presents a significant challenge, particularly in the aerospace sector, where cyber threats have escalated in recent years. While international conventions such as the Hague and Montreal Conventions provide legal frameworks for addressing crimes against civil aviation, their application remains uneven.^[73]^ Some nations rigorously enforce cybersecurity measures, while others fail to implement or comply with existing regulations, creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network.^[74]^\n\nA key issue lies in the lack of enforceable international standards and mechanisms to address cybersecurity threats in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations (UN) have recognized this gap and have taken steps to promote cybersecurity cooperation.^[75]^ ICAO, for instance, has established the Universal Security Audit Program, which assesses member states' implementation of cybersecurity measures.^[76]^ However, compliance remains inconsistent, and enforcement\n\n^[73]^ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal On 23 September 1971 Signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, INT'L CIV.

Similarly, UN initiatives on cybersecurity, including efforts by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aim to establish global norms, but their effectiveness is hindered by varying national interests and regulatory frameworks.77)\n\nSouth Korea has taken proactive steps to enhance cybersecurity cooperation, particularly through agreements with the United States and Japan to counter cyber threats from North Korea.78) However, these efforts highlight the broader issue: while bilateral and regional agreements may strengthen cybersecurity in specific areas, they do not provide a comprehensive global solution. The lack of a universal regulatory body for aerospace cybersecurity allows certain states to evade responsibility, contributing to legal uncertainty and security risks.79)\n\nThe challenges in enforcing international cybersecurity regulations are compounded by the absence of collective sanctions for non-compliance. Historical attempts, such as the 1973 ICAO conference on collective sanctions, failed due to states' unwillingness to compromise their sovereignty.80) This reluctance persists today, making it difficult to establish binding cybersecurity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms.\n\nComparing international approaches, countries such as the United States and European Union member states have developed stringent cybersecurity regulations, incorporating mandatory reporting requirements and financial penalties for non-compliance. In contrast, other nations, particularly those with state-sponsored cyber activities, have resisted such frameworks, further exacerbating the enforcement disparity.81)\n\n77) Allison Pytlak &amp; Shreya Lad, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Cyber Accountability: Tracing How Activities of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Foster Cyber Accountability, STIMSON (Sept. 24, 2024), https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-international-telecommunications-union-itu-and-cyber-accountability/.\n\n78) Hyunsu Yim &amp; Ju-min Park, U.S., South Korea, Japan to Step Up Actions on North Korea Cyber Threats, REUTERS (Dec. 9, 2023, 8:34 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us-skorea-japan-security-advisors-seoul-trilateral-meeting-2023-12-09/.\n\n79) Hyuna Kim, Corea del Sur, E.E.

This would involve creating an independent regulatory body to oversee compliance, similar to existing aviation safety organizations. Additionally, mechanisms such as financial penalties or trade restrictions could serve as deterrents for non-compliance, compelling states to adhere to international cybersecurity standards.^[82]^\n\nUltimately, the inconsistent enforcement of international law in cybersecurity attacks highlight the urgent need for stronger global cooperation.

Lack of Internationally Agreed Definitions of Key Terminology in Cyber and Space Domains\n\nThe lack of standardized definitions for key terms like \"cyber weapon\" and \"space debris\" creates significant barriers to international cooperation, preventing the establishment of unified legal frameworks. These ambiguities complicate multilateral agreements and foster legal fragmentation in both cyber and space security.\n\nIn cybersecurity, divergent national definitions of terms such as \"cybercrime\" and \"cyber weapon\"90) create inconsistencies in how states interpret and enforce international norms. Western countries, for instance, focus on \"cybersecurity\" as a means of protecting networks, while China and Russia define \"information security\" as encompassing state control over digital information. This divide is evident in agreements like the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, which Western nations reject due to concerns over free expression restrictions. The absence of a legally binding definition of \"cyber weapon\" further complicates international law, especially in the context of jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles, as countries interpret cyber operations in varying ways.91)\n\nSimilarly, in space law, the terms \"space weapon\" and \"space debris\" remain undefined, leading to uncertainty in legal governance.

Voluntary guidelines from COPUOS and the IADC are insufficient, as they do not create enforceable standards.⁹⁴)\n\nThese inconsistencies in both cyber and space security arise from geopolitical tensions. The U.S. advocates for a multi-stakeholder model in cybersecurity, promoting private sector involvement, while China and Russia prioritize state sovereignty over digital information flows. In space law, the EU pushes for binding Space Traffic Management (STM) frameworks, but major space powers resist such commitments. National positions, such as those of the U.S., China, Russia, and South Korea, reflect these differing priorities, with South Korea taking a flexible stance by supporting voluntary guidelines on both issues while avoiding firm positions on contentious matters like ASAT regulations.⁹⁵)\n\nCurrent initiatives, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and COPUOS' efforts on space sustainability, demonstrate attempts to address these gaps, but without legally binding definitions, they fail to overcome the barriers to international cooperation.⁹⁶) To move forward, international legal frameworks need clearer, universally accepted definitions that reflect the evolving challenges of both domains, ensuring that emerging technologies can be governed effectively while respecting national interests.\n\n(2008), interpret \"non-aggressive\" rather than \"non-military,\" which allows for military uses of outer space.

Regulatory Frameworks\n\nThe aerospace sector is governed by a complex regulatory framework involving both domestic regulations and international agreements. In the case of South Korea, the regulatory foundation for the aerospace sector, represented by the Korean Aviation Act, is aligned with the 1944 Chicago Convention but remains fragmented due to overlapping jurisdiction among ministries. $^{111}$ This decentralized oversight complicates compliance and weakens the country's alignment with global regulatory standards. Additionally, South Korea's limited participation in international aviation conventions restricts its influence in shaping global norms, affecting its competitiveness and integration into international markets. $^{112}$\n\n109) Kurt Gottfried &amp; Richard Ned Lebow, Anti-Satellite Weapons: Weighing the Risks, 114 DAEDALUS 147, 154 (1985).\n\n110) Arvind Mistry, Aerospace Cybersecurity: Comprehensive Industry Insights, SHARETRU (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.sharetru.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-aerospace-industry-regulations-cybersecurity.\n\n111) Robert S.

    "No. 1: 2025\n\nCyber-security in Aerospace\n\nAt the national level, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) faces regulatory gaps in manufacturing standards, particularly in parts production technologies such as surface and heat treatment. The absence of a comprehensive legal infrastructure impairs compliance with international requirements, hindering technological advancement and export potential. The lack of a centralized regulatory authority also results in inefficiencies in legal enforcement and resource allocation.[113]\n\nRecognizing these challenges, South Korea has initiated reforms, including the establishment of the Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA) $^{114}$  in 2024 to consolidate space policy and regulatory oversight. $^{115}$  However, discrepancies between domestic and international legal frameworks persist, particularly regarding cybersecurity. The 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy marks a shift toward a more assertive posture, but its integration into the aerospace sector remains uncertain. $^{116}$  Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, further challenge the adaptability of current global cybersecurity regulations, which lack legally binding enforcement mechanisms. $^{117}$\n\nRegarding international actors, organizations such as ICAO and IATA have established cybersecurity guidelines, but compliance remains voluntary, leading to regulatory inconsistencies. Differences in national regulatory approaches—such as those between the U.S. (FAA) and the EU (EASA)—highlight the broader challenge of harmonizing legal frameworks. National positions diverge based on security priorities, economic interests, and geopolitical considerations, making consensus on key issues such as data protection, cyber resilience, and liability in cross-border operations difficult to achieve.[118]\n\nTo address the legal gaps in aerospace cybersecurity, it is crucial to",
    "Journal of Korean Law\n\nVol. 24: 83\n\nstrengthen coordination among national governments, international organizations, and industry stakeholders. Key challenges include the absence of binding international agreements, fragmented regulations, and inconsistencies between national and international laws, all of which contribute to compliance difficulties. Efforts like ICAO's cybersecurity strategy, EASA's regulations, and the EU-U.S. Cybersecurity Dialogue aim to establish common standards, while national initiatives, such as South Korea's 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, emphasize the need for greater alignment. However, without enforceable global frameworks, jurisdictional overlaps and governance gaps will continue, undermining cybersecurity efforts.\n\n## 2. Liability Considerations\n\nCritical Legal Analysis: The legal framework governing space liability is primarily rooted in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1972 Liability Convention. The OST, under Article VI, holds states responsible for national space activities, whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities. The Liability Convention, in turn, outlines absolute liability for damages caused by space objects on Earth (Article II) and fault-based liability for damages caused by space objects in outer space (Article III). However, these treaties fail to address evolving issues in space law, particularly as private sector involvement has significantly expanded and cybersecurity threats have escalated.[119] For example, the increasing participation of private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin has led to legal gaps not fully covered by these treaties, creating new risks for both state and private actors. These evolving issues are not sufficiently contemplated within the existing framework.[120]\n\nThe Liability Convention's provisions create inconsistencies between national laws and international obligations. Countries like South Korea have implemented national regulations with strict liability for space\n\n119) Space Law Treaties and Principles, U.N. OFF.

This discrepancy underscores a fundamental inconsistency between international frameworks, like the OST, which holds states responsible for both government and private activities, and domestic laws that prioritize state responsibility for private sector operations.¹²²) The United States, with its hybrid approach, and the European Union, with its evolving policy on space activities, further illustrate the lack of harmonization in legal practices across different jurisdictions.\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the increasing significance of cybersecurity in aerospace operations. Cyberattacks on space assets, such as satellites or space station systems, raise additional concerns about liability.¹²³) Current legal frameworks do not sufficiently address the liability implications of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, if a cyberattack disrupts a satellite's communication capabilities, resulting in significant financial damage, the allocation of responsibility is unclear. Existing laws fail to clearly define liability in such cases, whether it lies with the private company operating the satellite, the country of origin, or third-party service providers.¹²⁴) These gaps create significant risks and uncertainties for stakeholders in the space sector, especially given the rapid development of new technologies.\n\nCurrent international initiatives, such as the review by COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) of the Liability Convention, seek to update these outdated provisions, but they are hindered by significant national differences. Countries like Russia and China prefer a state-centric model that limits private sector autonomy, while countries\n\n¹²¹) Setsuko Aoki, *Domestic Legal Conditions for Space Activities in Asia*, 113 AJIL UNBOUND 103, 105-06 (2019).\n\n¹²²) Innovations Trends Market, *South Korea Property/Casualty Insurance Market By Type*, LINKEDIN (Oct. 26, 2024), https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/south-korea-propertycasualty-insurance-market-tnblc/.\n\n¹²³) Dov Goldman, *What is Cyber Liability?*, PANORAYS (July 15, 2020), https://panorays.com/blog/what-is-cyber-liability/.\n\n¹²⁴) Doo Hwan Kim, *Space Law and Policy in the Republic of Korea*, U.N.

This divergence points to the difficulty in reaching a consensus on the international stage. These inconsistencies reflect the broader challenge in reconciling national legal positions with international obligations, highlighting the need for a more uniform, comprehensive framework for space liability.\n\n## 3. Jurisdictional Challenges\n\nThe aerospace industry faces significant jurisdictional challenges in addressing cyberattacks due to its global dimension and the interconnectedness of systems and networks. These challenges are particularly complex when considering the various national and international regulations that do not align, creating legal gaps and discoordination in responding to cyber incidents. Despite international efforts, cooperation remains insufficient to ensure an effective and coordinated response to cyber incidents in such a critical sector.\n\nJurisdictional principles traditionally based on territoriality and nationality—established in international conventions such as the 2001 Cybercrime Convention—are not easily adapted to the realities of transnational cybercrimes. Although territoriality (Article 22(1) of the Convention) grants state the authority to act on crimes committed within their borders, the digital globalization and the decentralized nature of cyber infrastructure make it difficult to apply this rule.¹²⁵ As Brenner and Koops (2004) point out, cybercrime does not easily fit within the traditional jurisdictional rules, especially in aerospace, where systems are interconnected globally.¹²⁶\n\nFurthermore, the principles of active nationality and passive nationality (Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention) extend jurisdiction beyond physical borders, allowing states to claim authority over cybercrimes committed by their nationals or that affect their interests. However, this extended jurisdiction can also generate tensions between countries, particularly when the\n\n¹²⁵) Elochukwu Ukwandu et al., *Cyber-Security Challenges in the Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends*, 13 INFO, 146 (2022).\n\n¹²⁶) *Sovereignty and Jurisdiction*, U.N.

Inconsistencies in data protection and jurisdictional thresholds between nations further complicate cooperation. For example, the EU, with the GDPR, faces significant differences with countries that do not have equally strict regulations, creating conflicts of law that hinder collaboration.[127]\n\nEach nation has its own interpretation of how to handle transnational cybercrimes. While the United States has promoted a stance of cyber sovereignty and active cooperation, favoring bilateral agreements such as the CISA-NIS Memorandum, other countries have adopted more cautious approaches due to concerns about digital sovereignty. Particularly, countries in Asia and Latin America often resist accepting norms imposed by foreign powers, preferring systems that protect their national interests.[128]\n\nFor example, China has been one of the most influential nations in promoting a sovereign internet model, rejecting international frameworks that do not align with its own normative interests. China's position reflects a governance model in which cybersecurity is paramount, and national control over cyberspace takes precedence over international initiatives.[129] This contrasts with the stance of the United States and many European countries, which favor a more integrated global governance, with increased efforts at international cooperation and harmonization of standards.[130]\n\nInitiatives like the UN Cybersecurity Expert Group or the International Cyber Dialogue (ICD) attempt to establish a more cohesive global framework, but the lack of a binding treaty prevents significant progress in creating universal norms.

The differences in approach between global powers and developing nations highlight the need for a model that allows for a balance between sovereignty and cooperation. The harmonization of laws through an international body regulating cybersecurity norms in key sectors like aerospace is crucial.

    "No. 1: 2025\n\nCyber-security in Aerospace\n\nNational cybersecurity policies reveal divergent legal approaches. For instance, the U.S. Cyber Strategy (2023) supports both defensive and offensive cyber operations under the principle of deterrence.[135] In contrast, the EU Cybersecurity Act (2019) prioritizes collective resilience and regulatory measures over unilateral countermeasures.[136] Meanwhile, China[137] and Russia[138], both advocating for cyber sovereignty, reject Western-centric models and limit international cooperation, further complicating the formation of a global consensus.[139] The lack of a binding international treaty leads to legal uncertainty, especially regarding the line between permissible countermeasures and prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.[140]\n\nDespite efforts to harmonize international responses, current initiatives remain insufficient. The Tallinn Manual provides a non-binding interpretation of how international law applies to cyber operations but lacks enforceability. The NATO framework recognizes cyberattacks as potential triggers for collective defense (Article 5), yet responses remain discretionary. Economic countermeasures, such as the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, illustrate how states use non-military tools to address cyber threats, but their effectiveness depends on political consensus and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nThe gaps in aerospace cybersecurity present significant risks. The dependence on private infrastructure, the cross-border flow of data, and the potential for widespread impacts from cyber incidents highlight the need for stronger regulatory coordination. South Korea, a key player in both cybersecurity and aerospace, illustrates these challenges.

While current legal frameworks recognize cyber countermeasures, their inconsistent application limits their effectiveness. A more cohesive approach, whether through a multilateral agreement or strengthened regulatory mechanisms, would help establish legal clarity, ensure proportionality, and enhance enforcement in an increasingly complex cyber landscape.\n\n## IV. Legal Imperatives for Enhanced Aerospace Cybersecurity\n\n### A. Compliance with International Law\n\nThe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into international aviation law has advanced significantly since 2014, with key contributions from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the European Commission. These efforts have primarily focused on creating frameworks for air traffic control, integrating airspace, and establishing operational standards to ensure the safe integration of UAS into the aviation ecosystem. However, as unmanned systems become more widespread, especially with the rapid growth of digital technologies, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, one that remains inadequately addressed by existing legal frameworks.[142]\n\nA closer examination of the current legal landscape highlights significant gaps in addressing the cybersecurity needs of UAS.

Fortifying Aerospace Cybersecurity Through Global Cooperation\n\nCybersecurity threats in the aerospace sector are inherently global, as cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities that transcend national borders. Given the impracticality of complete isolation from the global internet, international cooperation is essential for protecting aviation infrastructure. However, while various initiatives aim to enhance global cybersecurity, regulatory fragmentation and political divergences hinder their effectiveness.\n\nA key initiative in this domain is the International Cybersecurity Information Sharing Project, which facilitates government-to-government agreements for exchanging threat intelligence. While such agreements enable technological and policy collaboration, they remain opaque and limited in scope. Moreover, terminology inconsistencies and conflicting national priorities weaken their practical impact.[151]\n\nInternational cooperation takes multiple forms, including threat intelligence exchange, policy coordination, and capacity-building efforts, particularly in developing nations. However, differences in regulatory frameworks pose challenges. South Korea, for instance, aligns its policies with ICAO Annex 17 and collaborates with Japan and ASEAN nations, illustrating a regional cybersecurity approach. By contrast, major powers like the United States and China prioritize national security over multilateral commitments, creating an uneven regulatory landscape. The U.S. leans towards unilateral cyber defense, while China's 2017 cybersecurity law underscores its distinct approach to data governance, raising concerns over global internet regulations.[152]\n\nExisting international agreements, such as the Tokyo Convention and the Beijing Instruments of 2010, acknowledge cybersecurity's importance in\n\n151) Anupam Chander &amp; Sandeep Lemos, International Cybersecurity: The Role of International Law and Global Cooperation, 130 HARV.

Western nations focus on advanced cyber defense, while developing countries prioritize basic cybersecurity infrastructure, exacerbating policy misalignment.^[153]^\n\nTo address these challenges, fostering inclusive cooperation is critical. South Korea's engagement in ICAO Annex 17 demonstrates how countries can balance national security with global collaboration. However, a truly effective approach requires integrating diverse national perspectives, particularly those of non-Western nations facing unique regulatory and security constraints.^[154]^\n\nWhile cooperation is indispensable, the fundamental issue is not merely the lack of coordination but also the absence of political will to relinquish sovereign control over cybersecurity governance.

Conclusion\n\nIn today's interconnected world, cybersecurity in the aerospace and defense sectors is critical to protecting national security and safeguarding vital infrastructure. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, combined with the lack of a unified international framework, expose significant vulnerabilities. The differing national positions, along with inconsistencies in how cybersecurity laws are interpreted and applied across countries, such as South Korea's approach to balancing sovereignty with international cooperation, further complicate efforts to address these challenges globally.\n\nOne of the primary issues is the fragmented implementation of international treaties. Countries prioritize different goals, national security, sovereignty, and international collaboration, resulting in a patchwork of legal frameworks. These disparities are particularly evident in the varying definitions of terms like \"weapon,\" \"drone,\" and \"use of force,\" making it difficult to establish unified cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, the absence of a binding international treaty creates substantial enforcement gaps, hindering an effective global response to cyber threats, particularly within the aerospace sector.\n\nWhile international agreements like the Budapest Convention and the Chicago Convention offer some legal foundation, they often fail to address the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. The Tallinn Manual, providing guidelines on the application of international law to cyber warfare, serves as an important reference for cyber norms in warfare but remains non-binding and limited in its applicability to broader sectors like aerospace and defense. Other initiatives, such as the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, have worked to build consensus on state behavior in cyberspace, but none have led to binding agreements or the establishment of a global cybersecurity regulatory body.\n\nThe lack of a cohesive and binding international framework results in inefficiencies in both enforcement and coordination, making it increasingly difficult for nations to combat cyber threats and protect critical aerospace infrastructure.

    "abstract": "The aerospace sector, comprising aviation, airports, airlines, and their subcontractors, is increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to its heavy reliance on digital technologies for crucial operations such as navigation, communication, and data management. This paper examines the legal frameworks that address cybersecurity risks in this vital industry, focusing on South Korea's domestic regulations alongside international law. By reviewing South Korea's data protection policies and key international treaties, the study identifies significant gaps in existing cybersecurity laws. It highlights the limitations of these frameworks, pointing out inconsistencies in definitions and enforcement challenges in international agreements like the Budapest and Chicago Conventions. The paper also looks at initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual – a non-binding guide on applying international law to cyber warfare – and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity, which aim to set norms for cyber operations but fall short of establishing binding global standards. The findings emphasize the need to align legal frameworks and improve cross-border cooperation to effectively address the growing cybersecurity risks facing the aerospace sector. These recommendations would provide practical guidance for legal practitioners analyzing this complex landscape, ultimately ensuring both national security and the protection of critical infrastructure.
