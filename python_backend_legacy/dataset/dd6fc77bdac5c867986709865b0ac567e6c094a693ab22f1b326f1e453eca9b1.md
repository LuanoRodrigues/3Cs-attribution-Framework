Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies.[30] Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games.[31] Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration.",

Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies. Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games. Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration.",

    "## Abstract": "Conventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.",
    "## Keywords": "Cyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.",
    "## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace": "### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies.[30] Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games.[31] Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.",
    "## How to entangle friends and adversaries": "Having established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.",
    "## The entanglement zone": "Entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.",
    "## Conclusion": "Entanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration."

Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies. Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games. Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration.",

Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies. Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games. Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration."

Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies. Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games. Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration."

Brantly\n## Abstract\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n## Keywords\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by\nRobert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n### Deterrence by punishment\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies.[30] Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games.[31] Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually\nreinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.\nFourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires\nsignaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.\nEntanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n## The entanglement zone\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,\nleveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which\nstates interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on\nalterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n## Conclusion\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance\nthe concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration."

  "payload": "## ## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through\nresearch, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that\nsoldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n### Deterrence by denial\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce\nthe likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are\nongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n### Minding the gap\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies.[30] Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games.[31] Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on\nprospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering\nlong-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.\n#\nA. F. BRANTLY\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key\nis to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion\n\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain.

    "# Entanglement in Cyberspace: Minding the Deterrence Gap\n\nAaron F. Brantly\n\n## Abstract\n\nConventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.\n\n## Keywords\n\nCyberspace, deterrence, entanglement, conflict\n\nCyberspace is growing rapidly and presently encompasses more than 17 billion connected devices with tens of billions more to be added in the coming decades.1 Beyond the vast scale of cyberspace are the multiplicity of actors consistently engaged in a wide variety of activities that span the spectrum of human interactions. The present models for national security and defense were structured under conditions in which a leviathan at the state level held most if not all the levers of power.2 Models predicated on unitary rational actors and notions of threats punishment were developed and applied in a world in which the overt utilization of weapons and acts of war were unable to be easily obfuscated. Despite the largely overt nature of conventional conflict, problems relating to deterrence remain. In cyberspace where conflict is rarely overt and threats of punishment all too often ring hollow, for both a lack of credibility and an inability to signal, conventional deterrence as a mechanism to deter potential adversaries falls short.3 This essay picks up Joseph Nye's 2017 argument highlighting a new approach to deterrence in cyberspace facilitated by entanglement.4 Entanglement fits within Glenn Snyder's concept of “broad deterrence” and is closely related to neo-liberalism initially developed by",
    "Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye.^{5} At its most basic entanglement is the involvement of adversaries and allies in complicated patterns of behavior and interaction (a relationship) from which it is difficult to escape or alter without incurring substantial costs. Specifically, entanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. The argument advanced below is that entanglement fits within the gap between strategies of deterrence by denial and threats of punishment. Entanglement can alter, under the conditions established within complex interdependence, the perceptions of an actor's own behaviors in relation to the system in which she is interacting both in the short and long term.\n\nTo assess the additive value of entanglement to deterrence I briefly examine why conventional deterrence fails in cyberspace and the implications of this failure are over time. Second, I construct a model for deterrence by entanglement and explain the mechanisms by which entanglement are likely to shift perceptions of adversaries and facilitate self-deterrent behavior. Third, I examine the limitations of entanglement and how deterrence by entanglement can be achieved. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of deterrence by entanglement, its impact on systemic stability amongst state actors within cyberspace, and its limitations.\n\n## Deterrence by threats of punishment and denial in cyberspace\n\n### Deterrence by punishment\n\nAlexander George and Richard Smoke in their seminal work on deterrence write; “in its most general form, deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and or risks of a given course of action he might take outweigh the benefits”.^{6} Whether establishing deterrence by threat of punishment or denial as Thomas Schelling notes, actors must first establish credibility.^{7} To establish credibility requires an actor to undertake costs before an attack. Credibility depends both on the ability and the will of the defender to retaliate, or in the case of denial to set aside the material costs necessary to establish a reasonable denial structure.^{8} Credibility as an interaction variable between will and ability requires at first a measure of disaggregation. In the absence of mitigating circumstances, the will to respond to a violation is dependent on the ability to respond. Although there are instances in which the will to respond to a given violation might be constrained by any number of political or environmental considerations, the will to respond must necessarily match the capability to respond for it to be credible. The mere presence of will in the absence of capability is nothing more than bluster.\n\nTo establish the capability to punish, states must incur costs.^{9} Costs associated with deterrence by punishment are most commonly incurred through",
    "research, development and manufacturing of new weapon systems, the provisioning of Armies, Navies and Air Forces, the strengthening of alliances with complementary capabilities and maintenance. In the nuclear age, this often meant developing and acquiring more accurate, powerful, and voluminous strategic weapon systems. In conventional conflict this means developing large armies, navies or air forces capable of inflicting harm on a potential adversary if a violation occurs.\n\nWhen these weapon systems are utilized additional costs are undertaken by the defender beyond the costs incurred by the violation itself. Viewed from the perspective of the defender (deterrer) there are three distinct periods of costs with the latter two overlapping. Defenders must incur costs to signal a credible deterrent. Costs are incurred in the form of fiscal outlays for the production of capabilities, resources or other material or human capital provisioned for defensive purposes and diplomatic activities that result in binding agreements to mutual defense. Incurred costs to establish initial capability are not static and need continual maintenance and improvement. Maintenance and improvement necessitate continuous resource allocation. Even when attacked, the maintenance costs associated do not disappear but rather remain until such time as the threat of punishment is actuated and the resultant level of costs once again increases above those of maintaining the capability. Often the cost of retaliation can exceed the initial cost of capability creation. For instance, the training and provisioning of an Army in garrison is substantially less expensive than the deployment and provisioning of an Army in the field. As a violation occurs the defender must simultaneously account for the costs being imposed upon it by the violator as well as those costs it must subsequently undertake to exact punishment in line with its deterrent threat.\n\nTo date costs undertaken to signal credibility for deterrence by threats of punishment in cyberspace for the United States include the development of 133 cyber national mission teams, the provision of billions of dollars of investment to stand up United States Cyber Command and the creation branch level-cyber forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Maine Corps. The NSA and CIA have also continued the development of cyber capabilities. By all accounts each of these organizations is developing a variety of exploits, defined in JP 3--12 Cyberspace Operations Doctrine as cyber capabilities. However, unlike in the physical domains of land, sea, air and space, the lifespan of the capabilities developed are temporally constrained by both changes in technology through the evolution of software and hardware platforms, the maintenance of existing platforms and the frequency with which those platforms are connected or able to be accessed via the Internet. These challenges combine to limit the ability to continually hold assets at risk and limits the repeatability of threats. The specialized nature of training required to engage in war fighting activities within cyberspace means that",
    "soldiers assigned to cyber missions are not interchangeable in the same way as infantry soldiers.\n\nThe U.S. currently demonstrates credibility through the establishment of human capital and technical capabilities. Yet these capabilities are variable on a day to day, week to week and year to year cycle that is partially regularized within market forces for corporate actors, but also irregular in general maintenance and availability of assets. The creation of a new bullet does not obviate the effectiveness of the old one. New body armor might reduce the effectiveness of previous bullets, but still subject the wearer to substantial risk of bodily harm. By contrast, the acquisition of new systems or the patching of old operating systems for Windows, Linux or Mac might obviate entire classes of cyber weapon systems (capabilities) and thereby diminish the credibility of existing capabilities.\n\nPunishment is designed to reduce the benefits accrued to the attacker. Yet, because it is uncertain what the exact utility calculus of the attacker is, calibration of the punishment is difficult. Too much and the response becomes disproportionate and too little and it does not deter. Moreover, the costs of developing exploits relative to the costs of defense in cyberspace is almost always asymmetric. Because only the attacker knows the full extent of its attack in the proximate timeframe it is likely to accrue a disproportionate benefit relative to the costs imposed by its target thereby making punishment strategies highly inefficient.\n\nMoreover, in contrast to conventional conflict punishment is unlikely to qualitatively degrade an adversary's capabilities over time. The removal of an adversary from the Internet temporarily does not eliminate the potential for future threats. Instead, what is likely to result is a tit-for-tat interaction that neither dissuades nor imparts substantial credibility for deterrence by punishment.\n\nCyber deterrence by threat of punishment in isolation is a suboptimal strategy. It is difficult to demonstrate credibility, to signal intent and to hold assets at risk such that they alter the cost-benefit calculus of an adversary. Deterrence by threat of punishment does function in extreme cases where an adversary crosses a substantial threshold that elevates an attack beyond within domain responses to provide justification for reasonable and proportional cross-domain (i.e. kinetic responses) responses. Previous analyses have indicated that it is only at the highest level of state to state interaction that threats of punishment in cyberspace are truly effective at constraining state behavior. Under conditions that eliminate the attribution problem and that elevate potential proportional responses to kinetic levels -- punishment options are likely to be as effective in cyberspace as in any other domain, but these conditions are rare.\n\n### Deterrence by denial\n\nBeyond deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial offers unique qualities that elevate the costs to an adversary in the pre-attack phase that might reduce",
    "the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. In denial strategies costs remain constant or increase over time in response to the changing environment. Most denial costs are incurred with the intent of making it more difficult for malicious behaviors resulting in violations that rise to a level warranting cross domain kinetic responses. Denial strategies are continuous and cannot stop even when the defender suffers additional costs due to an attack. Lowering the denial costs following an attack would expose the defender to additional attacks by the both the successful attacker as well as other potential adversaries.\n\nDenial strategies are ubiquitous and attackers assume costs due to the denial strategy in the pre-attack phase up until the point where they achieve access to the network or system. Subsequently the perception of costs due to denial strategies diminish and are replaced both by costs associated with maintaining presence and the benefits of access. Benefits often peak and then trail off, but the perception of denial costs relative to this benefit are no longer present. The costs of denial return in iterated attacks seeking to exploit new systems or networks or different aspects within a given system or network not previously breached and the cycle repeats.\n\nDeterrence by denial reduces success of attackers in some instances where attacker resources are limited. Where aggregate costs associated with accomplishing a given attack do not achieve a certain utility other targets are sought out. Deterrence by denial does not require attribution and instead focuses on building logical, psychological and physical barriers to entry for would be cyber attackers. Deterrence by denial is a critical part of fostering security within cyberspace. Just as banks build vaults or other security mechanisms to prevent would be robbers from stealing all the money, cyber defenders must build physical and logical barriers that elevate the difficulty associated with malicious activities.\n\nBoth deterrence by threats of punishment and denial are applicable in cyberspace. Both concepts have been widely explored. Deterrence by threats of punishment work best when the stakes are high, and considerations of attribution and identification of perpetrators are more readily apparent. Under these conditions threats of punishment extend beyond cyberspace and become credible. Threats appear in many instances to be having a substantive impact on preventing the utilization of cyber capabilities and have led to more deliberate attacks a levels below the proverbial “red-line”. The result likely induces states and their hackers to work as close to the red-lines as possible without crossing them, or when crossing them to feign ignorance as to the location of the line or disclaim the attack. Correspondingly, deterrence by denial works best at the other end of the spectrum where making entry into systems and networks more difficult raises costs and prevents easy access. Between the two there is a large gap in which serious incidents of cyber-attack occur -- but not serious enough to result escalation into the kinetic domain occurs. This gap results in substantial consternation between parties. All parties recognize that malicious activities are",
    "ongoing, but few are able to adequately address the challenge presented by the gap between these two forms of deterrence.\n\n### Minding the gap\n\nBetween the two sides of the spectrum are attacks that continually challenge governments and businesses critical to national security. Filling the gap with increased efforts to deny adversary access have proven challenging and increasingly costly. To circumvent these constraints security officials have attempted to manipulate the perceptions of adversaries. In 2014 Secretary General Rasmussen in a speech at the United States Military Academy declared that NATO maintains an “ambiguous deterrence” strategy.\n\nYet, among central tenets of deterrence theory prevalent from early deterrence scholars such as Bernard Brodie, Thomas Schelling, and others is the need to establish clear, unambiguous signals to potential adversaries of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Moreover, upon violation, states must have the ability to successfully act upon threats and have an adversary clearly understand that these acts of punishment are linked to their violations of preestablished red-lines. Cyberspace complicates both sides of this equation. First, it is difficult to convey where and what a red-line is in cyberspace, and second it is very difficult to threaten or hold at risk an asset in cyberspace after a violation has occurred. The US possesses the capabilities to achieve strategic, operational and tactical effects in and through cyberspace, but, how to incorporate these into a robust strategy of deterrence remains unsettled. Challenges associated with deterrence in and through cyberspace were further highlighted by both the former USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Rogers and the current USCYBERCOM Commander LTG Nakasone in Congressional testimony in February 2018.\n\nChris Demchak and Peter Dombrowski consider the future of cyberspace as leading to a new “Cybered Westphalian Age,” emphasizing relative over absolute gains. Their logic is well-rooted in neo-realist theories. However, another potential path forward for enhancing stability and deterrence within cyberspace does not focus on the building of barriers and the establishment of hard sovereignty over cyberspace, but rather a world in which the barriers are lowered and states are induced into circumstances that change their cost and benefits calculus.\n\nEntanglement challenges the notion that states can ever fully secure themselves in an ever-evolving human constructed and soon human and machine made technological domain. Entanglement is worthy of examination because it alters the costs and benefits matrix from pre-attack and post-attack to one that emphasizes the management of risk aversion and risk seeking through a continuous relationship between parties. Entanglement as a strategy intertwines the circumstances of states in such a way that it is",
    "#\n\nA. F. BRANTLY\n\ndifficult and costly to extract themselves. Entanglement can enhance benefits of cooperation such that it creates a disincentive (risk aversion) and minimizes risk seeking by an adversary.\n\nFigure 1 below stylizes the view of entanglement and highlights the general perception of costs versus benefits within this strategy. In the pre-attack phase both attacker and defender receive benefits from entanglement. When one state undermines its entanglement by engaging in attacks against the defender it both loses benefits from engagement and gains benefits from its attack. The defender experiences costs associated with the attack and also the loss of benefits derived from the relationship. Following an attack, a defender can reestablish entanglement or disincentivize future attacks by leaving the level of entanglement at a lower level.\n\nFigure 2 below examines the perceptions of the attacker. The attacker and the defender in an entangled system both receive benefits from the relationship. The attacker will lose benefits as it seeks to achieve gains at the expense of the defender. In contrast to threats of punishment where there is a high necessity of attribution in entanglement reputation can be equally important. If a defender suspects a violation by an adversary, it can reduce the benefits of entanglement unless the adversary is able to demonstrate innocence. This facilitates a more responsive action and reaction pairing than that of\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Defender perceptions of entanglement costs and benefits.",
    "DEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n\n#\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Attacker perceptions of costs and benefits from entanglement.\n\npunishment which is offset due to the need to attribute. Moreover, because there is an incentive to dissuade third parties from imitating one's own state all states have an incentive to foster enforcement. The result is both self-deterrence that encourages an adversary to avoid losing benefits already gained through entanglement and extended deterrence of an adversary to third parties to maintain reputation and prevent losses of benefits.\n\nJoseph Nye and Robert Keohane developed the concept of complex interdependence and highlighted the importance of absolute gains brought about through deepening ties between nations across sectors, in particular within their economies.[30] Their work was further bolstered by Robert Axelrod's analysis of iterative prisoner's dilemma games.[31] Axelrod demonstrated that it was possible, through iterated interactions, to extend the shadow of the future outward to create a more robust steady state by engaging in a tit-for-tat strategy. These works provide a foundation for how and why entanglement can foster stability. Yet, they do not adequately explain why states are less likely to violate another state's red lines in a system defined by entanglement.\n\nIf Axelrod's argument indicates that iterated games in which both sides violate the status quo both parties will return to a steady state if they engage in tit-for-tat strategies, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their work on",
    "prospect theory provide a possible answer to why states are unlikely to violate the status quo in the first place. Deterrence by threat of punishment and denial both establish reference points at which actors are incentivized to be risk seeking. For denial in cyberspace, after a certain point, adversaries gain benefit with little consequence. By contrast deterrence by punishment in cyberspace provides a wide range in which gains can be achieved with a limited likelihood of costs.\n\nTo illustrate this, I turn to a thought experiment in which each strategy of deterrence is emphasized in isolation from the other two. A) In a purely deterrence by denial framework a bank robber has much to dissuade him robbing a bank. There are security systems, vaults, armed guards, camera's and more, yet once the robber is able to overcome these characteristic traits of deterrence by denial he has access to all the money in the bank without any further consequences to his actions. B) In a deterrence by threat of punishment framework, because states do not consider additive, but rather discrete events in their threat calculus, the same bank robber can steal anything below 50% of the money in the bank and not have to worry about guards, cameras and vaults. The robber has an incentive to steal 49.999% of the money in the bank and not to cross 50% mark. Both situations encourage the bank robber to seek risk, but at different points. Working in tandem, denial and punishment strategies result in a sweet spot in which the bank robber is able achieve gains absent meaningful costs that might dissuade him.\n\nSimilarly, a state sponsored hacker, once through the defenses of a target and utilizing proper operational security can achieve the status of advanced persistent threat. This status allows the hacker to have relatively unfettered access to their target. In many instances this same hacker can actually cause the target systems to behave in ways not intended. Moving beyond espionage activities to those constitutive of offensive cyber operations to achieve effects. Generally, so long as these effects do not cross a threshold that that triggers retaliation or punishment, they can presumably achieve benefits with limited prospect of additional costs.\n\nC). By contrast entanglement encourages the bank robber to place some or much of his own money in the bank. Moreover, it encourages him to have his family, friends and colleagues all put their money in the bank also. If he still robs the bank he is robbing both from himself and from those whom he cares about. While he might benefit in the short term, his lost relationships with family, friends and colleagues as well as the fact that he stole part of the money from himself all serve to limit his risk seeking behavior and encourage him to be risk averse. Moreover, if someone impersonates him and steals money from the bank and the manager, thinking it was him subsequently freezes his accounts, he has an incentive to clear his name by finding the true perpetrator.\n\nCarrying this example over to the hacker, while the hacker is able to penetrate and achieve benefits in the short-term, the hacker is also fostering",
    "long-term losses. The challenge is that whereas in the bank robber incident the losses appear concrete, in the case of the hacker, the losses are harder to calculate.\n\nAll three strategies are intent on keeping the money in the bank secure. And very frequently all three work in tandem. Yet, the first two work at the low or high ends of the spectrum. Whereas entanglement works across the entire spectrum. Assuming China is the bank robber and the bank is intellectual property, there is little to dissuade China from theft. China's technical capacity makes denial an ineffective strategy, and its repeated small thefts never exceed in any one instance the 50% threshold therefore obviating threats of punishment. The question then becomes, is it possible to change China's perspective to see itself as stealing from its own pockets.\n\nWhat Kahneman and Tversky establish is that changing the reference point of actors can substantially impact the way in which they perceive gains and losses or costs and benefits. The objective of entanglement is to move potential adversaries from positions that are risk seeking to those that are risk averse. Writing on the topic of deterrence and prospect theory Jeffery Berejikian states: “deterrence is more likely to be effective when both states are in a gains frame, and less likely to be effective when either or both are in a losses frame.” He goes on to further state: “Under gains, a state will not risk disturbing the status quo even if the expected value of defection is greater than continued cooperation, so long as there is also some smaller probability of loss”. Below are two examples that emphasize the potential gains an adversary might hope to achieve through engaging in an attack. I deliberately focus on adversary behavior within the gains frame rather than losses because entanglements that induce losses should not be sought due to their mutual inefficiencies and propensity to foster risk seeking behaviors. Although the framework can be applied from both gains and losses perspectives to achieve risk aversion or risk seeking. Example 1 illustrates the framing of deterrence such that it creates a gains frame. Example 1 below has a small probability of loss (5%) indicating an attacker violating the status quo will benefit 95 out of 100 times. However, the framing of the reference point is such that the potential attacker is risk averse. And the declining marginal utility of an extra 501 USD does not outweigh, under the conditions of risk, the unlikely potential of losing 9,499. USD\n\nExample 1: Attacker has 95% Chance of Winning 10,000 USD or a 100% chance of winning 9,499 (Status Quo)\n\nAttacker Choice: Status Quo\n\nFigure 3 illustrates that the perceived value of potential gains falls below the value of a 100% probability or sure thing in gains. Because the sure bet is perceived to be of greater value than the gamble, the adversary does not seek out an additional set of gains because she fears the possibility of getting lower than what is expected.",
    "#\n\nA. F. BRANTLY\n\nExample 1 contrasts with example 2 in which the potential benefit and marginal utility of an additional 501 USD does not outweigh the potential loss of 9,499. USD By contrast, example 2 encourages risk seeking behavior in which the utility of gaining 9,499 USD substantially outweighs the potential of winning a sure 501. USD Although the probability is very low that an attacker will gain the additional 9,499 USD the attacker rejects the favorable status quo of 501 USD in exchange for the potential gains.\n\nExample 2: Attacker has  $5\\%$  Chance of winning 10,000 or a  $100\\%$  chance of winning 501. USD (Status Quo)\n\nAttacker Choice: Violation of Status Quo\n\nContrasting Figures 3 to 4 above places the perceived value of the payout above that of the  $100\\%$  probability or sure bet and therefore the adversary is likely to engage in risk seeking behavior because it perceives greater benefits from the risk.\n\nA defender leveraging entanglement could highlight the high probability of status quo maintenance and extend the shadow of the future outward for both attacker and defender. Although there are likely to be targets within a state that elevate the perceived value of a payout beyond that of the sure thing such that it alters the perception of an attacker from a high probability to a low probability function. In a single iteration game, it would be nearly impossible to\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk aversion).",
    "DEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n\n#\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 4. Decision-making under risk from a gains frame (risk seeking).\n\nprevent risk seeking behavior. Leveraging entanglement between two parties makes it possible to convey compounding probabilities and compounding losses. Thus, while the perception in Figure 4 is that the sure bet gains are modest and do not outweigh those gains potentially achieved via a one iteration game, leveraging the tit-for-tat methods of Axelrod, a defender can begin signaling that over time that benefits of a  $100\\%$  probability accrued longitudinally outweighs the likely value of one off attacks. This signaling is designed to lower the perceived payout value. For instance, a revised, but lowered, status quo over time can overcome some one-off benefit gains with low probabilities of success.\n\nFor example, a person who places 100 USD from their monthly paycheck into an account with a  $5.3\\%$  return would have 87,999 USD invested within 30 years. The same person who spends 100 USD a month on a lottery ticket has a 0.000000005714286% chance of winning the lottery in any given month. Yet the probabilities are calculated independently on each draw. This means that each month the individual has no greater chance of winning the lottery than the first month. While they might win a jackpot worth tens of millions of dollars, the likelihood of them doing so is low and their decision to gamble forgoes 51,999 USD in accrued interest plus a savings of 36,000. USD The key",
    "is to elevate both the value of the 100% probability relative to the perceived value of a payout both in the short term and over time.\n\nIn the case of an introduced firmware vulnerability by an attacker state, that state might win a short term gain worth hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property or intelligence value but might conversely lose tens of billions in market sales once discovered as was the case of Lenovo in 2006, when it was believed that it was introducing vulnerabilities into computer systems that were being sold to the United States government. Despite being later found to be an inaccurate rumor, the suspicion of violations was extremely damaging. Similarly, perceptions of state Chinese state penetrations of Huawei have severely constrained is market reach in many nations causing it lose out on billions of dollars in potential sales. Finally, another case in 2018 in which Super Micro was accused of manipulating its manufacturing for theft was similarly found to be erroneous, yet resulted substantial market implications. These are but three of the many potential examples in which short term risk seeking behavior likely resulted in long-term economic losses that could have been avoided should the parties involved been oriented toward a gains frame.\n\n## How to entangle friends and adversaries\n\nHaving established the potential for entanglement to shift the reference point of actors it is equally necessary explain how to entangle adversaries. Below are six conditions within which entanglement can be developed and understood to foster risk averse behavior within cyberspace interactions. First, unlike in the bank example, entanglement is unlikely to work at the individual level. Cyberspace's complexity and technical structure make it difficult to implement entanglement at the lowest levels of the spectrum. Entanglement works well within closely managed networked environments with high levels of network monitoring. Such environments dissuade certain types of behavior including viewing pornography, downloading copyrighted materials or other malfeasant behavior or result in increased hygiene. Closely monitored network environments include universities, the U.S. federal government and some corporations. Beyond high accountability organizational structures, the breadth and depth of cyberspace makes entanglement at the individual level impractical. The impracticality of the entanglement of individuals leaves wide open the space for deterrence by denial at the lowest levels. Similarly, it is unlikely to work for small groups or organizations including terrorist organizations, better deterred with denial strategies or other forms of complex deterrence.\n\nSecond, entangling military or intelligence aspects of national security within states beyond deep alliances such as the Five-Eyes and NATO is less likely although not impossible. States party to the Five-Eyes and NATO have deep, longstanding relationships fostering synergistic and mutually",
    "reinforcing capabilities based on established treaties or mutual defense needs. These structures foster cooperation and can help to mitigate tensions in times of crisis. Moreover, interdependencies within military and intelligence aspects of national security can and do bolster entanglement with nonaligned nations as they emphasize the potential capabilities able to be brought to bear in analyzing violations within other sectors.^{41} For example, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 led to the creation of the Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn^{42} and the utilization of mutual cyber capabilities to identify and threaten punishment. Another more directly relevant structure that indicates efforts to entangle and extend beyond simple collective defense promises is the creation of the NATO Cyber Operations Center (CyOC) in Brussels.^{43} These entanglements are both diplomatic and functional in nature and allow for shared resources and capabilities under specific conditions. The goal is not to deter the partner nations, but rather to build robust cooperative structures that increase detection of violations by third party nations and create shared understandings of the operational environment.\n\nEntanglement need not only include adversaries. Entanglements within one grouping of nations in cyberspace can serve to enforce compliance within other groupings. Combined resources limit the ability to hide an attack. Although nations are unlikely to entangle within military and intelligence cyberspace sectors across all nations, clusters of entanglements can enforce norms by making it known that violations more difficult to hide from collective groupings of states. While China and the United States are unlikely to want to entangle military and intelligence capabilities in cyberspace, the ties United States maintains with NATO and the Five Eyes enhance the monitoring of potential violations. Should China also create similar deep military alliances it could leverage the informational advantages achieved to similarly prevent violations by the United States or other nations. While entanglement in military and intelligence spheres is unlikely to be universal, we should expect to see pockets of development within historically aligned nations.\n\nThird, entanglement is unlikely to function in non-iterative interactions. In particular where zero-sum politics is dominant states fall into conventional realist tendencies.^{44} As the literature on complex interdependence indicates and is so often reiterated in the counter arguments to complex interdependence, in situations where there are zero-sum interactions entanglement is unlikely to function.^{45} Thus one key aspect of entanglement in cyberspace is the iterated interactions of states. This indicates that continued interstate dialogue is important for fostering entanglement. If interactions are viewed as non-iterative then there is little to keep states from defecting. It is through the creation and maintenance of iterative interactions with other states that entanglement becomes viable.",
    "Fourth, increases in technological interdependence through the creation of heterogenous markets will foster entanglement. By allowing the sale of goods and services across markets within sectors outside of the military and intelligence infrastructures of states, the future prospects of economic gains and market growth encourage states to maintain the status quo. Heterogeneity should necessarily include hardware and software markets. The increased heterogeneity of markets establishes a reference point within a gains frame and dissuades states from defecting. Heterogeneity not only increases entanglement; it fosters systemic resilience.^{46} It does this by increasing the variety of potential targets available thereby lowering the value of any one target. A single exploit usable against dozens of computer systems all running the same operating system is substantially more impactful than that same exploit only usable against a fraction same number due to heterogeneous operating systems.\n\nHeterogeneous markets also provide an inducement to foster iterative interactions.^{47} By incorporating and expanding the diversity of products used within an ecosystem the markets can seek efficiency within managed and rules-based structures. The introduction of diversity within a market absent rules protecting intellectual property or prohibiting state subsidies for non-national security related goods and services would result in homogenous outcomes in which those states engaged in noncompetitive or illegal practices would find themselves with a comparative advantage of their competitors. To respond to unfair practices states should institute the tit-for-tat methods indicated by Axelrod and seek to move back toward equilibrium. Such behaviors might require states to adapt national laws or policies to in a timely manner to provide an effective means of fostering stability over the long term. Nor should policies and laws implemented in response to defections be permanent, but rather should be instituted with the objective or returning to manageable and mutually beneficial status quo. The process of fostering heterogeneity within markets must be managed between two extremes. The objective therefore centers on stability and efficiency. Heterogeneity fosters market diversification and creates competitive opportunities across and within nations. The benefits accrued are not universal, but can be sufficient to foster or enhance stability.\n\nFifth, increases in economic interdependence through shared market interactions, manufacturing, research and development and education can be leveraged to extend and link cyberspace interactions to the benefits accrued via other non-cyber sectors further extends out the iterative relationship of parties entangled. It is increasingly difficult to separate technological markets from non-technological markets. Therefore, inherent relationships between the two should be obvious to the parties involved. Whether theft (espionage) or attacks occur in cyberspace or in physical spaces both are to be discouraged as they constrain the shadow of the future. Entangling adversaries requires",
    "signaling that espionage,^{48} theft or attacks in cyberspace are the equivalent as those in a physical space and will similarly result in potential losses that would damage iterative gains.\n\nThe deeper the economic interdependence of states within conventional interactions the more likely they are to have a foundation upon which to build interdependence within cyberspace. These interactions can be tied to one another to foster mutually beneficial behaviors and norms. While there are likely to be defections, the process of quickly, and proportionately addressing these defections through corresponding defections is likely to moderate over time and return to a mutually acceptable equilibrium point.\n\nSixth, entanglement in cyberspace is not only intergovernmental but also sectoral. Sectoral improvements in information sharing within various industries to include critical infrastructures is likely to impact national level decision-making. Organizations such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services -- Information Sharing and Analysis Center) or E-ISAC (Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center) -- building deepened relationships amongst financial and energy entities in other countries is likely to identify and foster solutions more rapidly to threats. Moreover, transnational ISACs are likely to reduce the incentive for violation as they provide reinforcing benefits to participants over time. By linking sub-national organizations internationally, they become advocates for continued relationships between the national level governments. Building trust within these organizations is likely to be time-consuming, but can, over time, facilitate sectoral and cross-sectors entanglement and resilience.\n\nBy building organizational structures at the sub-state level that share information, coordinate and cooperate to mitigate problems, threats can be identified more readily and addressed outside of state to state interactions. Within ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) formally or informally constructed, best practices and the benefits associated with cooperation enable gains across participating entities.^{49} If one entity is found to have defected by violating organizational norms it can be excluded from the benefits it has received and therefore might become relatively less resilient to future violations in cyberspace than if it had maintained its good standing. As such there should also be confidence building measures that facilitate the reentry of parties that defected in the past back into organizational structures. Moreover, such organizations must necessarily account for the lack of incentives to fully address problems of free-riding.^{50} Organizational structures are not a silver bullet but rather yet another tool in facilitating entanglement.\n\nThese six conditions are not all-inclusive and numerous other potential options for the entanglement of states are potentially possible. Developing ways to draw states together to seek the benefits of interactions over an iterated timeline fosters an environment that becomes increasingly secure.",
    "Entanglement encourages cooperation and disincentivizes defection. Intellectually, the processes of developing entanglement mechanisms are likely to be substantially more difficult than deterrence by threats of punishment or denial. The difficulty resides in the need to more thoroughly understand adversaries and allies' motivations and to seek out means to generate gains frames.\n\n## The entanglement zone\n\nEntanglement shifts the present emphasis from the imposition of costs that establish a reference point for potential adversaries that is risk seeking, to one that builds mutual benefits and discourages defections. Using entanglement to focus on the establishment and recognition as well as perception management of benefits both in the present and over time builds complex circumstances that challenge adversaries to reevaluate the costs and benefits of their actions. By shifting the focus away from punishment and denial, entanglement seeks to alter the reference point from risk seeking behaviors commonly found within conventional deterrence modeling to risk aversion. Entanglement both alters the calculus of states interactions and extends out the shadow of the future. Building ties through information sharing and analysis centers within critical sectors such as finance and energy, the development of heterogeneous and diverse markets inclusive of software and hardware from diverse ecosystems, the establishment of global supply chains, and the broadening and deepening of ties with key strategic allies all coalesce to entangle potential adversaries. Moreover, as entanglement deepens so too does risk aversion related to the potential loss of sure gains over time.\n\nEntanglement between conventional allies further raises the costs for non-allied interventions as it creates systemic hands tying behaviors across countries and sectors. It also discourages allies from defecting from existing relationships for fear of losing the benefits of entanglement. Moreover, entanglement with traditional or potential adversaries serves as a self-deterrent mechanism that promotes risk aversion. For example: because China benefits from US and European markets it is dissuaded from harming them with cyber-attacks that degrade/deny, destroy or disrupt or in any way damage their existing benefits both in the short and the long-term. If further entangled, China might also be willing to provide information to enhance resilience or counter threats by third parties that might adversely impact its own benefits. By more thoroughly entangling both friend and foe the aggregate benefits for maintaining and enhancing good behavior within the cyberspace increase and reinforce risk averse behaviors.^{51}\n\nFurther examination of the Chinese case illustrates the potential value associated the alteration of a reference point. The Obama administration, knowing that the U.S. and Chinese economies were deeply interwoven,",
    "leveraged a 10-year history of malfeasant behavior by the Chinese that transpired largely in the absence of substantial changes in the status quo. In 2015 the Obama administration threatened to impose sanctions on the Chinese that would have reduced the prospects of future trade.^{52} Although the threat of sanctions indicates a potential punishment, the threat of punishment as described by defense official implies that the objective is to signal a reduction in the net gains associated with the mutual relationship. One defense official put the entangled nature of the relationship and the threat of sanctions into perspectives when quoted as saying: “Done in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship.”^{53} Absent a positive and economically fruitful relationship the sanctions would have been an example of deterrence by punishment, in much the same way as sanctions against Iran, or North Korea are. However, the interwoven nature of the economies resulting in an economic relationship entangled the states in such a way that made changes in that relationship undesirable.\n\nThe combined threat of sanctions and criminological measures such as indictments against Chinese nationals implicated in espionage activities and demonstrated the capacity to identify malfeasance.^{54} The moves by the Obama administration established that the U.S. had drawn a line in the sand that as clearly as possible identified what a mutually beneficial relationship could be and how the Chinese were in violation of that relationship. The signal was clear, Chinese risk seeking behaviors including cyber espionage activities threatened to upend its economic benefits. The result was a reframing of Chinese perception toward a more risk averse position. In 2016 Cybersecurity firm FireEye identified as a substantive impact of US-Chinese discussions on the relationship on the volume and severity incidents of Chinese cyber-attacks and espionage behavior against the United States. The act of signaling, combined with the ability to clearly identify perpetrators of violations threatened losses in excess of potential gains and changed the reference point between the two states. The alteration of the reference point was not permanent. Recent developments in the U.S. -- China trade relationship highlight the fragility of entanglement and have resulted in a substantial uptick in the number of malicious cyber activities undertaken by the Chinese.^{55} The recent reversion of China to less desirable behavior indicates the difficulties and the need for the constant cultivation entanglement for it to be a successful strategy.\n\nEntanglement starts with building upon relationships at multiple different levels and finding those areas where mutual cooperation is possible or already exists. An example of cooperation that further entangles states includes the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime in which 57 parties (61 signatories) sought to harmonize laws and enhance cooperation between states. Creating organizational or legal structures that foster procedural changes in the way in which",
    "states interpret or cooperate within mutually beneficial sectors can serve as a starting point for further entanglement. Other examples include the harmonization of NATO standards, training, fiscal allocations, and strategies in cyberspace via the 2016 Cyber Defense Pledge. By extending out the time horizon and highlighting the benefits associated with the maintenance or improvement of the status quo in an environment with minimal defections deepens entanglement.\n\nYet despite all benefits of entanglement there are limitations. Not all states can be entangled. States such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are difficult to entangle directly. However, via proxy entanglements with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) even states as isolated as the DPRK, have potential points upon which to build entanglements. The process of entangling is not immediate, nor is it all encompassing. As has been noted within the various debates on relative versus absolute gains, there remain issues which are core to the interests of certain states that supersede the prospects associated with entanglement.\n\nWithin international politics there are conditions which induce zero-sum relations between states. In instances, where core national security concerns arise, the realist model of interactions to include situations non-iterative prisoner's dilemma or chicken may arise. Zero-sum interactions change how costs and benefits are framed over time and make it difficult for entanglement to outweigh individual defections. Such interactions are unable to consider iterative games and are likely unable to link competing issue areas that might foster entanglement. Russian behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other states along its periphery illustrate the challenge associated with overcoming zero-sum interactions in favor of iterative interactions likely to result in absolute gains for all involved parties.\n\nFor the Russian Federation the induction of states along its periphery into NATO has given rise to a zero-sum mentality that reduces the prospects of mutual cooperation between parties and raises the possibility of defections. Similarly, because the states in which it has engaged militarily and via cyber means are weak, their ability to extend a zero-sum game into an iterative games format is limited absent international assistance, which, with the exception of Estonia has been largely lacking. This indicates a fundamental challenge posed to entanglement left unexamined. The ability to reframe is partially a function of the ability of the states involved in entanglement to demonstrate the prospect for losses such that risk aversion rather than risk seeking behavior should be the frame for reference for both states involved. Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova are unable to present a compelling case that nonintervention is more beneficial than intervention. Nor are any of these states able to force Russia into a tit-for-tat game due to a substantial asymmetry in their relative power. Estonia alone, through its participation in NATO can establish with international assistance the means to signal an iterative framework that portends potential losses based on",
    "alterations of the status quo. As an example, the creation of the CCDCOE in Tallinn following Russian cyber-attacks while not a direct assault on Russia signals resolve and provides a response to Russian behaviors that enhances capabilities and cooperation within NATO.\n\nIn addition to instances of state power imbalances, interactions occurring at the individual or small to medium group level fall below the level at which entanglement interactions likely impact the risk framing behavior of this category of actors. It is not possible to entangle via organizational structures or the reframing of interactions as iterative non-state actor groups such as terrorist organizations. These organizations cannot be incentivized to cooperate over the long-term in a way that emphasizes the potential gains to be had. This is both a function of their goals and the goals and objectives of the state seeking to deter them. Both are mutually incompatible for the creation and development of entanglements. One party that seeks the complete destruction or overthrow of another cannot be reasoned with in a manner that sufficiently reframes risk perceptions. For these actor categories, the best mechanisms for deterrence reside outside of entanglement in efforts to deny and threats of punishment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEntanglement as a strategy is not the sole solution to the problem of deterrence within the cyber domain. Yet, in tandem with multiple other complimentary strategies emphasizing denial and threats of punishment, entanglement has the potential to impact the future status quo within cyberspace. What has become abundantly clear over the duration of the last 30 years is that threats of punishment and the development of defenses that deny adversaries access have been unsuccessful at achieving a stable status quo acceptable to all parties.^{60} Problems associated with the calibration of punishment for cyber-attacks, the attribution of attackers, the ability to hold adversary assets at risk of punishment and more have plagued the ability to deter cyber-attacks via threats of punishment. Similarly, the increasing costs associated with the development of ever more robust defenses to deny adversary access to systems and networks has proven an unwinnable cat and mouse game. While both denial and punishment have a role to play in deterring cyber-attacks they work best at their respective ends of the spectrum.\n\nIt is into the gap between the two poles that entanglement provides a partial remedy in some but not all cases. When states are able to more deeply entangle one another, to demonstrate the ability to engage in tit-for-tat behaviors and to force an equilibrium that is beneficial to both parties it is conceivable that they are also able to also shift the framing of risk from one of risk seeking to risk aversion. Yet, entanglement is not a static form of deterrence and requires constant efforts from all parties involved to balance",
    "the concerns and needs of each. When the balance of such needs tilts the equilibrium away from continued iterative absolute gains to a more zero-sum interaction, entanglement will fail. Although it is susceptible to failure it is also possible that entanglement can improve the current status quo and reduce the number of instances of failure. If it is able to accomplish these two objectives, then adding entanglement to a diversified and dynamic deterrence portfolio is worthy of consideration.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

    "abstract": "Conventional models of deterrence focus on the ability to deter adversaries through ex-ante threats that impose ex-post costs or through the elevation of ex-ante costs through strategies that deny. The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is complex and the establishment of deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions, entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions in cyberspace and works toward building mutual interdependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.",
