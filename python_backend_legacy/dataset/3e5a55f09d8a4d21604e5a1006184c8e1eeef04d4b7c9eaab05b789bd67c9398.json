Introduction\n\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\n\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity.¹ For such\n\n¹ Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n\n621",

While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force,² hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force.³ Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.⁴\n\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues⁵ that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\n\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n\n2 Benatar, 2009, The Use of Cyber Force: Need for Legal Justification? 1 Goettingen Journal of International Law 375, 389; Woltag, 2010, Cyber Warfare, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford, at para. 8.\n\n3 Schmitt, op. cit., 1999, 913, Roscini, op. cit., 106; Woltag, op. cit., para. 8; Waxman, op. cit., 431 et seq.; Joyner/Lotrionte, 2001, Information Warfare as International Coercion: Elements of a Legal Framework, 12 European Journal of International Law 825, 863, Keber/Roguski, 2011, Jus ad bellum electronicum?

Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures.⁶ However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\n\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’.⁷ The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\n\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’⁸ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n\n⁶ Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n\n⁷ Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n\n⁸ International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.",

Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt.¹⁰ While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general,¹¹ as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’.¹² This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’¹³ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be.¹⁴ The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence.¹⁵ Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.¹⁶\n\n⁹ O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n\n¹⁰ Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n\n¹¹ Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n\n¹² The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments.¹⁷ Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic,¹⁸ ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’¹⁹ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour.²⁰ Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure.²¹ The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks.²² Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’²³ or ‘entry-point anonymity’;²⁴ the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\n\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n\n¹⁷ Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n\n¹⁸ Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n\n¹⁹ Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n\n²⁰ Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n\n²¹ Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n\n²² Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n\n²³ Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n\n²⁴ Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n\n625",

In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n\n25 Mandiant, APT1 – Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, Mandiant, 2013, available at: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf; Minnick, China Cyberwarfare Evidence Now Undeniable – Mandiant, Intercepts, The Official Blog of Defense News International, 19 February 2013, available at: http://blogs.defensenews.com/intercepts/2013/02/china-cyberwarfare-evidence-now-undeniable-mandiant/; Sanger, Barboza, Perlroth, 2003, Chinese Army Unit Is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S., New York Times, 19 Feb, p.

Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.⁴³\n\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\n\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n\n## 3.

Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\n\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n\n44 Alland, 2010, The Definition of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force.

Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\n\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’.

Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited,⁶⁸ which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’⁶⁹ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ.⁷⁰ The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’,⁷¹ thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\n\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\n\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\n\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\n\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n\n75 But see O’Connell, 2012, op cit., 205, who expressly envisages a different role for countermeasures in the cyber security context.\n\n76 Tallinn Manual, op cit., Glossary of Technical Terms, 257.\n\n77 Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n\n78 Hathaway, op. cit., 858.\n\n79 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (United States of America v France), 9 December 1978, 18 RIAA 416.\n\n80 ILC Commentaries, Part Three, Chapter II, at para. 5.\n\n81 See para. 2.2.\n\n82 Hinkle, op. cit., 18 et seq.\n\n633",

Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’.⁸⁶ As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\n\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory.⁸⁷ In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n\n⁸³ Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n\n⁸⁴ Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n\n⁸⁵ *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n\n⁸⁶ Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96]\n\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n\n88 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 101.\n\n89 Most notably ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22; ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, at para. 29.\n\n90 ICJ, Pulp Mills, at para. 101.\n\n91 Ibid.\n\n92 Trail Smelter case (United States of America v Canada), 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, 3 RIAA 1905.\n\n93 ICJ, Corfu Channel, 22.\n\n94 Heathcote, 2012, State Omissions and Due Diligence: Aspects of Fault, Damage and Contribution to Injury in the Law of State Responsibility, in Heathcote et al.

As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\n\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n\n97 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n\n98 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n\n99 ICJ, Case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\n\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources.

Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\n\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\n\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n\n110 See Ziolkowski, 2012, op cit., 306.\n\n111 See e.g. Markoff et al., 2010, In Digital Combat, U.S. Finds No Easy Deterrent, The New York Times, [online] 25 Jan, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/26cyber.html, about a cyber attack simulation carried out by the U.S. Department of Defense: ‘No one could pinpoint the country from which the attack came.’\n\n112 See the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James R.

In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\n\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\n\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121]\n\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n\n116 Deeks, 2012, ‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense, 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483; Schmitt, 2003, Preemptive Strategies in International Law, 24 Michigan Journal of International Law 513, 541 et seq.; Tallinn Manual, Rule 13, para. 22 et seq.\n117 Sklerov, op. cit., 13 and 38 et seq.\n118 In this sense Schmitt, Preemptive Strategies, 541 et seq.; the Tallinn Manual’s position on this matter is ambiguous.\n119 For a comparison of both lines of argumentation see Tams, 2009, op cit., 384 et seq.\n120 See Deeks, op. cit., 546.\n121 Tams, 2009, op. cit., 385.\n\n639",

This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack.¹²² This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures,¹²³ it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.¹²⁴\n\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code,¹²⁵ endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’,¹²⁶ ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’.¹²⁷ However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum.¹²⁸ Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n\n¹²² Ibid, 388.\n\n¹²³ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n\n¹²⁴ Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n\n¹²⁵ Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n\n¹²⁶ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n\n¹²⁷ Ibid., at para. 5.\n\n¹²⁸ Elagab, op cit., 113.",

Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important.¹³⁰ In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights,¹³¹ which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’,¹³² and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.¹³³\n\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures.¹³⁴ Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended.¹³⁵ Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible.¹³⁶ Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle,¹³⁷ at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country.

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139]\n\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\n\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n\n138 Caltagirone/Frinkke, *op. cit.*, 263.\n\n139 Such a prospective tactic might even be likened to the use of so-called ‘human shields’ in armed conflicts; see e.g. Gross, 2002, Use of Civilians as Human Shields: What Legal and Moral Restrictions Pertain to a War Waged by a Democratic State Against Terrorism?, *Emory International Law Review*, 445.\n\n140 ILC Articles, Commentaries, Part Three Chapter II, at 5.\n\n141 Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 20.\n\n142 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (*United States of America v.

At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’,¹⁴⁷ or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’¹⁴⁸ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’.¹⁴⁹ However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\n\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’¹⁵⁰ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\n\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue.

Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\n\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n\n## 3.2 Necessity\n\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\n\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n\n644",

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine.¹⁵⁵ The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment,¹⁵⁶ grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations,¹⁵⁷ and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack.¹⁵⁸ Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’,¹⁵⁹ virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts.¹⁶⁰ Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’.¹⁶¹ Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n\n¹⁵⁵ Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166]\n\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to",

With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’,¹⁷² meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’.¹⁷³ Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’.¹⁷⁴ As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment.¹⁷⁵ Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care,¹⁷⁶ which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\n\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n\n¹⁷⁰ Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n\n¹⁷¹ ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n\n¹⁷² Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n\n¹⁷³ Ibid., at para. 6.\n\n¹⁷⁴ Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n\n¹⁷⁵ Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n\n¹⁷⁶ Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.",

The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\n\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\n\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n\n177 See e.g. ICJ, Wall advisory opinion, at para. 140; ITLOS, The M/V 'Saiga' (No. 2) Case (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v.

Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\n\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter.

While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\n\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties,¹⁸⁸ or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*.

In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\n\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’.²⁰¹ Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States,²⁰² required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’.²⁰³ Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred.²⁰⁴ Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.²⁰⁵\n\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\n\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.²⁰⁶\n\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n\n200 See most significantly UN GA Res. 49/60 (9 December 1994); UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000); UN SC Res. 1368 (12 September 2001); UN SC Res. 1373 (28 September 2001).\n\n201 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n\n202 Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, CET 185, signed 23 November 2001, effective 1 July 2004.\n\n203 Sklerov, op. cit., note 382 and accompanying text; see Convention on Cybercrime, Chapter II, Section 1, Articles 2 to 13.\n\n204 Sklerov, op. cit., 12; Kulesza, 2009, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security, 29 Polish Yearbook of International Law 139, 141.\n\n205 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n\n206 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v.

In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\n\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n\n207 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 27.\n\n208 ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, at 22: '[...] the laying of the minefield [...] could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government'.\n\n209 Ibid., at 20.\n\n210 See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue by UN Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue A/HRC/23/40, 17 April 2013.\n\n211 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 28.\n\n212 See generally Schröder, 2012, Precautionary Approach/Principle, in Wolfrum (ed.), The Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford University Press.\n\n213 ITLOS, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, at paras. 132-135.\n\n214 Krieger, op. cit., 19.\n\n215 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v.

In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident.²¹⁸ As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident.²¹⁹ This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n\n216 Krieger, op. cit., 19; for the corresponding aspect in relation to environmental law and precaution see Foster, 2011, Science and the Precautionary Principle in International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge, p. 35: ‘[...] working towards achieving the right balance between development and environmental protection has in general required the international community to focus on international cooperation rather than on State responsibility’.\n\n217 European Union, EU Cybersecurity Plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity, press release IP/13/94, 7 February 2013, available at: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm; for Germany, Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit informationstechnischer Systeme, 7 March 2013, available at: http://bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/Entwuerfe/Entwurf_it-sicherheitsgesetz.html; the latter proposition by the Federal Ministry of the Interior however has met fierce opposition on the part of the concerned enterprises, see Cyberangriffe: Hacker-Meldepflicht für Unternehmen offenbar vor dem Aus, Spiegel [online], 5 June 2013, available at: http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/hacker-meldepflicht-fuer-unternehmen-offenbar-vor-dem-aus-a-903824.html.\n\n218 Kulesza, op. cit., 149.\n\n219 In this sense it might be said that, in 2007, Russia violated its due diligence obligation towards Estonia when it failed to cooperate to mitigate or obstruct the ongoing DDoS attacks emanating from its territory despite formal requests by Estonian authorities; see Evron, 2008, Battling Botnets and Online Mobs, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 121, 124.\n\n656",

At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight,²²⁰ unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\n\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n\n²²⁰ See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity.¹ For such\n¹ Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n621\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nacts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force,² hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force.³ Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.⁴\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues⁵ that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n2 Benatar, 2009, The Use of Cyber Force: Need for Legal Justification? 1 Goettingen Journal of International Law 375, 389; Woltag, 2010, Cyber Warfare, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford, at para. 8.\n3 Schmitt, op. cit., 1999, 913, Roscini, op. cit., 106; Woltag, op. cit., para. 8; Waxman, op. cit., 431 et seq.; Joyner/Lotrionte, 2001, Information Warfare as International Coercion: Elements of a Legal Framework, 12 European Journal of International Law 825, 863, Keber/Roguski, 2011, Jus ad bellum electronicum?

Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures.⁶ However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’.⁷ The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’⁸ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n⁶ Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n⁷ Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n⁸ International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nto establish a fact as given is less clear.⁹ Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt.¹⁰ While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general,¹¹ as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’.¹² This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’¹³ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be.¹⁴ The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence.¹⁵ Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.¹⁶\n⁹ O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n¹⁰ Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n¹¹ Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n¹² The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments.¹⁷ Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic,¹⁸ ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’¹⁹ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour.²⁰ Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure.²¹ The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks.²² Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’²³ or ‘entry-point anonymity’;²⁴ the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n¹⁷ Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n¹⁸ Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n¹⁹ Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n²⁰ Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n²¹ Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n²² Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n²³ Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n²⁴ Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n625\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nestablished. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n25 Mandiant, APT1 – Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, Mandiant, 2013, available at: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf; Minnick, China Cyberwarfare Evidence Now Undeniable – Mandiant, Intercepts, The Official Blog of Defense News International, 19 February 2013, available at: http://blogs.defensenews.com/intercepts/2013/02/china-cyberwarfare-evidence-now-undeniable-mandiant/; Sanger, Barboza, Perlroth, 2003, Chinese Army Unit Is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S., New York Times, 19 Feb, p.

With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, $^{33}$  it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. $^{34}$  In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded\nThe looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion $^{35}$  that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' $^{36}$  to 'overall control' $^{37}$  does not touch upon the issue of identification. $^{38}$  Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, $^{39}$  or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', $^{40}$  can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, $^{41}$  and it is\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbeyond any doubt that international law requires attribution.⁴² Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.⁴³\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity\n## 3.1 Countermeasures\n## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures\nThe first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in\n⁴² Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n⁴³ Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n628\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nconformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n44 Alland, 2010, The Definition of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of\n50 ILC Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 1; traditionally, reprisals comprised ‘a perceived moral right to punish the responsible State’s delict’, Calamita, 2009, Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue, 42 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1393, 1420; see on this point critically Bederman, 2002, Counterintuiting Countermeasures, 96 *American Journal of International Law* 817, 822: ‘This change in emphasis on the nature and purpose of countermeasures likewise places in some doubt the Commission’s use of earlier international law sources.’\n51 Tallinn Manual, *op cit.*, at 37.\n52 Calamita, 2011, Countermeasures and Jurisdiction: Between Effectiveness and Fragmentation, 42 *Georgetown Journal of International Law* 233, 243.\n53 ILC Articles, Commentaries, Part Three Chapter II, at para. 5.\n54 *Ibid.*\n55 See in general Leben, *op cit.*, 1197 *et seq.*\n56 ICJ, *Oil Platforms*, Separate Opinion of Judge Simma, at para. 12.\n630\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthese acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n57 ICJ, Nicaragua, at para. 249.\n58 Gazzini, 2005, The Changing Rules on the Use of Force in International Law, Manchester, 169; Barsotti, 1986, Armed Reprisals, in Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force, Dordrecht, 81, 90 et seq.; Zimmermann, 2007, The Second Lebanon War: Jus ad Bellum, Jus in Bello and the Issue of Proportionality, 11 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 99, 104 et seq.\n59 Franck, 2002, Recourse to Force.

Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited,⁶⁸ which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’⁶⁹ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ.⁷⁰ The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’,⁷¹ thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.⁷²\n## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks\nWhen countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁷³ The same can be said about statements by State representatives.⁷⁴ What\n⁶⁷ Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n75 But see O’Connell, 2012, op cit., 205, who expressly envisages a different role for countermeasures in the cyber security context.\n76 Tallinn Manual, op cit., Glossary of Technical Terms, 257.\n77 Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n78 Hathaway, op. cit., 858.\n79 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (United States of America v France), 9 December 1978, 18 RIAA 416.\n80 ILC Commentaries, Part Three, Chapter II, at para. 5.\n81 See para. 2.2.\n82 Hinkle, op. cit., 18 et seq.\n633\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nsuch an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.⁸³ Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’,⁸⁴ which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’.⁸⁵ However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’.⁸⁶ As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory.⁸⁷ In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n⁸³ Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n⁸⁴ Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n⁸⁵ *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n⁸⁶ Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96]\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n88 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 101.\n89 Most notably ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22; ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, at para. 29.\n90 ICJ, Pulp Mills, at para. 101.\n91 Ibid.\n92 Trail Smelter case (United States of America v Canada), 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, 3 RIAA 1905.\n93 ICJ, Corfu Channel, 22.\n94 Heathcote, 2012, State Omissions and Due Diligence: Aspects of Fault, Damage and Contribution to Injury in the Law of State Responsibility, in Heathcote et al.

As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n97 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n98 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n99 ICJ, Case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources.

Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n110 See Ziolkowski, 2012, op cit., 306.\n111 See e.g. Markoff et al., 2010, In Digital Combat, U.S. Finds No Easy Deterrent, The New York Times, [online] 25 Jan, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/26cyber.html, about a cyber attack simulation carried out by the U.S. Department of Defense: ‘No one could pinpoint the country from which the attack came.’\n112 See the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James R.

In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121]\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n116 Deeks, 2012, ‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense, 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483; Schmitt, 2003, Preemptive Strategies in International Law, 24 Michigan Journal of International Law 513, 541 et seq.; Tallinn Manual, Rule 13, para. 22 et seq.\n117 Sklerov, op. cit., 13 and 38 et seq.\n118 In this sense Schmitt, Preemptive Strategies, 541 et seq.; the Tallinn Manual’s position on this matter is ambiguous.\n119 For a comparison of both lines of argumentation see Tams, 2009, op cit., 384 et seq.\n120 See Deeks, op. cit., 546.\n121 Tams, 2009, op. cit., 385.\n639\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack.¹²² This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures,¹²³ it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.¹²⁴\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code,¹²⁵ endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’,¹²⁶ ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’.¹²⁷ However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum.¹²⁸ Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n¹²² Ibid, 388.\n¹²³ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n¹²⁴ Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n¹²⁵ Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n¹²⁶ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., at para. 5.\n¹²⁸ Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\ntowards it.¹²⁹ The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important.¹³⁰ In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights,¹³¹ which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’,¹³² and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.¹³³\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures.¹³⁴ Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended.¹³⁵ Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible.¹³⁶ Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle,¹³⁷ at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b).

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139]\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n138 Caltagirone/Frinkke, *op. cit.*, 263.\n139 Such a prospective tactic might even be likened to the use of so-called ‘human shields’ in armed conflicts; see e.g. Gross, 2002, Use of Civilians as Human Shields: What Legal and Moral Restrictions Pertain to a War Waged by a Democratic State Against Terrorism?, *Emory International Law Review*, 445.\n140 ILC Articles, Commentaries, Part Three Chapter II, at 5.\n141 Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 20.\n142 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (*United States of America v.

At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’,¹⁴⁷ or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’¹⁴⁸ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’.¹⁴⁹ However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’¹⁵⁰ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with\n¹⁴⁵ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n¹⁴⁸ Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n¹⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n¹⁵⁰ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n643\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nits duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n644\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nNecessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^[151]^\nStill, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^[152]^ and occasionally still called into question,^[153]^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^[154]^ According to the text of the norm:\n[n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine.¹⁵⁵ The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment,¹⁵⁶ grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations,¹⁵⁷ and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack.¹⁵⁸ Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’,¹⁵⁹ virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts.¹⁶⁰ Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’.¹⁶¹ Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n¹⁵⁵ Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166]\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nthe fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’.¹⁷⁰ This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project.¹⁷¹ Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’,¹⁷² meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’.¹⁷³ Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’.¹⁷⁴ As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment.¹⁷⁵ Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care,¹⁷⁶ which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n¹⁷⁰ Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n¹⁷¹ ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n¹⁷² Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n¹⁷³ Ibid., at para. 6.\n¹⁷⁴ Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n¹⁷⁵ Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n¹⁷⁶ Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nIn any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n177 See e.g. ICJ, Wall advisory opinion, at para. 140; ITLOS, The M/V 'Saiga' (No. 2) Case (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v.

Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law,[185] which would mean that it would not\n180 Ibid., at para. 17.\n181 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 39.\n182 Ibid.\n183 See Definition of Aggression, GA/Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 December 1974.\n184 See already Ago, Eighth Report on State Responsibility.

While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties,¹⁸⁸ or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*.

The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n189 Wendel, 2007, State Responsibility for Interferences with the Freedom of Navigation in Public International Law, Heidelberg, at 49.\n190 See BBC News, On This Day: 1967: Supertanker Torrey Canyon hits rocks, available at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/18/newsid_4242000/4242709.stm.\n191 See Ago, Eighth Report on State Responsibility.

In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’.²⁰¹ Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States,²⁰² required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’.²⁰³ Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred.²⁰⁴ Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.²⁰⁵\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.²⁰⁶\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n200 See most significantly UN GA Res. 49/60 (9 December 1994); UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000); UN SC Res. 1368 (12 September 2001); UN SC Res. 1373 (28 September 2001).\n201 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n202 Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, CET 185, signed 23 November 2001, effective 1 July 2004.\n203 Sklerov, op. cit., note 382 and accompanying text; see Convention on Cybercrime, Chapter II, Section 1, Articles 2 to 13.\n204 Sklerov, op. cit., 12; Kulesza, 2009, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security, 29 Polish Yearbook of International Law 139, 141.\n205 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n206 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197.\n654\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n207 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 27.\n208 ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, at 22: '[...] the laying of the minefield [...] could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government'.\n209 Ibid., at 20.\n210 See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue by UN Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue A/HRC/23/40, 17 April 2013.\n211 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 28.\n212 See generally Schröder, 2012, Precautionary Approach/Principle, in Wolfrum (ed.), The Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford University Press.\n213 ITLOS, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, at paras. 132-135.\n214 Krieger, op. cit., 19.\n215 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, para. 223.\n655\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbreaches.²¹⁶ Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.²¹⁷\nIn the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident.²¹⁸ As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident.²¹⁹ This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n216 Krieger, op. cit., 19; for the corresponding aspect in relation to environmental law and precaution see Foster, 2011, Science and the Precautionary Principle in International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge, p. 35: ‘[...] working towards achieving the right balance between development and environmental protection has in general required the international community to focus on international cooperation rather than on State responsibility’.\n217 European Union, EU Cybersecurity Plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity, press release IP/13/94, 7 February 2013, available at: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm; for Germany, Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit informationstechnischer Systeme, 7 March 2013, available at: http://bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/Entwuerfe/Entwurf_it-sicherheitsgesetz.html; the latter proposition by the Federal Ministry of the Interior however has met fierce opposition on the part of the concerned enterprises, see Cyberangriffe: Hacker-Meldepflicht für Unternehmen offenbar vor dem Aus, Spiegel [online], 5 June 2013, available at: http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/hacker-meldepflicht-fuer-unternehmen-offenbar-vor-dem-aus-a-903824.html.\n218 Kulesza, op. cit., 149.\n219 In this sense it might be said that, in 2007, Russia violated its due diligence obligation towards Estonia when it failed to cooperate to mitigate or obstruct the ongoing DDoS attacks emanating from its territory despite formal requests by Estonian authorities; see Evron, 2008, Battling Botnets and Online Mobs, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 121, 124.\n656\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthreats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight,²²⁰ unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n²²⁰ See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.\n.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity. For such\n Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nacts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force, hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force. Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nno physical harm is done. Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures. However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’. The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nto establish a fact as given is less clear. Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt. While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general, as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’. This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be. The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence. Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.\n O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments. Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic, ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour. Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure. The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks. Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’ or ‘entry-point anonymity’; the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nestablished. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nsingle incident which prompted it. $^{32}$  While being a reasonable assertion on the face of it, this statement points to a dangerous development. With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, $^{33}$  it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. $^{34}$  In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded\nThe looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion $^{35}$  that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' $^{36}$  to 'overall control' $^{37}$  does not touch upon the issue of identification. $^{38}$  Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, $^{39}$  or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', $^{40}$  can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, $^{41}$  and it is\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbeyond any doubt that international law requires attribution. Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity\n## 3.1 Countermeasures\n## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures\nThe first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in\n Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nconformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nCountermeasures may not, therefore, be employed in order to punish the adversary.50 However, the commentary to Rule 9 of the Tallinn Manual notes that State practice is ambiguous in this regard, as States ‘sometimes appear to be motivated by punitive considerations when resorting to countermeasures’.51 In any case, to achieve the goal of restoration of compliance, the injured State is under no obligation to resort to means that ‘mirror the underlying wrongful act against which they are directed’.52 There might be good arguments in favour of a concept of reciprocity with regard to the necessity and proportionality requirements,53 but the ILC rightly observes that ‘a limitation to reciprocal countermeasures assumes that the injured State will be in a position to impose the same or related measures as the responsible State, which may not be so’.54 As explained below, this assessment is particularly relevant in the cyber context.\nArticle 50 enumerates certain definite restrictions on countermeasures: they ‘shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law’. So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthese acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nThose are cumulative conditions, the second following the first. In cases of urgency, however, the injured State may take those measures that are ‘necessary to preserve its rights’, an exception to the abovementioned paragraph 1(b) as stipulated by paragraph 2 of the same Article. Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited, which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ. The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’, thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.\n## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks\nWhen countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter. The same can be said about statements by State representatives. What\n Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nsuch an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’, which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’. However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’. As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory. In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96]\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninformation technologies'.97 The recently completed Tallinn Manual expressly applies the Corfu Channel standard to cyber security matters by framing the rule that '[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States'.98 Still, while there might in fact remain little doubt that such an obligation is to be considered as reflecting the current state of customary international law, the rule's specific content is much less clear. As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof the accused State, and that the State failed in its due diligence obligations under the duty to prevent the attack. Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources. For political purposes, this sort\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nof attribution may be sufficient, $^{110}$  but the same can hardly be said in establishing legal responsibility as long as clear and convincing technical evidence is absent. Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\noccurs over a period of time, the chance of being able to obtain sufficient evidence – technical and otherwise – after each instance in order to identify the territory of origin is significantly increased. In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121]\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack. This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures, it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code, endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’, ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’. However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum. Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n Ibid, 388.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 5.\n Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\ntowards it. The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important. In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights, which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’, and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures. Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended. Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible. Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle, at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b).

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139]\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nState with its international obligations of cessation and reparation’, which means that they can only be ‘justified [...] insofar as they continue to be necessary to that end’. When active cyber defences are employed against the source of the attack, this aspect could turn out to be critical. At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’, or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’. However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n Ibid.\n Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nits duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nNecessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^[151]^\nStill, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^[152]^ and occasionally still called into question,^[153]^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^[154]^ According to the text of the norm:\n[n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine. The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment, grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations, and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack. Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’, virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’. Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166]\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nthe fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’. This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project. Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’, meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’. Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’. As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment. Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care, which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 6.\n Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nIn any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nactive defences, as envisaged inter alia by the Tallinn Manual. Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law,[185] which would mean that it would not\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nalready be precluded by way of Article 26 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it seems reasonable to conclude that a forceful protective reaction would inevitably ‘seriously impair the essential interest[s] of the target State concerning respect for its territorial integrity’. Furthermore, and even more strikingly, it might be argued that the UN Charter sets up a legal regime concerning legal uses of force that implicitly excludes the invocation of necessity pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nUltimately, the analysis of necessity in view of cyber security leaves a mixed impression at best. While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties, or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*. The most frequently cited example for a standalone regime, even if only rarely – if ever – actually\n Thus expressly Rytter, 2001, Humanitarian Intervention without the Security Council: From San Francisco to Kosovo – and Beyond, 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 121, 134 et seq..\n Corten, *op cit.*, 48: ‘Une interprétation du texte de la Charte, tel qu’il a été conçu puis interprété par le biais de plusieurs résolutions adoptées par l’Assemblée générale, confirme que la prohibition du recours à la force représente un régime juridique qui n’admet pas d’échappatoire.’ (emphasis added).\n Sloane, *op cit.*, 454, suggests that the number of such provisions must be ‘hundreds’; see e.g. Article 4(1) ICCPR; Article 15(1) ECHR; Article 27(1) ACHR; Article XXI(b)(iii) GATT; Article XI of the 1991 Treaty Between United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; Article XX(1)(d) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and Iran; Article 221(1) UNCLOS.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninvoked by a State, $^{189}$ is the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (Intervention Convention). Drafted and agreed upon after the disastrous Torrey Canyon oil tanker accident off the Cornish coast in 1967. $^{190}$ Although the bombing of the wrecked Liberian-registered tanker by the United Kingdom in order to burn the spilling oil and prevent it from reaching the coast was not justified in legal terms, the action was cited early on as one example for the existence of a customary law defence of necessity. $^{191}$ Even though it was not met with legal resistance by other States, $^{192}$ in the aftermath of the incident it was quickly deemed necessary to come up with a specific multilateral convention that outlines the exact preconditions and legal consequences of such emergency actions on the high seas, as 'States preferred to establish clear international law on the legal issues arising out of such accidental spills rather than to leave comparable future incidents to the unilateral judgments of affected States'. $^{193}$\nWithout going into detail as regards the exact content of such a legal regime, it is likely that the Intervention Convention may provide a model for a parallel treaty that would govern States' reactions to future hazardous cyber incidents. The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\n# 4. In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As those duties can by now be considered firmly established, it seems reasonable to assume that obligations concerning cyber security incidents will run along similar lines. As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’. Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States, required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’. Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred. Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbreaches. Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.\nIn the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident. As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident. This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthreats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight, unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.\n.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity. For such\n Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nacts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force, hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force. Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nno physical harm is done. Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures. However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’. The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nto establish a fact as given is less clear. Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt. While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general, as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’. This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be. The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence. Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.\n O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments. Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic, ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour. Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure. The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks. Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’ or ‘entry-point anonymity’; the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nestablished. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nsingle incident which prompted it. $^{32}$  While being a reasonable assertion on the face of it, this statement points to a dangerous development. With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, $^{33}$  it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. $^{34}$  In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded\nThe looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion $^{35}$  that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' $^{36}$  to 'overall control' $^{37}$  does not touch upon the issue of identification. $^{38}$  Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, $^{39}$  or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', $^{40}$  can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, $^{41}$  and it is\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbeyond any doubt that international law requires attribution. Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity\n## 3.1 Countermeasures\n## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures\nThe first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in\n Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nconformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nCountermeasures may not, therefore, be employed in order to punish the adversary.50 However, the commentary to Rule 9 of the Tallinn Manual notes that State practice is ambiguous in this regard, as States ‘sometimes appear to be motivated by punitive considerations when resorting to countermeasures’.51 In any case, to achieve the goal of restoration of compliance, the injured State is under no obligation to resort to means that ‘mirror the underlying wrongful act against which they are directed’.52 There might be good arguments in favour of a concept of reciprocity with regard to the necessity and proportionality requirements,53 but the ILC rightly observes that ‘a limitation to reciprocal countermeasures assumes that the injured State will be in a position to impose the same or related measures as the responsible State, which may not be so’.54 As explained below, this assessment is particularly relevant in the cyber context.\nArticle 50 enumerates certain definite restrictions on countermeasures: they ‘shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law’. So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthese acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nThose are cumulative conditions, the second following the first. In cases of urgency, however, the injured State may take those measures that are ‘necessary to preserve its rights’, an exception to the abovementioned paragraph 1(b) as stipulated by paragraph 2 of the same Article. Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited, which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ. The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’, thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.\n## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks\nWhen countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter. The same can be said about statements by State representatives. What\n Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nsuch an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’, which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’. However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’. As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory. In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96]\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninformation technologies'.97 The recently completed Tallinn Manual expressly applies the Corfu Channel standard to cyber security matters by framing the rule that '[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States'.98 Still, while there might in fact remain little doubt that such an obligation is to be considered as reflecting the current state of customary international law, the rule's specific content is much less clear. As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof the accused State, and that the State failed in its due diligence obligations under the duty to prevent the attack. Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources. For political purposes, this sort\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nof attribution may be sufficient, $^{110}$  but the same can hardly be said in establishing legal responsibility as long as clear and convincing technical evidence is absent. Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\noccurs over a period of time, the chance of being able to obtain sufficient evidence – technical and otherwise – after each instance in order to identify the territory of origin is significantly increased. In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121]\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack. This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures, it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code, endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’, ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’. However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum. Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n Ibid, 388.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 5.\n Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\ntowards it. The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important. In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights, which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’, and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures. Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended. Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible. Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle, at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b).

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139]\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nState with its international obligations of cessation and reparation’, which means that they can only be ‘justified [...] insofar as they continue to be necessary to that end’. When active cyber defences are employed against the source of the attack, this aspect could turn out to be critical. At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’, or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’. However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n Ibid.\n Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nits duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nNecessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^[151]^\nStill, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^[152]^ and occasionally still called into question,^[153]^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^[154]^ According to the text of the norm:\n[n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine. The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment, grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations, and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack. Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’, virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’. Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166]\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nthe fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’. This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project. Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’, meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’. Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’. As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment. Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care, which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 6.\n Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nIn any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nactive defences, as envisaged inter alia by the Tallinn Manual. Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law,[185] which would mean that it would not\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nalready be precluded by way of Article 26 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it seems reasonable to conclude that a forceful protective reaction would inevitably ‘seriously impair the essential interest[s] of the target State concerning respect for its territorial integrity’. Furthermore, and even more strikingly, it might be argued that the UN Charter sets up a legal regime concerning legal uses of force that implicitly excludes the invocation of necessity pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nUltimately, the analysis of necessity in view of cyber security leaves a mixed impression at best. While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties, or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*. The most frequently cited example for a standalone regime, even if only rarely – if ever – actually\n Thus expressly Rytter, 2001, Humanitarian Intervention without the Security Council: From San Francisco to Kosovo – and Beyond, 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 121, 134 et seq..\n Corten, *op cit.*, 48: ‘Une interprétation du texte de la Charte, tel qu’il a été conçu puis interprété par le biais de plusieurs résolutions adoptées par l’Assemblée générale, confirme que la prohibition du recours à la force représente un régime juridique qui n’admet pas d’échappatoire.’ (emphasis added).\n Sloane, *op cit.*, 454, suggests that the number of such provisions must be ‘hundreds’; see e.g. Article 4(1) ICCPR; Article 15(1) ECHR; Article 27(1) ACHR; Article XXI(b)(iii) GATT; Article XI of the 1991 Treaty Between United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; Article XX(1)(d) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and Iran; Article 221(1) UNCLOS.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninvoked by a State, $^{189}$ is the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (Intervention Convention). Drafted and agreed upon after the disastrous Torrey Canyon oil tanker accident off the Cornish coast in 1967. $^{190}$ Although the bombing of the wrecked Liberian-registered tanker by the United Kingdom in order to burn the spilling oil and prevent it from reaching the coast was not justified in legal terms, the action was cited early on as one example for the existence of a customary law defence of necessity. $^{191}$ Even though it was not met with legal resistance by other States, $^{192}$ in the aftermath of the incident it was quickly deemed necessary to come up with a specific multilateral convention that outlines the exact preconditions and legal consequences of such emergency actions on the high seas, as 'States preferred to establish clear international law on the legal issues arising out of such accidental spills rather than to leave comparable future incidents to the unilateral judgments of affected States'. $^{193}$\nWithout going into detail as regards the exact content of such a legal regime, it is likely that the Intervention Convention may provide a model for a parallel treaty that would govern States' reactions to future hazardous cyber incidents. The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\n# 4. In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As those duties can by now be considered firmly established, it seems reasonable to assume that obligations concerning cyber security incidents will run along similar lines. As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’. Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States, required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’. Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred. Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbreaches. Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.\nIn the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident. As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident. This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthreats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight, unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.\n.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity. For such\n Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nacts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force, hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force. Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nno physical harm is done. Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures. However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’. The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nto establish a fact as given is less clear. Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt. While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general, as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’. This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be. The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence. Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.\n O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments. Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic, ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour. Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure. The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks. Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’ or ‘entry-point anonymity’; the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nestablished. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nsingle incident which prompted it. $^{32}$  While being a reasonable assertion on the face of it, this statement points to a dangerous development. With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, $^{33}$  it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. $^{34}$  In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded\nThe looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion $^{35}$  that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' $^{36}$  to 'overall control' $^{37}$  does not touch upon the issue of identification. $^{38}$  Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, $^{39}$  or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', $^{40}$  can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, $^{41}$  and it is\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbeyond any doubt that international law requires attribution. Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity\n## 3.1 Countermeasures\n## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures\nThe first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in\n Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nconformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nCountermeasures may not, therefore, be employed in order to punish the adversary.50 However, the commentary to Rule 9 of the Tallinn Manual notes that State practice is ambiguous in this regard, as States ‘sometimes appear to be motivated by punitive considerations when resorting to countermeasures’.51 In any case, to achieve the goal of restoration of compliance, the injured State is under no obligation to resort to means that ‘mirror the underlying wrongful act against which they are directed’.52 There might be good arguments in favour of a concept of reciprocity with regard to the necessity and proportionality requirements,53 but the ILC rightly observes that ‘a limitation to reciprocal countermeasures assumes that the injured State will be in a position to impose the same or related measures as the responsible State, which may not be so’.54 As explained below, this assessment is particularly relevant in the cyber context.\nArticle 50 enumerates certain definite restrictions on countermeasures: they ‘shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law’. So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthese acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nThose are cumulative conditions, the second following the first. In cases of urgency, however, the injured State may take those measures that are ‘necessary to preserve its rights’, an exception to the abovementioned paragraph 1(b) as stipulated by paragraph 2 of the same Article. Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited, which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ. The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’, thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.\n## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks\nWhen countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter. The same can be said about statements by State representatives. What\n Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

Völkerrechtliche Regelungsmöglichkeiten bei unsicherer Zurechnung im Cyberwar, 50 Archiv des Völkerrechts 1, 14 (2012).\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nis usually envisaged is a function of countermeasures that is akin to self-defence, but reserved for situations where, absent the existence of an armed attack, self-defence is not an option.75 Hence, protection against an imminent or ongoing cyber attack will be achieved through offensive action – infringing on the rights of another State – justified as a countermeasure in accordance with the provisions as enshrined in the ILC Articles. The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nsuch an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’, which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’. However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’. As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory. In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96]\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninformation technologies'.97 The recently completed Tallinn Manual expressly applies the Corfu Channel standard to cyber security matters by framing the rule that '[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States'.98 Still, while there might in fact remain little doubt that such an obligation is to be considered as reflecting the current state of customary international law, the rule's specific content is much less clear. As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof the accused State, and that the State failed in its due diligence obligations under the duty to prevent the attack. Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources. For political purposes, this sort\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nof attribution may be sufficient, $^{110}$  but the same can hardly be said in establishing legal responsibility as long as clear and convincing technical evidence is absent. Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\noccurs over a period of time, the chance of being able to obtain sufficient evidence – technical and otherwise – after each instance in order to identify the territory of origin is significantly increased. In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121]\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack. This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures, it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code, endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’, ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’. However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum. Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n Ibid, 388.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 5.\n Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\ntowards it. The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important. In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights, which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’, and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures. Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended. Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible. Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle, at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b).

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139]\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nState with its international obligations of cessation and reparation’, which means that they can only be ‘justified [...] insofar as they continue to be necessary to that end’. When active cyber defences are employed against the source of the attack, this aspect could turn out to be critical. At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’, or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’. However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n Ibid.\n Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nits duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nNecessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^[151]^\nStill, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^[152]^ and occasionally still called into question,^[153]^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^[154]^ According to the text of the norm:\n[n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine. The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment, grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations, and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack. Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’, virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’. Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166]\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nthe fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’. This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project. Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’, meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’. Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’. As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment. Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care, which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n Ibid., at para. 6.\n Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nIn any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nactive defences, as envisaged inter alia by the Tallinn Manual. Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law,[185] which would mean that it would not\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nalready be precluded by way of Article 26 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it seems reasonable to conclude that a forceful protective reaction would inevitably ‘seriously impair the essential interest[s] of the target State concerning respect for its territorial integrity’. Furthermore, and even more strikingly, it might be argued that the UN Charter sets up a legal regime concerning legal uses of force that implicitly excludes the invocation of necessity pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nUltimately, the analysis of necessity in view of cyber security leaves a mixed impression at best. While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties, or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*. The most frequently cited example for a standalone regime, even if only rarely – if ever – actually\n Thus expressly Rytter, 2001, Humanitarian Intervention without the Security Council: From San Francisco to Kosovo – and Beyond, 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 121, 134 et seq..\n Corten, *op cit.*, 48: ‘Une interprétation du texte de la Charte, tel qu’il a été conçu puis interprété par le biais de plusieurs résolutions adoptées par l’Assemblée générale, confirme que la prohibition du recours à la force représente un régime juridique qui n’admet pas d’échappatoire.’ (emphasis added).\n Sloane, *op cit.*, 454, suggests that the number of such provisions must be ‘hundreds’; see e.g. Article 4(1) ICCPR; Article 15(1) ECHR; Article 27(1) ACHR; Article XXI(b)(iii) GATT; Article XI of the 1991 Treaty Between United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; Article XX(1)(d) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and Iran; Article 221(1) UNCLOS.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninvoked by a State, $^{189}$ is the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (Intervention Convention). Drafted and agreed upon after the disastrous Torrey Canyon oil tanker accident off the Cornish coast in 1967. $^{190}$ Although the bombing of the wrecked Liberian-registered tanker by the United Kingdom in order to burn the spilling oil and prevent it from reaching the coast was not justified in legal terms, the action was cited early on as one example for the existence of a customary law defence of necessity. $^{191}$ Even though it was not met with legal resistance by other States, $^{192}$ in the aftermath of the incident it was quickly deemed necessary to come up with a specific multilateral convention that outlines the exact preconditions and legal consequences of such emergency actions on the high seas, as 'States preferred to establish clear international law on the legal issues arising out of such accidental spills rather than to leave comparable future incidents to the unilateral judgments of affected States'. $^{193}$\nWithout going into detail as regards the exact content of such a legal regime, it is likely that the Intervention Convention may provide a model for a parallel treaty that would govern States' reactions to future hazardous cyber incidents. The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\n# 4. In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As those duties can by now be considered firmly established, it seems reasonable to assume that obligations concerning cyber security incidents will run along similar lines. As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’. Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States, required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’. Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred. Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbreaches. Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.\nIn the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident. As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident. This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthreats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight, unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.\n."

Introduction\nIn recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence\n### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks\nSo far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity.¹ For such\n¹ Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National\n621\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nacts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force,² hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force.³ Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.⁴\nApart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues⁵ that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where\nSecurity Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n2 Benatar, 2009, The Use of Cyber Force: Need for Legal Justification? 1 Goettingen Journal of International Law 375, 389; Woltag, 2010, Cyber Warfare, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford, at para. 8.\n3 Schmitt, op. cit., 1999, 913, Roscini, op. cit., 106; Woltag, op. cit., para. 8; Waxman, op. cit., 431 et seq.; Joyner/Lotrionte, 2001, Information Warfare as International Coercion: Elements of a Legal Framework, 12 European Journal of International Law 825, 863, Keber/Roguski, 2011, Jus ad bellum electronicum?

Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures.⁶ However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution\nApart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’.⁷ The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’⁸ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order\n⁶ Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n⁷ Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n⁸ International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nto establish a fact as given is less clear.⁹ Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt.¹⁰ While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general,¹¹ as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’.¹² This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’¹³ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be.¹⁴ The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence.¹⁵ Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.¹⁶\n⁹ O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n¹⁰ Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n¹¹ Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n¹² The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments.¹⁷ Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic,¹⁸ ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’¹⁹ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour.²⁰ Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure.²¹ The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks.²² Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’²³ or ‘entry-point anonymity’;²⁴ the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally\nUse of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n¹⁷ Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n¹⁸ Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n¹⁹ Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n²⁰ Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n²¹ Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n²² Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n²³ Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n²⁴ Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n625\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nestablished. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US). Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published. Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’, with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’. In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met. However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’. According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the\n25 Mandiant, APT1 – Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, Mandiant, 2013, available at: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf; Minnick, China Cyberwarfare Evidence Now Undeniable – Mandiant, Intercepts, The Official Blog of Defense News International, 19 February 2013, available at: http://blogs.defensenews.com/intercepts/2013/02/china-cyberwarfare-evidence-now-undeniable-mandiant/; Sanger, Barboza, Perlroth, 2003, Chinese Army Unit Is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S., New York Times, 19 Feb, p.

With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, $^{33}$  it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. $^{34}$  In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded\nThe looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion $^{35}$  that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' $^{36}$  to 'overall control' $^{37}$  does not touch upon the issue of identification. $^{38}$  Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, $^{39}$  or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', $^{40}$  can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, $^{41}$  and it is\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbeyond any doubt that international law requires attribution.⁴² Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.⁴³\n## 2.4 Interim Conclusion\nIt is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity\n## 3.1 Countermeasures\n## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures\nThe first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in\n⁴² Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n⁴³ Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n628\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nconformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n44 Alland, 2010, The Definition of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of\n50 ILC Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 1; traditionally, reprisals comprised ‘a perceived moral right to punish the responsible State’s delict’, Calamita, 2009, Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue, 42 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1393, 1420; see on this point critically Bederman, 2002, Counterintuiting Countermeasures, 96 *American Journal of International Law* 817, 822: ‘This change in emphasis on the nature and purpose of countermeasures likewise places in some doubt the Commission’s use of earlier international law sources.’\n51 Tallinn Manual, *op cit.*, at 37.\n52 Calamita, 2011, Countermeasures and Jurisdiction: Between Effectiveness and Fragmentation, 42 *Georgetown Journal of International Law* 233, 243.\n53 ILC Articles, Commentaries, Part Three Chapter II, at para. 5.\n54 *Ibid.*\n55 See in general Leben, *op cit.*, 1197 *et seq.*\n56 ICJ, *Oil Platforms*, Separate Opinion of Judge Simma, at para. 12.\n630\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthese acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66\nProcedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n57 ICJ, Nicaragua, at para. 249.\n58 Gazzini, 2005, The Changing Rules on the Use of Force in International Law, Manchester, 169; Barsotti, 1986, Armed Reprisals, in Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force, Dordrecht, 81, 90 et seq.; Zimmermann, 2007, The Second Lebanon War: Jus ad Bellum, Jus in Bello and the Issue of Proportionality, 11 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 99, 104 et seq.\n59 Franck, 2002, Recourse to Force.

Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited,⁶⁸ which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’⁶⁹ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ.⁷⁰ The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’,⁷¹ thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.⁷²\n## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks\nWhen countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁷³ The same can be said about statements by State representatives.⁷⁴ What\n⁶⁷ Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are:\nproactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76\nIn other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80\nThe main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in\n75 But see O’Connell, 2012, op cit., 205, who expressly envisages a different role for countermeasures in the cyber security context.\n76 Tallinn Manual, op cit., Glossary of Technical Terms, 257.\n77 Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n78 Hathaway, op. cit., 858.\n79 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (United States of America v France), 9 December 1978, 18 RIAA 416.\n80 ILC Commentaries, Part Three, Chapter II, at para. 5.\n81 See para. 2.2.\n82 Hinkle, op. cit., 18 et seq.\n633\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nsuch an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.⁸³ Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’,⁸⁴ which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’.⁸⁵ However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’.⁸⁶ As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory.⁸⁷ In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation\n⁸³ Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n⁸⁴ Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n⁸⁵ *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n⁸⁶ Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision, the ICJ referred to its earlier case law in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'. According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.' While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'. The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism. In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda, a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.\nEarly on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse\n88 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 101.\n89 Most notably ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22; ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, at para. 29.\n90 ICJ, Pulp Mills, at para. 101.\n91 Ibid.\n92 Trail Smelter case (United States of America v Canada), 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, 3 RIAA 1905.\n93 ICJ, Corfu Channel, 22.\n94 Heathcote, 2012, State Omissions and Due Diligence: Aspects of Fault, Damage and Contribution to Injury in the Law of State Responsibility, in Heathcote et al.

As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory\n97 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n98 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n99 ICJ, Case concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'. Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran. While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack', including intelligence or political sources.

Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. $^{111}$ As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. $^{112}$\nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'. This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case. Thus, if a series of cyber attacks\n110 See Ziolkowski, 2012, op cit., 306.\n111 See e.g. Markoff et al., 2010, In Digital Combat, U.S. Finds No Easy Deterrent, The New York Times, [online] 25 Jan, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/26cyber.html, about a cyber attack simulation carried out by the U.S. Department of Defense: ‘No one could pinpoint the country from which the attack came.’\n112 See the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James R.

In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence. Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State. Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors. However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation. Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law, Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it:\nsuggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.\nWhile far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be\n116 Deeks, 2012, ‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense, 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483; Schmitt, 2003, Preemptive Strategies in International Law, 24 Michigan Journal of International Law 513, 541 et seq.; Tallinn Manual, Rule 13, para. 22 et seq.\n117 Sklerov, op. cit., 13 and 38 et seq.\n118 In this sense Schmitt, Preemptive Strategies, 541 et seq.; the Tallinn Manual’s position on this matter is ambiguous.\n119 For a comparison of both lines of argumentation see Tams, 2009, op cit., 384 et seq.\n120 See Deeks, op. cit., 546.\n121 Tams, 2009, op. cit., 385.\n639\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack.¹²² This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures,¹²³ it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.¹²⁴\nComing back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code,¹²⁵ endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’,¹²⁶ ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’.¹²⁷ However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum.¹²⁸ Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility\n¹²² Ibid, 388.\n¹²³ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n¹²⁴ Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n¹²⁵ Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n¹²⁶ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., at para. 5.\n¹²⁸ Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\ntowards it.¹²⁹ The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important.¹³⁰ In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights,¹³¹ which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’,¹³² and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.¹³³\nThe same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures.¹³⁴ Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended.¹³⁵ Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible.¹³⁶ Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle,¹³⁷ at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b).

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.' In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.\nThe third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC $^{140}$  – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. $^{141}$  This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. $^{142}$  When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. $^{143}$  However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. $^{144}$  Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target\n138 Caltagirone/Frinkke, *op. cit.*, 263.\n139 Such a prospective tactic might even be likened to the use of so-called ‘human shields’ in armed conflicts; see e.g. Gross, 2002, Use of Civilians as Human Shields: What Legal and Moral Restrictions Pertain to a War Waged by a Democratic State Against Terrorism?, *Emory International Law Review*, 445.\n140 ILC Articles, Commentaries, Part Three Chapter II, at 5.\n141 Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 20.\n142 Case Concerning the Air Services Agreement of 27 March 1946 (*United States of America v. France*), 9 December 1978, 18 RIAA 416, at para. 83.\n143 See Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 20.\n144 See para. 3.1.2.\n642\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nState with its international obligations of cessation and reparation’,¹⁴⁵ which means that they can only be ‘justified [...] insofar as they continue to be necessary to that end’.¹⁴⁶ When active cyber defences are employed against the source of the attack, this aspect could turn out to be critical. At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’,¹⁴⁷ or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’¹⁴⁸ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’.¹⁴⁹ However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’¹⁵⁰ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with\n¹⁴⁵ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n¹⁴⁸ Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n¹⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n¹⁵⁰ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n643\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nits duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity\nIf self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n644\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nNecessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^^\nStill, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^^ and occasionally still called into question,^^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^^ According to the text of the norm:\n[n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine.¹⁵⁵ The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment,¹⁵⁶ grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations,¹⁵⁷ and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack.¹⁵⁸ Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’,¹⁵⁹ virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts.¹⁶⁰ Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’.¹⁶¹ Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n¹⁵⁵ Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred', it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'. This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists. In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity. As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.\nApart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes. In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack. Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity', but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nthe fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’.¹⁷⁰ This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project.¹⁷¹ Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’,¹⁷² meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’.¹⁷³ Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’.¹⁷⁴ As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment.¹⁷⁵ Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care,¹⁷⁶ which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n¹⁷⁰ Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n¹⁷¹ ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n¹⁷² Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n¹⁷³ Ibid., at para. 6.\n¹⁷⁴ Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n¹⁷⁵ Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n¹⁷⁶ Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nIn any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail. This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'. Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'. This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ\n177 See e.g. ICJ, Wall advisory opinion, at para. 140; ITLOS, The M/V 'Saiga' (No. 2) Case (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v.

Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’. This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’, forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine. The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’, under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism. A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law, which would mean that it would not\n180 Ibid., at para. 17.\n181 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 39.\n182 Ibid.\n183 See Definition of Aggression, GA/Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 December 1974.\n184 See already Ago, Eighth Report on State Responsibility.

While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties,¹⁸⁸ or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*. The most frequently cited example for a standalone regime, even if only rarely – if ever – actually\n¹⁸⁶ Thus expressly Rytter, 2001, Humanitarian Intervention without the Security Council: From San Francisco to Kosovo – and Beyond, 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 121, 134 et seq..\n¹⁸⁷ Corten, *op cit.*, 48: ‘Une interprétation du texte de la Charte, tel qu’il a été conçu puis interprété par le biais de plusieurs résolutions adoptées par l’Assemblée générale, confirme que la prohibition du recours à la force représente un régime juridique qui n’admet pas d’échappatoire.’ (emphasis added).\n¹⁸⁸ Sloane, *op cit.*, 454, suggests that the number of such provisions must be ‘hundreds’; see e.g. Article 4(1) ICCPR; Article 15(1) ECHR; Article 27(1) ACHR; Article XXI(b)(iii) GATT; Article XI of the 1991 Treaty Between United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; Article XX(1)(d) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and Iran; Article 221(1) UNCLOS.\n651\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\ninvoked by a State, $^{189}$ is the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (Intervention Convention). Drafted and agreed upon after the disastrous Torrey Canyon oil tanker accident off the Cornish coast in 1967. $^{190}$ Although the bombing of the wrecked Liberian-registered tanker by the United Kingdom in order to burn the spilling oil and prevent it from reaching the coast was not justified in legal terms, the action was cited early on as one example for the existence of a customary law defence of necessity. $^{191}$ Even though it was not met with legal resistance by other States, $^{192}$ in the aftermath of the incident it was quickly deemed necessary to come up with a specific multilateral convention that outlines the exact preconditions and legal consequences of such emergency actions on the high seas, as 'States preferred to establish clear international law on the legal issues arising out of such accidental spills rather than to leave comparable future incidents to the unilateral judgments of affected States'. $^{193}$\nWithout going into detail as regards the exact content of such a legal regime, it is likely that the Intervention Convention may provide a model for a parallel treaty that would govern States' reactions to future hazardous cyber incidents. The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n189 Wendel, 2007, State Responsibility for Interferences with the Freedom of Navigation in Public International Law, Heidelberg, at 49.\n190 See BBC News, On This Day: 1967: Supertanker Torrey Canyon hits rocks, available at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/18/newsid_4242000/4242709.stm.\n191 See Ago, Eighth Report on State Responsibility.

In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace\nSo far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’.²⁰¹ Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States,²⁰² required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’.²⁰³ Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred.²⁰⁴ Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.²⁰⁵\nThe duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence\nis an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.²⁰⁶\nWhile the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty\n200 See most significantly UN GA Res. 49/60 (9 December 1994); UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000); UN SC Res. 1368 (12 September 2001); UN SC Res. 1373 (28 September 2001).\n201 UN GA Res. 55/63 (4 December 2000).\n202 Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, CET 185, signed 23 November 2001, effective 1 July 2004.\n203 Sklerov, op. cit., note 382 and accompanying text; see Convention on Cybercrime, Chapter II, Section 1, Articles 2 to 13.\n204 Sklerov, op. cit., 12; Kulesza, 2009, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security, 29 Polish Yearbook of International Law 139, 141.\n205 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 26.\n206 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197.\n654\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nof mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security\n207 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 27.\n208 ICJ, The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits), Judgment of 9 April 1949, at 22: '[...] the laying of the minefield [...] could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government'.\n209 Ibid., at 20.\n210 See the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue by UN Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue A/HRC/23/40, 17 April 2013.\n211 Tallinn Manual, op cit., 28.\n212 See generally Schröder, 2012, Precautionary Approach/Principle, in Wolfrum (ed.), The Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, Oxford University Press.\n213 ITLOS, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, at paras. 132-135.\n214 Krieger, op. cit., 19.\n215 ICJ, Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentine v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, para. 223.\n655\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention\nbreaches.²¹⁶ Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.²¹⁷\nIn the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident.²¹⁸ As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident.²¹⁹ This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those\n216 Krieger, op. cit., 19; for the corresponding aspect in relation to environmental law and precaution see Foster, 2011, Science and the Precautionary Principle in International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge, p. 35: ‘[...] working towards achieving the right balance between development and environmental protection has in general required the international community to focus on international cooperation rather than on State responsibility’.\n217 European Union, EU Cybersecurity Plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity, press release IP/13/94, 7 February 2013, available at: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm; for Germany, Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit informationstechnischer Systeme, 7 March 2013, available at: http://bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/Entwuerfe/Entwurf_it-sicherheitsgesetz.html; the latter proposition by the Federal Ministry of the Interior however has met fierce opposition on the part of the concerned enterprises, see Cyberangriffe: Hacker-Meldepflicht für Unternehmen offenbar vor dem Aus, Spiegel [online], 5 June 2013, available at: http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/hacker-meldepflicht-fuer-unternehmen-offenbar-vor-dem-aus-a-903824.html.\n218 Kulesza, op. cit., 149.\n219 In this sense it might be said that, in 2007, Russia violated its due diligence obligation towards Estonia when it failed to cooperate to mitigate or obstruct the ongoing DDoS attacks emanating from its territory despite formal requests by Estonian authorities; see Evron, 2008, Battling Botnets and Online Mobs, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 121, 124.\n656\nPART III\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace\nthreats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion\nFor the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight,²²⁰ unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n²²⁰ See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.\n."

Introduction In recent years, international cyber security has become one of the most hotly discussed topics of international law, not only because inter-State cyber security incidents have grown in number and severity, but also because of the realisation that the technical peculiarities of cyberspace pose new and unique legal problems that previously have not been encountered. Thus far, however, inter-State cyber security has unfortunately been treated predominantly as a military issue and as a consequence debate has, by and large, revolved around the question of whether, and under which conditions, measures of self-defence pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) are feasible and permitted in response to a cyber attack. This chapter argues that, while self-defence certainly cannot be ruled out, the problem of attribution will preclude its proper application in many, if not most, instances. Therefore, two other remedies will be analysed that might present an alternative to the prevalent military paradigm of international cyber security: countermeasures and the state of necessity. The chapter provides an outlook on the possibilities of a more comprehensive approach to contemporary security issues that focuses on prevention rather than repression, drawing on States’ international due diligence obligations not to harm others.\n## 2. Cyber Security and the Military Paradigm: Self-Defence ### 2.1 Cyber Attacks as Armed Attacks So far, both academic and political discussion concerning inter-State cyber threats has focused on whether a State which is the victim of a cyber attack (in the meaning of malicious cyber activities) may respond with force by invoking its inherent right to act in self-defence against the attacker State, or other attacking entity.¹ For such ¹ Antolin-Jenkins, 2005, Defining the Parameters of Cyberwar Operations: Looking for Law in all the Wrong Places?, 51 Naval Law Review 132; Barkham, 2001, Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force, 34 New York University Journal of International Law &amp; Politics 57; Hoisington, 2009, Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense, 32 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439; Jensen, 2002, Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense, 38 Stanford Journal of International Law 207; Kesan/Hayes, 2012, Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace, 25 Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 429; Li, 2013, When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?, 38 The Yale Journal of International Law 179; Lin, 2010, Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force, 4 Journal of National Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention acts to be lawful under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the cyber attack would not only have to be considered a use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but moreover amount to an armed attack. While traditionally the definition of the term ‘armed attack’ as laid down in Article 51 would have involved a notion of kinetic force,² hence following an instrumental approach that primarily centred upon the means of conduct, such an approach has been almost unanimously rejected in the academic literature dealing with cyber attacks. As this form of conduct, by definition, does not employ kinetic force, limiting ‘armed attack’ to harm caused by traditional military means would plainly mean that a cyber attack could never be regarded as an armed attack, a conclusion obviously unreasonable considering the potential damage done by cyber attacks. Thus, most commentators today agree that the focus of attention should lie not on the means but on the consequences of an attack, and the common denominator is that of equivalence: a cyber attack amounts to an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 if its effects are equivalent to those caused by a conventional attack employing kinetic force.³ Thus, whenever the use of cyber means for malicious ends leads to considerable physical damage or even to the injury or death of people, that attack has been ‘armed’, and as a consequence triggers the right of self-defence of the victim State. This approach is hardly new: absent kinetic force, the use of biological or chemical weapons could never have been considered an armed attack without this particular line of argument.⁴ Apart from this general consensus, a few voices seek to broaden the scope of ‘armed attack’ to include attacks whose effects are not equivalent to consequences of the employment of kinetic force, but remain purely within the realm of cyberspace. Drawing an analogy with naval blockades, Li, for instance, argues⁵ that ‘DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks can be categorised as armed attacks for jus ad bellum purposes if their impacts on the victim State are sufficiently severe’, even in cases where Security Law &amp; Policy 63; Roscini, 2010, World Wide Warfare - Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force, 14 Max Planck United Nations Yearbook 85; Schmitt, 1999, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885; Schmitt, 2012, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Villanova Law Review 569; Sklerov, 2009, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 1; Stein/Marauhn, 2000, Völkerrechtliche Aspekte von Informationsoperationen, 60 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 1; Waxman, 2011, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 The Yale Journal of International Law 421.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace no physical harm is done. Still further from the prevalent view, Melnitzky makes a rather far-fetched attempt to include even cyber espionage that involves data theft as an armed attack justifying self-defence measures.⁶ However, both arguments overstretch by far the possible reach of the term ‘armed attack’. To consider any cyber operation that involves some sort of malicious intent as an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter not only blurs the lines between this notion and the equally internationally prohibited intervention into other States’ affairs with coercive means, but moreover contains the potential for dangerous and premature escalation of conflicts that could and should be solved peacefully.\n## 2.2 The Problem of Attribution Apart from the precise definition of ‘armed attack’ within the cyber context, the greatest challenge for the application of the doctrine of self-defence to the new threats that arrive as a by-product of technological developments is the attribution of ‘unlawful conduct’. In 1987, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal asserted that ‘[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State’.⁷ The second part of this construction – the association of a natural person with a State – is legally governed by Part One, Chapter II of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles on State Responsibility), Articles 4 to 11. In principle, no specific issues arise here that would not also be found in situations with no connection to cyberspace. The crucial problem is rather hinted at in the first part of the Tribunal’s assertion: the identification of the actor. As the technical peculiarities of cyberspace make it entirely possible to hide one’s own identity and to obliterate the traces of one’s actions, how can we ever know who carried out an attack? If it cannot be determined which individual has acted, then the provisions on the attribution of such conduct found in the Articles on State Responsibility are not of much use.\nThe problem of the identification of the actor is of course primarily a question of fact, but there is a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. To what degree does responsibility for a particular cyber attack need to be proven? While the burden of proof might be considered unambiguous – in the words of the ILC, in ‘a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State’⁸ – the amount or quality of evidence needed in order ⁶ Melnitzky, 2012, Defending America Against Chinese Cyber Espionage Through the Use of Active Defenses, 20 Cardozo Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 537, 566.\n⁷ Yeager v Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101-2.\n⁸ International Law Commission (ILC) Commentaries, Chapter V, at para. 8; Wolfrum, 2012, International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence, in Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, at para. 70; Green, 2009, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 ICLQ 163, 166.\nRobin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention to establish a fact as given is less clear.⁹ Four formalised standards can nonetheless be identified in international courts’ and tribunals’ jurisprudence in matters concerning State responsibility, and thus also the question concerning responsibility for an armed attack. Those are: the *prima facie* possibility of an asserted fact being true; a preponderance of evidence; the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard; and proof beyond reasonable doubt.¹⁰ While it is arguably preponderance of evidence that is the prevailing standard to be met in international litigation in general,¹¹ as soon as State responsibility is involved the required threshold appears to be considerably higher, shifting towards ‘clear and convincing’.¹² This standard essentially amounts to the duty to ‘convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.’¹³ This general pattern seems to have been adopted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which generally follows the principle that the more grave an allegation against a State, the higher the standard of proof needs to be.¹⁴ The assertion that another State has not only violated the prohibition on the use of force but has even carried out an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter is an allegation of considerable gravity. Accordingly, it may be inferred from the leading ICJ case law on the subject – *Nicaragua, Oil Platforms, and Armed Activities* – that the test which the Court implicitly applied, when determining whether a situation justifying self-defence had existed, was the standard of ‘clear and convincing’ evidence.¹⁵ Aside from the Court’s jurisprudence, other tribunals’ decisions as well as more general State practice confirm this standard as prevalent concerning evidentiary requirements when asserting another State’s responsibility or more specifically when claiming a right to use force in self-defence.¹⁶ ⁹ O’Connell, 2002, Evidence of Terror, 7 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 19, 21.\n¹⁰ Green, 2009, op cit., 166 et seq.; O’Connell, 2002, op cit., 22; O’Connell, 2006, Rules of Evidence for the Use of Force in International Law’s New Era, 100 Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 44, 45; Wolfrum, 2012, op cit., at para. 75, however only identifies ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘preponderance of evidence’ as frequently used; Kolb, 2006, General Principles of Procedural Law, in Zimmermann (ed.), The Statute of the International Court of Justic, at para. 62, lists three while omitting the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard.\n¹¹ Wolfrum, op cit., at para. 77.\n¹² The Trail Smelter Arbitration Case (United States of America v.

In view of the technical peculiarities of cyberspace, how likely is it to assume that it will be possible for a State that has become the victim of a cyber attack to sufficiently prove authorship? In recent years, several studies have eroded the hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments.¹⁷ Even almost fifteen years after the first ground-breaking legal study on the topic,¹⁸ ‘the determination of the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary’¹⁹ remains the most critical and to date unresolved obstacle to the application of the traditional regime of self-defence in the context of cyberspace. The reason for this has not changed: cyber infrastructure was never designed for tracking and tracing user behaviour.²⁰ Furthermore, software, either ‘benign’ or ‘malicious’, consists of nothing but code which, as a representation of data, is entirely capable of being manipulated in just about any measure.²¹ The current architecture of the internet and connected networks provides countless loopholes and methods to mask a user’s identity or location; online identities and servers can be hidden, data packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through multiple servers, and an attacker can hijack a machine belonging to an unaware, innocent individual or organisation in order to use it as a basis for launching cyber attacks.²² Because of those characteristics, reasonably sophisticated attackers will most often be able to effectively hide their traces. Even if an attacking computer can be located with sufficient certainty, what remains is the factor which commentators have called the ‘human machine gap’²³ or ‘entry-point anonymity’;²⁴ the location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine, and it is the latter’s status that ultimately determines attribution pursuant to Articles 4 to 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\nAt the same time one cannot prima facie rule out the possibility that, at least sometimes, a factual claim concerning authorship of a malicious network operation can be legally Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale Journal of International Law 537.\n¹⁷ Information Warfare Monitor, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network, 1 Sep 2009, available at: http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/.\n¹⁸ Schmitt, 1999, op cit., 885.\n¹⁹ Hunker, Hutchinson, Margulies, 2008, Attribution of Cyber Attacks on Process Control Systems, in Papa/Shenoi (eds.), Critical Infrastructure Protection II, New York/Heidelberg, 87, 88.\n²⁰ Lipson, 2002, Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, available at: http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/02sr009.cfm, 13-15.\n²¹ Gaycken, Krieg der Rechner, Internationale Politik, März/April 2011, 88, 92.\n²² Information Warfare Monitor, op. cit., 12.\n²³ Gaycken, op. cit., 94; Schneier, Anonymity and the Internet, Schneier on Security, 3 February 2010, available at: http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html.\n²⁴ Lipson, op. cit., 56.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention established. In those cases, the ‘traditional’ rules governing the use of force would apply. However, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts. This includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States (US).[25] Even if research such as that undertaken for the Mandiant study does eventually sufficiently prove authorship, it cannot be overlooked that it took their analysts several years to come up with conclusions that they themselves considered sufficiently convincing to be published.[26] Had the allegedly Chinese activity actually been a cyber attack, reaching the threshold of an armed attack within the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter only several years after the event, could the victim have responded with force invoking self-defence after such a period of time? The recently completed Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual),[27] points to the requirement of immediacy for self-defence to be permitted, meaning the period of time ‘following the execution of an armed attack within which the victim State may reasonably respond in self-defence’,[28] with one relevant factor inter alia being ‘the period necessary to identify the attacker’.[29] In cases where ‘the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack’ the criterion of immediacy will usually not be met.[30] However, the Tallinn Manual suggests that this conclusion may change if there is reason for the victim State to believe that ‘further cyber operations are likely to follow’ – in that case, the State ‘may treat those operations as a “cyber campaign” and continue to act in self-defence’.[31] According to this reasoning, the time span necessary to identify the attacker becomes less significant for the immediacy criterion even if it takes years to gather conclusive evidence, because ‘[i]f attacks can be accumulated, then a response will satisfy the immediacy requirement even if it comes too early or too late to repel the State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace single incident which prompted it. While being a reasonable assertion on the face of it, this statement points to a dangerous development. With regard to the US and its allies' 'war on terrorism' after 11 September 2001, which is essentially based on the same legal argument, it has been observed that such a reading of the immediacy criterion 'undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force'. In particular within the cyber context, the issue of uncertain attribution together with a softening of the immediacy requirement could critically raise the danger of escalation of inter-State conflict. Hence, the community of States should continue to demand a more stringent temporal proximity between an armed attack and its response invoking self-defence.\n# 2.3 Suggestions to Alter the Legal Standards Regarding Evidence and Attribution Should Be Discarded The looming attribution dilemma that might result in the inapplicability of the doctrine of self-defence in many scenarios has led to various scholarly attempts to find legally valid alternatives. So far, most of those arguments have directly tackled the rules of attribution or evidence. However, they either do not manage to solve the problem, or they find no basis in current international law. The suggestion that the standards of attribution should shift from 'effective control' to 'overall control' does not touch upon the issue of identification. Deliberations that aim to lower the evidentiary standard regarding cyberspace issues, emphasising the ex-ante perspective of decision-makers in emergency situations, or even bluntly asserting that the requirement of adequate attribution of an attack before resorting to self-defence measures is 'a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era', can hardly be considered legally tenable. There is widespread agreement that international law as it currently stands applies in cyberspace, and it is Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention beyond any doubt that international law requires attribution.⁴² Regarding the ex-ante perspective as critical might considerably undermine the jus contra bellum, as past cases have shown that this angle is structurally insufficient when it comes to the identification of cyber attacks. Finally, suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.⁴³ ## 2.4 Interim Conclusion It is now generally accepted that cyber attacks can reach the armed attack threshold stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter, thus triggering the right of self-defence which justifies an armed response, be it in return via cyberspace or carried out with more traditional means. However, while this finding holds true in principle, the standard of proof required by international law when making claims that involve another State’s responsibility (especially for an armed attack) in combination with the technical peculiarities of cyberspace will, in at least the majority of cases, effectively prevent the legal possibility of reaction with military means. All the arguments so far suggested which attempt to ‘circumvent’ the problem are unconvincing. Still, it cannot be denied that inter-State cyber attacks already occur, and will most likely increase in number in the future. Therefore, it cannot be enough simply to point to the near inapplicability of the self-defence doctrine: to meet States’ legitimate security interests, it is necessary to seek alternatives. Feasible solutions to the problem will not be found within the self-defence regime, but beyond the military paradigm that underpins the focus on self-defence. Hence, in the following section, two other legal concepts are analysed which, alongside self-defence, are listed as circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: countermeasures and necessity.\n## 3. Beyond the Military Paradigm: Countermeasures and Necessity ## 3.1 Countermeasures ## 3.1.1 Function and Preconditions of Countermeasures The first remedy apart from self-defence for a State which finds itself under attack through cyberspace is to resort to a countermeasure. According to Article 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, ‘[t]he wrongfulness of an act of a State not in ⁴² Green, 2009, op cit., 169 et seq.\n⁴³ Conference proposal, cited by Ziolkowski, 2012, *Ius ad bellum* in Cyberspace - Some Thoughts on the ‘Schmitt-Criteria’ for Use of Force, in Ziolkowski et al. (ed.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict – Proceedings, Tallinn, 295, 307; Ziolkowski mentions the Stuxnet attack, which involved command and control servers located in countries such as Denmark and Malaysia, States that were clearly wholly unaware of the operation.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State'. Countermeasures may be defined as 'pacific unilateral reactions which are intrinsically unlawful, which are adopted by one or more States against another State, when the former considers that the latter has committed an internationally wrongful act which could justify such a reaction'.44 The function of such measures under the current state of international law is twofold. Firstly, as described by Article 22, they act as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the deliberately chosen conduct of a State that would otherwise be contrary to its international obligations and hence trigger its responsibility. At the same time countermeasures are a means of triggering the responsibility of the adversary State.45 As such, they are appropriately described as 'law enforcement measures which consist of a temporary dispensation from complying with the law'.46 International practice confirms the existence of countermeasures as circumstances precluding the wrongfulness of otherwise unlawful conduct,47 and in its Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ formulated certain preconditions found in customary law48 that are echoed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in Chapter II of Part Three.\nFor countermeasures to be considered lawful, Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles stipulates that the 'injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations'. This phrasing principally implies two restrictions. First, countermeasures must be aimed at a State that has committed an act that is unlawful under international law. In this sense, countermeasures are akin to self-defence: the determination of a legally responsible actor is a necessary condition of any countermeasure. The main difference is that, unlike self-defence where the other State's unlawful act is predetermined as an 'armed attack', the instrument of countermeasures is valid in response to any wrongful conduct in relation to which it only permits non-forcible responses. It also follows that the countermeasures 'must be directed against that State'.49 Furthermore, the provision implies the permitted goal of resorting to countermeasures: the conduct must attempt to achieve the responsible State's compliance with the respective obligations and be strictly necessary to that end, that is, the cessation of unlawful conduct.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention Countermeasures may not, therefore, be employed in order to punish the adversary.50 However, the commentary to Rule 9 of the Tallinn Manual notes that State practice is ambiguous in this regard, as States ‘sometimes appear to be motivated by punitive considerations when resorting to countermeasures’.51 In any case, to achieve the goal of restoration of compliance, the injured State is under no obligation to resort to means that ‘mirror the underlying wrongful act against which they are directed’.52 There might be good arguments in favour of a concept of reciprocity with regard to the necessity and proportionality requirements,53 but the ILC rightly observes that ‘a limitation to reciprocal countermeasures assumes that the injured State will be in a position to impose the same or related measures as the responsible State, which may not be so’.54 As explained below, this assessment is particularly relevant in the cyber context.\nArticle 50 enumerates certain definite restrictions on countermeasures: they ‘shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law’. So whatever the circumstances of a single case, some superior values of the international legal system may not be impaired by the State that resorts to the instrument.55 This unambiguous wording notwithstanding, there is a persistent debate surrounding the question of the use of force in legal doctrine and international jurisprudence. In his separate opinion to the ICJ’s *Oil Platforms* decision, Judge Simma famously held that ‘the permissibility of strictly defensive military action taken against attacks [that remain below the threshold of Article 51 of the UN Charter] cannot be denied’.56 He considered such actions ‘proportionate counter-measures’ in reference to a part of the Court’s judgments on the merits of the Nicaragua case, where the ICJ had held that ‘[w]hile an armed attack would give rise to an entitlement to collective self-defence, a use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot [...] produce any entitlement to take collective countermeasures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused [...] could only have justified proportionate countermeasures on the part of the State which had been the victim of State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace these acts [...]\".57 Beyond such ‘strictly defensive military action’ as advanced by Simma, the possibility of lawful countermeasures employing the use of force cannot be found in State practice in the Charter era since 1945,58 though as late as 2002, the matter was regarded as ‘controversial’.59 Irrespective of whether or not Simma’s argument is in itself a defensible interpretation of the Nicaragua judgment and of State practice,60 this issue might in any case gain new relevance within the cyber context.\nAccording to Article 51 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which is considered to reflect customary international law,61 countermeasures must also be in line with the principle of proportionality or, in the provision’s wording, ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question’. Just as in other contexts, the proportionality principle ‘is intended to act as a brake on escalating cycles of transactional violence’.62 The judgment on the question of proportionality is, of course, not static but flexible; one that ‘can at best be accomplished by approximation’,63 incorporating considerations of principle as well as material factors.64 Hence, not only ‘quantitative’ elements determine proportionality, but also ‘qualitative’ considerations,65 including ‘the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach’.66 Procedural questions conditioning the execution of countermeasures are dealt with in Article 52. Before starting to take countermeasures an injured State must, according to the first paragraph, ‘call upon the responsible State [...] to fulfil its obligations under Part Two’. Apart from that, the injured State must also ‘notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’, Article 52(1)(b).\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention Those are cumulative conditions, the second following the first.⁶⁷ In cases of urgency, however, the injured State may take those measures that are ‘necessary to preserve its rights’, an exception to the abovementioned paragraph 1(b) as stipulated by paragraph 2 of the same Article. Furthermore, according to the third paragraph, countermeasures ‘may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the internationally wrongful act has ceased, and the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties’. Finally, due to their purely instrumental character, countermeasures are necessarily time-limited,⁶⁸ which inter alia entails the duty to terminate the measure ‘as soon as the responsible State has complied with its obligations under Part Two in relation to the internationally wrongful act’, as prescribed by Article 53 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The inherent limitation in time also entails the ‘fundamental condition’⁶⁹ to choose such countermeasures that are reversible, as already noted by the ICJ.⁷⁰ The ILC qualified the Court’s strict wording insofar as it stipulated that countermeasures ‘must be as far as possible reversible in their effects’,⁷¹ thus reasonably envisaging that complete reversibility will not always be realistic or even possible. More precisely, in the view of the ILC, Article 49(3) merely obliges the injured State to select the measure that is reversible, ‘if [it] has the choice between a number of lawful and effective countermeasures’.⁷² ## 3.1.2 Countermeasures in Response to Cyber Attacks When countermeasures are being considered as unilateral remedies against cyber attacks, different scenarios that each require a different and distinct legal assessment are possible. Hitherto, when commentators took into account countermeasures within cyber attack scenarios, they were mostly motivated by the awareness that not every malicious cyber activity would reach the threshold of an armed attack pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁷³ The same can be said about statements by State representatives.⁷⁴ What ⁶⁷ Kamto, 2010, The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures, in Crawford et al.

The frequently mentioned offensive tools in this regard are so-called ‘active defences’ which, as opposed to ‘passive defences’ are: proactive measure[s] for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber-intrusion, cyber-attack, or impending cyber operation, or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber-counter operation against the source.76 In other words, ‘active defences’ are ‘in-kind response[s] [...] against the attacker’s system’77 in order to offensively ‘disable the source of an attack’.78 To their proponents, the advantage of such active defences within the analysed context is that those are logically reciprocal. While reciprocity is not a precondition for the lawfulness of countermeasures, the ILC in reference to the Air Service Agreement arbitration79 nonetheless holds that ‘[c]ountermeasures are more likely to satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality if they are taken in relation to the same or a closely related obligation’.80 The main problem with countermeasures is that, as with self-defence, the remedy is dependent on the attribution of wrongful conduct; the wrongful conduct here not being an armed attack, but rather a cyber attack which violates other international norms such as the prohibition of the use of force pursuant to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (without reaching the armed attack threshold), or the customary principle of non-intervention. If attribution in order to establish State responsibility of the alleged attacker State is again a precondition, it follows that the same evidentiary standard applies as outlined above.81 As a consequence, the victim State is confronted with the same legal and factual problems when attempting to establish a legal basis for reacting with active defences.\nContrary to what has been argued by some authors,82 this conclusion is not altered by the consideration that, in most instances, what the State would actually resort to in Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention such an emergency situation are so-called ‘urgent countermeasures’ as described by Article 52(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.⁸³ Indeed, it has been argued that ‘international law [...] appears to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in a State’s determination’,⁸⁴ which in turn means that ‘the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured State resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures’.⁸⁵ However, while according to the wording of Article 52, ‘the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights’, this expressly only exempts it from the obligation detailed in Article 52(1)(b) to ‘[n]otify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures and offer to negotiate with that State’. Thus, what is altered in situations of urgency is only a procedural requirement, not the evidentiary standard required to be able to resort to this remedy in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that States have a broader discretion when it comes to taking countermeasures in emergency situations triggered by cyber attacks. After all, ‘[u]rgent countermeasures are nothing but a form of countermeasures in an urgent situation, and their necessity must be shown in a precise manner’.⁸⁶ As countermeasures inherently bear the risk of escalating a dispute, when one of the procedural safeguards is abandoned to take urgency into account it becomes even more crucial that the acting State has ascertained the facts that are relied upon as the legal basis for its conduct. It follows that to directly attribute a cyber attack in order to justify active countermeasures is just as difficult as establishing such a link in situations where the initial malicious cyber operation amounted to an armed attack.\nUnlike self-defence, responsibility for the attack itself is not the only possible legal link under which countermeasures may be justified. As countermeasures are considered a means of self-help that aim to induce a State responsible for any internationally wrongful act to comply with its international obligations according to Article 49(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the relevant act (or omission) can also be of a secondary nature. As pointed out by several scholars, countermeasures may thus also be feasible against violations of a legal duty to prevent cyber attacks. The starting point of this conclusion is the consideration that every State has an active duty to prevent cyber attacks against other States that emanate from its own territory.⁸⁷ In this context, it should be noted that if a State attempts to justify the employment of active defences as countermeasures as a response to an actual cyber attack, then such a legal constellation ⁸³ Krieger, *op. cit.*, 16.\n⁸⁴ Hinkle, *op. cit.*, 17.\n⁸⁵ *Ibid.*, 18 (emphasis added); see also Elagab, 1988, *The Legality of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in International Law*, Oxford, 50.\n⁸⁶ Iwasawa &amp; Iwatsuki, 2010, *Procedural Conditions, in Crawford et al.

In its recent *Pulp Mills* decision,[88] the ICJ referred to its earlier case law[89] in order to determine that the principle of prevention is 'a customary rule' that 'has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory'.[90] According to the Court, this means that '[a] State is [...] obliged to use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.'[91] While this judgment was concerned with environmental issues – the subject matter going back at least to the Trail Smelter arbitration[92] – a duty to prevent harm to other States has been established on a more general scale in international law. In particular, since 1945, the principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, where it was held that every State is under an 'obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.[93] The doctrine eventually gained further momentum with the (re-)emergence of non-State violence in the second half of the 20th century, in particular with the rise of transnational terrorism.[94] In 1999 and 2000, the UN Security Council demanded that the Taliban, then Afghanistan's government, abstain from allowing the territory under its control to be used as a basis for terrorist training and planning by Al Qaeda,[95] a specific manifestation of the duty to prevent which was reiterated and reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US.[96] Early on, there were attempts to translate this established principle of a 'duty to prevent' into the cyber realm. In 2000, the UN General Assembly urged States to ensure that 'their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention information technologies'.97 The recently completed Tallinn Manual expressly applies the Corfu Channel standard to cyber security matters by framing the rule that '[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States'.98 Still, while there might in fact remain little doubt that such an obligation is to be considered as reflecting the current state of customary international law, the rule's specific content is much less clear. As confirmed by the ICJ in Pulp Mills, the 'duty to prevent' finds its roots in, and is more specifically detailed by, a State's due diligence obligations towards other States. Thus, to determine whether a State has violated its duty to prevent a cyber attack against another State, those due diligence obligations must be spelled out. For the time being, it may be sufficient to follow the ICJ's decision in the Tehran Hostages case that, at least when a State positively knows of acts on or emanating from its territory that adversely and unlawfully affect the rights and legally protected interests of another State, it is under a specific duty to 'take appropriate steps' in order to prevent harm if it has 'the means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations'.99 That does not necessarily mean that a State has to guarantee that it is able to control every activity within its territory, as was already confirmed by an arbitral tribunal as early as 1925.100 Instead, such obligations can only be framed as 'best efforts obligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur'.101 In the words of the ICJ, the duty to prevent is an obligation of conduct, not of result.102 Whatever the exact standard of due diligence is in detail as regards the specific situation at hand, when a State is aware of impending harm and has the means at its disposal to prevent it from occurring and yet remains inactive, it may subsequently be held responsible for its violation of the duty to prevent.\nThe issue of the exact content of the duty to prevent cyber attacks notwithstanding, the argument under scrutiny is not without further pitfalls. Even if some of the evidentiary issues obstructing the self-defence justification may be avoided when focusing on a State's duty to prevent cyber attacks, the countermeasures approach still faces two considerable, closely interrelated problems that may not be ignored. At first, it follows from the above that a State that is the victim of a cyber attack needs to be able to show two things with clear and convincing evidence: that the attack emanated from the territory State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace of the accused State, and that the State failed in its due diligence obligations under the duty to prevent the attack. Proving the territory of origin might be less problematic than additionally having to establish which individual carried out the attack, but under the conditions of cyberspace this still remains anything but an easy task. Establishing a territorial link to a convincing degree means tracing back the malicious data, and in the words of a technical expert on the issue, ‘there is still no “silver bullet” in the hunt for the attackers’. A majority of authors maintains that it is essentially ‘impossible to prove’ that a State tolerates cyber attacks against other States emanating from its own territory. Even scholars who principally argue in favour of employing active defences acknowledge that the success rate of trace programs is not only imperfect, but is in fact ‘inherently limited’, so the possibility of incorrect identification of the true source of an attack remains high.\nThis scholarly assessment is frequently obscured by news reports that suggest otherwise. In May 2013, in a much-noticed annual report to Congress, the US Department of Defense maintained that of the numerous intrusions that had targeted government computers in 2012, 'some [...] appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'.[107] Besides China, Iran was also openly accused of having conducted or at least tolerated cyber attacks against the US. In the same month, US officials claimed that malicious intrusions into the security control systems of US power companies had been 'unmistakeably' traced back to Iran.[108] While it is virtually impossible to assess the value of the mostly undisclosed evidence linking the attacks to these States, it appears likely that what eventually led to these conclusions was a process not of technical but of 'all-source attribution': a comprehensive approach 'that integrates information from all sources, not just technical sources at the scene of the attack',[109] including intelligence or political sources. For political purposes, this sort Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention of attribution may be sufficient, but the same can hardly be said in establishing legal responsibility as long as clear and convincing technical evidence is absent. Ultimately, there remains crucial doubt whether the gathering of such circumstantial evidence can ever lead to truly conclusive results. As regards countermeasures, despite all reports and official statements that imply the contrary, 'definitely attributing' cyber incidents and violations of international law related thereto is still one of the 'greatest strategic challenges regarding cyber threats'. \nThere may well be cases where identification of territory of origin and thus the establishment of responsibility for a violation of the duty to prevent are in fact possible. However, what again needs to be brought into the equation is the factor of time; this issue is crucial not only as regards self-defence, but also for the employment of countermeasures. According to the prevalent view, the remedy of resorting to countermeasures is strictly instrumental, and not permitted as a means to retaliate. As a consequence, countermeasures are not allowed once the unlawful act has ceased.\nA different assessment might be tenable when a State is dealing not with a single attack, but rather with a malicious cyber campaign or a continuous attack rather than a one-off intrusion. In such instances, countermeasures might become useful tools in future cyber security matters. While the violation of the duty to prevent an attack is by itself not an omission extending in time within the meaning of Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the breach of the international obligation may well become continuous when one or more attacks have already occurred, but the territorial State has not implemented any measures to prevent further instances. In accordance with Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, an internationally wrongful act is also to be considered 'continuing' for the purpose of these regulations 'where a State has violated an obligation on a series of occasions, implying the possibility of further repetitions'.[113] This connection had already been implied by the ICJ in the Tehran Hostages case[114] and also applies to wrongful omissions according to the arbitral tribunal that decided the Rainbow Warrior case.[115] Thus, if a series of cyber attacks State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace occurs over a period of time, the chance of being able to obtain sufficient evidence – technical and otherwise – after each instance in order to identify the territory of origin is significantly increased. In such a case, it is not unreasonable to assume that a countermeasure short of the use of force might be launched early enough to meet the requirement of countermeasures to be a strictly instrumental, and not retaliatory tool at the State's disposal. These constrains leave that particular remedy with a considerably limited scope of application.\nProponents of the so-called ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine attempt to apply a corresponding rationale to the justification of measures that employ force under self-defence.[116] Although not always made explicit, the doctrine is split into two conceptually different subsets. In the first, either unwillingness or inability lead to the attribution of the armed attack itself, in which case self-defence would be allowed against the territorial State.[117] Here, the argument runs parallel to the one applied to countermeasures above. In the second and seemingly more prevalent view, unwillingness and inability merely lead to the duty of the State to accept and tolerate self-defence measures on its territory conducted directly against the responsible non-State actors.[118] However, this variant struggles to explain the origin of the territorial State’s obligation.[119] Disregarding the question of the current status of the doctrine under international law,[120] Tams convincingly argues that the former alternative is the one reflected in contemporary State practice as regards terrorism, as it: suggests that a territorial State has to accept anti-terrorist measures of self-defence directed against its territory where it is responsible for complicity in the activities of terrorists based on its territory – either because of its support below the level of direction and control or because it has provided a safe haven for terrorists.[121] While far from the ‘Nicaragua standard’ of attribution, this is still a considerably higher threshold than mere ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’, and thus is more than a violation of a due diligence obligation that might lead to the permissibility of countermeasures short of the use of force. Applying the argument to the cyber security framework, it still seems that to obtain ‘clear and convincing’ evidence for the identification both of the actor and of State involvement will only rarely be possible, even if it cannot be Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention ruled out in principle. This assessment would change if one additionally accepts the closely related ‘accumulation of events’ doctrine, which asserts that a series of minor incidents taken together might amount to an armed attack.¹²² This argument alludes to the continuation of wrongful conduct pursuant to Article 30(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in connection to countermeasures. However, while this concept is clearly applicable to violations of due diligence obligations, justifying the employment of countermeasures,¹²³ it would be logically invalid to infer from this that a series of attacks not amounting to an armed attack cumulatively reach the armed attack threshold. In fact, it is more persuasive to reject the doctrine on its own terms with the argument that it ‘undermines the temporal dimension of self-defence and risks turning a temporal right into an open-ended licence to use force’.¹²⁴ Coming back to countermeasures, if so-called active defences are taken into account as possible actions to be taken and justified as countermeasures, further legal issues need to be considered. Active defences involve the employment of potentially harmful code aimed at the attacker, or even the plain ‘mirroring’ of malicious data back towards its source. As already pointed out by several authors, such action might lead to an uncontrollable threat of malicious code,¹²⁵ endangering previously uninvolved third parties. The ILC maintains the view that affecting third parties does not necessarily render a countermeasure unlawful. While it is clear that ‘[c]ountermeasures may not be directed against States other than the responsible State’,¹²⁶ ‘[t]his does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect the position of third States or indeed other third parties [...], as indirect or collateral effects cannot be entirely avoided’.¹²⁷ However, it has reasonably been suggested that whatever the circumstances of a given situation, a State which resorts to countermeasures is under an obligation to take every possible measure to avoid affecting third parties, or, if injury is inevitable, to ensure that the impact is kept to the minimum.¹²⁸ Yet, the question remains of how to define ‘incidentally’ in this context. More precisely, what degree of due diligence is required of the State that resorts to active defences as countermeasures against a cyber attack? At least in situations in which a defending State is aware of the fact that the active cyber defence cannot be designed in such a way as to not inevitably spread uncontrollably into the systems of innocent third parties, causing material loss, the response has to be considered unlawful in relation to the third State, triggering international responsibility ¹²² Ibid, 388.\n¹²³ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 30, at para. 3.\n¹²⁴ Tams, 2009, op. cit., 389; a more thorough discussion of these issues regarding self-defence is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n¹²⁵ Roscini, op. cit., 114; Hathaway et al., op. cit., 859.\n¹²⁶ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 49, at para. 4.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., at para. 5.\n¹²⁸ Elagab, op cit., 113.\nPART III State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace towards it.¹²⁹ The same principle arguably applies when the incidental damage is merely foreseeable.\nA similar issue emerges with regard to human rights. Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility explicitly stipulates that ‘[c]ountermeasures shall not affect obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights’. As countermeasures by definition concern State-to-State relations, the provision intends to prevent is an incidental, consequential impact on those human rights that are considered particularly important.¹³⁰ In order to clarify the norm, the ILC refers in its Commentaries to a General Comment by the Committee on Economic and Social Rights,¹³¹ which in view of economic sanctions installed by international organisations stressed that ‘[i]n considering sanctions, it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing élite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country’,¹³² and that ‘whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’.¹³³ The same rationale ought to be applied to the employment of countermeasures.¹³⁴ Thus, the provision intends to generally restrict the adoption of countermeasures that have the consequence of detrimentally affecting fundamental human rights, both intended and unintended.¹³⁵ Here, just as with the collateral impairment of the rights of third States, the determining rule can only be that a State which is resorting to countermeasures is under the obligation to respect human rights – especially those of the target State’s civilian population – as far as possible.¹³⁶ Applied to the cyber context, the question is whether certain active defences can possibly be designed in such a way as to not automatically run the risk of seriously impairing those rights due to the very high probability of spreading uncontrollably. As noted by Hinkle,¹³⁷ at least simple mirroring of an ongoing DDoS attack can hardly be controlled in such a way as to minimise heavy risks for civilian infrastructure in the target country. As a consequence, it appears doubtful whether such conduct can ever meet the requirement of Article 50(1)(b). Caltagirone and Frincke ¹²⁹ With the same conclusion also Hathaway et al., *op. cit.*, 859.\n¹³⁰ See Crawford, 2001, Introduction to the ILC Commentaries, Cambridge, 50.\n¹³¹ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 50, at para. 7.\n¹³² CESCR, General Comment 8, The relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights, UN Doc E/C.12/1997/8, 12 December 1997, at para. 4.\n¹³³ *Ibid.*, at para. 1.\n¹³⁴ ILC Articles, Commentaries, Article 50, at para. 7.\n¹³⁵ Borelli/Olleson, 2010, Obligations Relating to Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, in Crawford et al.

A by-product of active response could be an increase of threat to critical systems, to be used as shields from active responses.'[138] In other words, there is a considerable danger that once the active cyber defence scheme is widely employed and known among adversaries, perpetrators might well be inclined to route attacks through sensitive systems in order to significantly increase the costs of otherwise likely lawful countermeasures.[139] The third matter particularly critical as regards the employment of active defences as countermeasures is proportionality, mainly as a consequence of the same deliberation as outlined in connection to third States and human rights. Hinkle reasonably observes that while active defences are to be considered reciprocal countermeasures – thus in principle more easily satisfying the proportionality requirement according to the ILC – ‘there is no guarantee that these reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect’. This is certainly true as regards pure numbers – a counterattack targeted at a larger network is likely to affect more computers. However, it has already been pointed out that quantitative deliberations do not suffice when assessing proportionality, as asserted by the arbitral tribunal in the Air Services Agreement case. When taking into account qualitative considerations, disproportionate results might well occur when the employment of active defences hits critical or otherwise sensitive infrastructure in the target State, in a worst-case scenario even leading to civilian casualties. However, while it appears correct to consider such an outcome as not meeting the proportionality requirement, it is also an obvious breach of Article 50(1)(b) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Such conduct cannot therefore be justified, and again suggests that there is a risk inherent in the very concept of active defences that hints at this possibility.\nThe issue of reversibility needs to be tackled briefly. Pursuant to Article 49(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, countermeasures must be executed in such a way as to 'permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question', which amounts to an obligation to limit conduct to means that are reversible as far as possible. The underlying rationale is the concept of strict instrumentality of the remedy: countermeasures may only be invoked in order to achieve 'compliance by the target State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace State with its international obligations of cessation and reparation’,¹⁴⁵ which means that they can only be ‘justified [...] insofar as they continue to be necessary to that end’.¹⁴⁶ When active cyber defences are employed against the source of the attack, this aspect could turn out to be critical. At least it seems to follow from the principle that the source must not be disabled permanently, and defenders would be under a legal duty to ensure that no damage is caused by the counterattack that cannot be reversed. Therefore, under the regime of countermeasures, ‘highly aggressive measures intended to inflict the same kind of damage on the attacker that he or she is attempting to inflict on the victim’,¹⁴⁷ or ‘damaging the perpetrator’s system to stop it from launching future attacks’¹⁴⁸ cannot be considered justifiable. Such intensive conduct might be justified in genuine situations of self-defence if all preconditions are met, but the requirement of reversibility would prevent a justification as a countermeasure. The Tallinn Manual seems to acknowledge this difficulty when asserting that ‘actions involving the permanent disruption of cyber functions should not be undertaken in circumstances where their temporary disruption is technically feasible and would achieve the necessary effect’.¹⁴⁹ However, it is at least doubtful whether permanent damage could be legal at all, disregarding the question of the availability of less harmful means.\nA different matter is the issue of loss of functionality triggered, for instance, by the unavailability of targeted systems during the counterattack. Crawford argued that ‘whereas a measure may be reversible (assets can be unfrozen, civil aviation can be resumed) its effects while it was in force will rarely be entirely reversible, since consequential losses will have been suffered, by the target State and by third parties.’¹⁵⁰ Such losses are precisely envisaged with the notion that the effects of countermeasures should be reversible ‘as far as possible’. Consequences of such a purely secondary nature – of course only as long as they are not disproportionate or in conflict with fundamental human rights – will not preclude the lawfulness of active defences as countermeasures, even if they turn out to be of a permanent nature.\nIt should be noted that this chapter focuses on the employment of active defences that are to be justified as countermeasures, because academic and political debate so far has mainly revolved around this issue. Of course, countermeasures can just as well assume an entirely different, more traditional shape, such as economic pressure or the suspension of a bilateral obligation in order to urge the other State to comply with ¹⁴⁵ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 331.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ Dittrich/Himma, 2005, Active Response to Computer Intrusions, in Bidgoli (ed.), The Handbook of Information Security, Hoboken, 664, 679.\n¹⁴⁸ Sklerov, op. cit., 25.\n¹⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 9, para. 6.\n¹⁵⁰ Crawford, Third Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 3, A/CN.4/507/Add.3, 18 July 2000, at para. 330.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention its duty to prevent cyber attacks. Arguably, this role of countermeasures in the cyber security context might even become the more prevalent one in the long run.\nAs with self-defence, countermeasures have the potential to play a role within the transnational cyber security framework. Some of the intricate and in fact insurmountable attribution issues are the same, while some may be avoided if the duty to prevent cyber attacks is taken into consideration. Compared to self-defence, non-forcible countermeasures arguably are less likely to entail a dangerous escalation of conflict. However, attempting to justify active cyber defences as countermeasures, as favoured by several scholars and practitioners, appears to be problematic on various grounds and, in the majority of cases, those legal restrictions will effectively prevent the lawful employment of this remedy. Therefore, countermeasures will most likely be more significant beyond considerations of pure instant protection against imminent or on-going cyber attacks. In particular, where a State demonstrably and continuously fails to abide by its obligations to prevent harm on other States, counter-measures other than active defences and cyber measures, could be used to enforce international law.\n## 3.2 Necessity If self-defence and countermeasures are both legally problematic as readily available unilateral remedies against cyber attacks due to the problems of sufficiently assured identification and thus attribution, what may also come into focus is the legal notion of necessity. Under such a situation, a State may invoke the existence of a state of emergency in order to undertake measures that otherwise would be unlawful. As a matter of principle, under such conditions the question is not who or what caused the situation, but only what is necessary in order to avert the danger or mitigate the harm caused by the situation. Thus, the issue of attribution is circumvented. Indeed, there need not be an intentionally harmful act in the first place: imminent hazard caused by altered or failing systems could just as well be an accidental consequence of entirely lawful conduct originating on another State's territory. The doctrine of necessity would be applicable in any case.\nAlthough listed in the same section of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as self-defence and countermeasures as one of the 'circumstances precluding wrongfulness', necessity is structurally different and in fact hardly at all comparable with the other two. The two concepts analysed above are remedies in the strict sense, also serving the purpose of enforcing international law that transcends the mere function of justification of otherwise internationally wrongful conduct. For self-defence, this is at least true to some degree; for countermeasures, this aspect is one of the central features and thus generally acknowledged. To 'resort' to necessity can only mean to invoke a truly exceptional circumstance that in this very specific factual situation may be considered sufficiently significant that the conduct in question will, by way of absolute exception, not be deemed a violation of international law triggering the acting State's responsibility.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace Necessity, at least as envisaged by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, is thus hardly a legal ‘tool’ suitable for serving as a strategy to counter cyber threats. In fact, necessity is considered so different that some commentators during the Articles’ drafting process suggested that necessity could merely act as an ‘excuse’, but not as a ‘justification’ of wrongful conduct, even if the outcome in both instances is the absence of responsibility.^[151]^ Still, it seems worthwhile to analyse the preconditions of Article 25 with respect to cyber attacks in order to assess whether and if so, to what *a priori* limited degree necessity could play a role within the cyber security framework. More precisely, if the employment of active defences is technically and politically considered to be a useful tool against cyber attacks, the question arises whether such intrusive measures – that at least *prima facie* would seem to violate the customary principle of non-intervention – could be justified under Article 25 in situations where sufficient identification of the author is unobtainable.\nAlthough controversial during the drafting process^[152]^ and occasionally still called into question,^[153]^ today it is generally acknowledged that Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law.^[154]^ According to the text of the norm: [n]ecessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community a whole.

The main reason for this caution on the part of the ILC is a history of severe abuses of the doctrine.¹⁵⁵ The requirements for an invocation to be accepted are accordingly strict. First, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake, which must be in ‘grave and imminent peril’. Which interests may be considered essential cannot be predetermined; however, international practice shows a wide range of concerns, for instance the environment,¹⁵⁶ grave difficulties as regards a State’s financial obligations,¹⁵⁷ and the protection of a State’s civilian population from terrorist attack.¹⁵⁸ Translated to the cyber context, it seems reasonable to assume that at least the protection of critical infrastructure would be accepted as such an essential interest, and recent statements by various States and international organisations point into that direction. Defined as ‘structures and functions which are indispensable for the vital functions of society’,¹⁵⁹ virtually all national cyber security strategy papers underline the protection of critical infrastructure as one of the principal goals of any cyber security efforts.¹⁶⁰ Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual directly links those assets to the notion of a situation of necessity by asserting that ‘if faced with significant cyber operations against a State’s critical infrastructure, the plea of necessity could justify a State’s resort to counter-hacking’.¹⁶¹ Therefore, the qualification of critical infrastructure as an essential interest appears sufficiently verified.\n¹⁵⁵ Heathcote, 2010, Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: Necessity, in Crawford et al.

While the State is not required for to prove that the peril 'would certainly have occurred',[162] it needs to be 'objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible'.[163] This matter is of course essentially context-specific. As for imminence, it seems beyond doubt that at least an ongoing cyber attack such as a persistent DDoS attack which targets critical infrastructure would satisfy the requirement. At the other end of the spectrum, once an attack has definitely come to an end, a situation of necessity no longer exists.[164] In this sense, the so-called 'accumulation of events' doctrine occasionally invoked in order to justify unilateral measures of self-defence in reaction to a number of small-scale attacks each not reaching the armed attack threshold is not applicable per se to the context of necessity.[165] As noted by Laursen, '[t]he necessity response is an emergency response to deal with the immediate grave peril at hand, not the five previous attacks during the past six months in addition to the imminent attack'.[166] Apart from such clear cases, the technical peculiarities of cyberspace may make it enormously difficult in certain situations to determine whether a threat looms that is already sufficiently imminent for a certain action to be justified under necessity. For instance, does the detection of a security breach in a critical system warrant active defensive measures directed against the purported source of the cyber operation? Note once again that it might be almost impossible to establish whether the infiltration of alien code was carried out for espionage or destructive purposes.[167] In case of the former, there may arguably be no peril within the meaning of Article 25 at all. In case of the latter, the security breach might even be the penultimate step before the launching of a final, potentially disastrous attack.[168] Such a situation is not characterised by 'uncertainty' as envisaged by Crawford, which, if at hand, should not 'disqualify a State from invoking necessity',[169] but by 'indeterminacy', as argued by Foster, due to Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention the fact that it is still an individual who must decide to carry out the final step in order to trigger the damaging event: ‘Future human behaviour is commonly indeterminate’, which is why ‘[t]he indeterminacy of [human] actions might preclude the application of the doctrine of necessity’.¹⁷⁰ This conclusion was also implied by the ICJ in its decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project.¹⁷¹ Following this line of argument, unless the initial infiltration implemented a ‘logic bomb’ – which is triggered without further human intervention once certain determining conditions are met – even potentially damaging code would not pose an imminent peril. With regard to self-defence, faced with a corresponding issue the majority of the International Group of Experts at Tallinn argued that the deciding factor should be the so-called ‘last feasible window of opportunity’,¹⁷² meaning that ‘an armed attack becomes imminent at the point that the victim State must act lest it lose the opportunity to defend itself effectively’.¹⁷³ Foster suggests a similar approach concerning necessity, holding that the bottom line should be that ‘harm becomes “imminent” at the point when it appears reasonable for a State invoking necessity to conclude [...] that preventive action must be taken’.¹⁷⁴ As asserted by Crawford, the required standard in this sense can only be the ‘evidence reasonably available at the time’ of the assessment.¹⁷⁵ Thus, factual error would be excused as long as the decision to act was made with due care,¹⁷⁶ which means that the necessity doctrine in this respect operates critically different from both self-defence and countermeasures.\nStill, this rationale will not easily be transferred to cyber attack scenarios. The deliberately narrow scope of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, establishing necessity as an absolute exception, calls for a cautious approach, which means that in the determination of an imminent peril the requirement of due care needs to be taken seriously. In case of doubt, the rule-exception relationship should necessitate that no action be taken. While this conclusion might come across as being far from satisfactory for policy makers, it is a direct consequence of the deliberately narrow scope of the application of necessity. Necessity is only to be invoked in most exceptional circumstances; it is not a substitute for self-defence or countermeasures in cases in which their legal requirements are not fulfilled; rather, as a general rule where the conditions of either self-defence or countermeasures are not met, no unilateral (unlawful) action may be taken and only exceptionally will it be the case that such conduct could be justified on the basis of necessity.\n¹⁷⁰ Foster, 2008, Necessity and Precaution in International Law: Responding to Oblique Forms of Urgency, 23 New Zealand Universities Law Review 265, 282.\n¹⁷¹ ICJ, Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, op. cit., at para. 55.\n¹⁷² Tallinn Manual, op cit., Rule 15, at para. 4.\n¹⁷³ Ibid., at para. 6.\n¹⁷⁴ Foster, 2008, op. cit., 277.\n¹⁷⁵ Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility – Addendum 2, A/CN.4/498/Add.2, 30 April 1999, at para. 289.\n¹⁷⁶ Likewise Krieger, op. cit., 16.\nPART III State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace In any case, for it to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measure chosen to avert the grave and imminent peril must be the only one available. The case law of international courts and tribunals confirms that it is here where most invocations of the principle ultimately fail.[177] This outcome is logically stringent: as long as there are alternatives, a particular measure is not necessary in the strict sense of the term. However, the application of the test has been so strict that it provoked commentators to call it 'essentially meaningless'.[178] Of course, it will frequently be impossible to show counterfactually whether other means would in fact have been available, and this must hold even more true when it comes to cyber security matters. Thus, the only thing that seems entirely clear is that the employment of active defences can only ever be taken into consideration as a last resort. As long as there are other, none-intrusive means available which are sufficient to end the effects of a cyber attack, the invocation of necessity in order to justify active cyber defences is precluded, even if those are more expensive or less convenient to use.\nPursuant to Article 25, besides the preconditions already mentioned, the measure taken must not seriously impair an essential interest of another State, and the acting State is precluded from invoking necessity when it has contributed to the situation of necessity. Finally, reliance on necessity is legally impossible if the international obligation in question excludes this particular justification. As for the question of contribution, the ILC only asserts that its impact on 'the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral'.[179] This is a matter which is hardly specific to the cyber security context. Of course one may ask for instance whether Estonia 'contributed' to the persistent DDoS attacks against it in 2007 when it 'provoked' Russia and its own Russian minority by moving the Soviet monument. Apart from the consideration that the answer to this question can only rationally be that such a kind of contribution that stems from a wholly legal act undertaken within its own domaine réservé cannot preclude a State from invoking necessity when facing a subsequent peril, the example shows that a lot of these issues will concern scenarios situated outside the strict cyber realm. A different matter would be whether one might reasonably argue that a negligently insecure cyber infrastructure which is excessively prone to security breaches might count as a contribution to a hazardous situation in the sense of the norm.\nThe question of the other States' essential interests or those of the international community as a whole is probably more critical in view of the possibility to employ Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention active defences, as envisaged inter alia by the Tallinn Manual. Active cyber defence measures are inherently dangerous, posing the risk of at least incidentally hitting critical cyber infrastructure within the target State. Within the context of necessity, this observation is even more significant, as the latter State's responsibility for the initial attack against the victim State is not relevant for the legal assessment of the measure. Regarding the relevant standard, the ILC rather bluntly asserts that ‘the interest relied on must outweigh all other considerations, not merely from the point of view of the acting State but on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’.[180] This is another deliberately high threshold, erected in order to make reliance on necessity as rarely available as possible. Arguably, in many scenarios it would follow from this that no permanent damage or obstruction of network functionality may ever be inflicted on the target State’s systems under the doctrine of necessity. In order to ‘outweigh all other considerations’ ‘on a reasonable assessment of the competing interests’, only a temporary interruption to stop a malicious signal or data flow from causing further damage within the victim State’s own systems may be justifiable. Only if a certain active defence measure by way of ‘counter hacking’ into the alleged adversary’s systems is capable of ensuring that no further, persistent harm is done, such measure can be a legally valid tool under the concept.\nFurther than the clearly limiting but not absolute statement in the commentary to the Tallinn Manual, according to which ‘[w]hether a State may use force in accordance with the plea of necessity is highly uncertain’,[181] forcible measures can never be justified on the basis of the necessity doctrine.[182] The permission for the use of force, at least if it does not amount to an act of ‘aggression’,[183] under the necessity doctrine has been suggested in the recent past, mostly in connection with humanitarian interventions and counter-terrorism.[184] A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, even if one does not accept that the prohibition of the use of force as such is a peremptory norm of international law,[185] which would mean that it would not State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace already be precluded by way of Article 26 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it seems reasonable to conclude that a forceful protective reaction would inevitably ‘seriously impair the essential interest[s] of the target State concerning respect for its territorial integrity’.¹⁸⁶ Furthermore, and even more strikingly, it might be argued that the UN Charter sets up a legal regime concerning legal uses of force that implicitly excludes the invocation of necessity pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁸⁷ Ultimately, the analysis of necessity in view of cyber security leaves a mixed impression at best. While the issue of identification and attribution is circumvented, the preconditions of Article 25 are intentionally strict to such a degree that it is highly doubtful whether the necessity defence will be available in more than a very few exceptional and rather hypothetical cases that are characterised by very specific circumstances. On the other hand, precisely because attribution is no requirement, the doctrine opens the possibility of serious abuse, an observation that is even more relevant if one takes into consideration that there is a persistent tendency to attempt to justify even the use of force by way of invoking necessity.\nThe general customary defence of necessity as described by Article 25 is by and large not a useful tool within the cyber security context. Notwithstanding this conclusion, and in view of persistent and arguably insurmountable attribution problems, a treaty-based special necessity regime that is tailor-made for specific problems encountered in the cyber context should not be discarded out of hand. Special necessity norms are common in the international plane, either as emergency exceptions within treaties,¹⁸⁸ or as a standalone body of rules concerned with a particular subject. The relationship between the general necessity provision of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the special norms is governed by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that ‘[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law’ – in other words, the latter are *lex specialis*. The most frequently cited example for a standalone regime, even if only rarely – if ever – actually ¹⁸⁶ Thus expressly Rytter, 2001, Humanitarian Intervention without the Security Council: From San Francisco to Kosovo – and Beyond, 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 121, 134 et seq..\n¹⁸⁷ Corten, *op cit.*, 48: ‘Une interprétation du texte de la Charte, tel qu’il a été conçu puis interprété par le biais de plusieurs résolutions adoptées par l’Assemblée générale, confirme que la prohibition du recours à la force représente un régime juridique qui n’admet pas d’échappatoire.’ (emphasis added).\n¹⁸⁸ Sloane, *op cit.*, 454, suggests that the number of such provisions must be ‘hundreds’; see e.g. Article 4(1) ICCPR; Article 15(1) ECHR; Article 27(1) ACHR; Article XXI(b)(iii) GATT; Article XI of the 1991 Treaty Between United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; Article XX(1)(d) of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights Between the United States of America and Iran; Article 221(1) UNCLOS.\n\nFreedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention invoked by a State, is the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (Intervention Convention). Drafted and agreed upon after the disastrous Torrey Canyon oil tanker accident off the Cornish coast in 1967. Although the bombing of the wrecked Liberian-registered tanker by the United Kingdom in order to burn the spilling oil and prevent it from reaching the coast was not justified in legal terms, the action was cited early on as one example for the existence of a customary law defence of necessity. Even though it was not met with legal resistance by other States, in the aftermath of the incident it was quickly deemed necessary to come up with a specific multilateral convention that outlines the exact preconditions and legal consequences of such emergency actions on the high seas, as 'States preferred to establish clear international law on the legal issues arising out of such accidental spills rather than to leave comparable future incidents to the unilateral judgments of affected States'. \nWithout going into detail as regards the exact content of such a legal regime, it is likely that the Intervention Convention may provide a model for a parallel treaty that would govern States' reactions to future hazardous cyber incidents. The more that States and modern societies become reliant on a functioning and unimpeded cyberspace, the more likely it is that cyber incidents, whether accidental or inflicted intentionally, will affect a State's 'essential interests'. Moreover, in the interconnected domain of cyberspace it appears rather likely that a quick-fix solution to the problem that helps to safeguard the interests of one State might affect the interests of another; temporarily degrading cyber traffic to protect one's own systems may affect the systems and/or interests of other States. A treaty specifically focused on large-scale cyber incidents could help to resolve the legal uncertainties resulting from the application of the necessity doctrine in the cyber domain and at the same time help to confine the various risks and incalculability pertaining to the application of the general necessity norm of Article 25.\n\nState Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace # 4. In Search of a More Comprehensive Approach: Spelling Out States' Due Diligence Obligations in Cyberspace So far, the focus of this chapter has been on unilateral protective remedies, invoked by States when faced with an emergency situation caused by a cyber incident. In order to reach a more general state of transnational security in cyberspace, such unilateral measures, though important in their own right, hardly suffice. What is needed at least in the midterm is a more comprehensive approach that complements those remedies, providing a legal framework that spells out the duties of States concerning cyber security more concretely. To be able to phrase such duties, it is necessary to inquire into the precise content of States' due diligence obligations regarding cyberspace, as already hinted at above.^[194]^ As confirmed by the ICJ, 'the obligation to [prevent] is an obligation to act with due diligence in respect of all activities which take place under the jurisdiction and control of each party'.^[195]^ In other words, due diligence serves as the standard for any international duties to prevent certain events from occurring. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.^[196]^ Such standard is necessarily dependant on the context and must therefore be determined for every subject matter specifically, or may even change over time 'in light [...] of new scientific or technological knowledge', as argued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in its 2011 advisory opinion.^[197]^ As regards cyberspace, those obligations can hardly be considered settled.^[198]^ Due diligence is generally understood to require conduct that would be adopted by any reasonable State under the given circumstances.^[199]^ In relation to cyberspace and in view of the relative novelty of this domain (especially as a subject for discussion among States), however, it is often still not fully clear what exactly a reasonable State would do with respect to cyber security. However, analysing more general concepts of due diligence in international law, it may be possible to infer at least some guiding principles to be applied to the cyber security context.\n^[194]^ See para. 3.1.2.\n^[195]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentine v Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, at para. 197; see also at para. 223: '[T]he Court observes that the obligation to prevent [...], and the exercise of due diligence implied in it, [...]' (emphasis added).\n^[196]^ ICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As early as 2000, the UN General Assembly asked States to ensure that ‘their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies’.²⁰¹ Shortly afterwards, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, initiated by the Council of Europe but open to non-Member States,²⁰² required signatory States to undertake measures of prevention by establishing ‘criminal offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber-attack under their domestic laws’.²⁰³ Thus, it may be argued that the due diligence standard at least amounts to the obligation to enact laws that criminalise cyber attacks, and to prosecute the perpetrators when an attack has occurred.²⁰⁴ Directly alluding to earlier ICJ decisions and State practice concerning terrorism, the Tallinn Manual asserts that ‘[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States’.²⁰⁵ The duty to criminalise, which ideally amounts to prevention by deterrence, is necessarily complemented by a more general obligation of vigilance. In this sense, the ICJ held that due diligence is an obligation which entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party.²⁰⁶ While the general principle is certainly defendable, the question is what exactly this means for the cyber context. The Tallinn Group of Experts could not agree whether such a preventative duty exists as regards cyber attacks due to the inherent ‘difficulty State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats'.207 In any case the due diligence standard would not impose an absolute obligation to avoid all attacks and there might thus still be cases – especially when continuous and/or similar attack patterns are at issue – where the State ‘should have known’ of malicious conduct within the networks on its own territory. In its Corfu Channel decision, the ICJ considered such constructive knowledge sufficient for a due diligence violation under certain factual conditions.208 While cyberspace certainly is no waterway that is ‘easily watched’209 and while any potential due diligence obligation would have to be in line with international human rights obligations and not be used as a pretext for censorship and surveillance,210 there are nonetheless scenarios imaginable where a State could have gained information about an imminent or continuously on-going attack, and it thus seems untenable to a priori exclude the possibility of assuming a due diligence obligation of vigilance towards cyber security incidents. The current problem is the determination of the ‘threshold of due care’ in this regard,211 but, in line with the holding of ITLOS, the obligations in this regard could well be altered by new technological developments in the relevant field of cyber security.\nClosely connected with this, several commentators have suggested that the due diligence obligations should encompass an element of precaution.212 In other contexts it has been observed that precaution is an integral part of due diligence.213 For the cyber context, Krieger suggests inter alia that precaution should comprise an obligation on all States and stakeholders to ensure that all relevant systems are always kept up to date in order for cyber security to work properly.214 A corresponding duty has been implied by the ICJ in its Pulp Mills judgment in relation to the safe operation of an industrial plant.215 Furthermore, it appears reasonable to assert that multilateral communication about possible technical failures and security-relevant shortcomings as well as other minor cyber incidents (especially when due to zero-day exploits) should be permanent and mandatory, in order to enable all States to prepare for possible attacks or security Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention breaches.²¹⁶ Concerning both points, recent domestic legislative initiatives point in this direction, attempting to establish the legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to report cyber incidents in order to establish such a dialogue.²¹⁷ In the case of an actual cyber security incident, such as a cyber attack or technical failure of critical cyber infrastructure, the content of due diligence obligations shifts, or rather is expanded. In such a situation, it seems reasonable to assert that the standard implies obligations to cooperate with the victim State in order to prevent further harm or to mitigate the consequences of an incident.²¹⁸ As already mentioned in the context of transnational terrorism, such duties of cooperation have long been acknowledged as an essential part of the due diligence principle. For instance, Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities provides that ‘States concerned shall cooperate in good faith [...] in preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event in minimizing the risk thereof’. Similarly, Article 6(1) of the World Health Organization’s 2005 International Health Regulations obliges Member States to notify the organisation ‘of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within [their territories]’. A duty of this kind could well be translated to the cyber security context, triggered by the event of an incident.²¹⁹ This approach, which primarily aims at prevention rather than repression, is not a panacea for cyber security but is an important stepping stone towards a more comprehensive approach to global cyber security and geo-cyber stability. In a domain where attribution of conduct is inherently difficult if not impossible, a much stronger focus should be placed on the preventive dimension than the repressive dimension, which is borrowed from military responses and the use of force. Establishing due diligence obligations on States to harden their systems and to criminalise data theft and system intrusions as well as other relevant conduct will not help to avert and prevent highly elaborate destructive attacks by powerful actors. It will, however, help to mitigate those State Interaction and Counteraction in Cyberspace threats which make up the vast majority of contemporary threats and – once established and accepted – will make it harder for States that sponsor such activities to blame other actors. At the same time it must be acknowledged that setting up more elaborate and specific due diligence obligations will take time. Domestic legislative approaches towards information sharing and regular security updates, have stirred significant controversy due to the economic costs attached and the fact that information sharing in a security-sensitive area is inherently difficult to achieve. On the inter-State level these problems will certainly be no less relevant.\n# 5. Conclusion For the time being and also likely into the mid-term, with no comprehensive international cyber security treaty or centralised and institutionalised regime-building in sight,²²⁰ unilateral remedies will most likely continue to play a central role when it comes to cyber security incidents. Thus far the academic and political debate has focused too much on military responses to cyber attacks, over-emphasising the self-defence doctrine as the most feasible reaction to malicious inter-State activity. This overemphasis is not only dangerous but also out of touch with reality and the kind of security threats States and societies actually face in cyberspace. To date no cyber security incident has actually risen to the level of an armed attack. Moreover, due to the persisting attribution problem and the myriad uncertainties surrounding tracing the origin of an attack in cyberspace, in most instances it will be legally untenable. In cyberspace, as in the real world, self-defence is an option of last resort.\nThis chapter has attempted to present and analyse alternatives to the military paradigm of cyber security. It has been made clear that both countermeasures and the state of necessity pose unique and very specific legal problems when applied in the context of cyberspace. Some of these problems can be solved; others could at least be mitigated if non-forcible unilateral responses to cyber incidents of unclear origin that affect other State's interest could be better coordinated and ultimately institutionalised on the basis of an international treaty. Certainly, in the long run a cogent path would be a much stronger focus on specifying States' due diligence obligations regarding threat prevention and securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace.\n²²⁰ See on this e.g. Segal/Waxman, 2011, Why a Cybersecurity Treaty Is a Pipe Dream, Council on Foreign Relations, 27 October 2011, available at: http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/why-cybersecurity-treaty-pipe-dream/p26325; Goldsmith, 2011, Cybersecurity Treaties: A Sceptical View, Stanford University, available at: http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf; Jurich, 2008, Cyberwar and Customary International Law: The Potential of a ‘Bottom-up’ Approach to an International Law of Information Operations, 9 Chicago Journal of International Law 275; Lin, 2012, Arms Control in Cyberspace: Challenges and Opportunities, World Politics Review, 6 March 2012, available at: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/print/11683; Maurer, 2011, Cyber Norm Emergence at the United Nations – An Analysis of the UN’s Activities Regarding Cyber-security, Harvard Kennedy School, September 2011, available at: http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21445/cyber_norm_emergence_at_the_united_nationsan_analysis_of_the_uns_activities_regarding_cybersecurity.html.."
