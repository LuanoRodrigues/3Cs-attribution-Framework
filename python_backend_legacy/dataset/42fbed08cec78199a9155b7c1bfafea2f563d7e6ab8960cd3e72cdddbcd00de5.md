Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.¹ After all, States have been attempting to shift, influence and control narratives in other States for ages now. What has changed?\nThe advent of the digital age and the increasingly accessible means to disseminate information simultaneously to an audience of millions of people have considerably changed the rules of the game.

More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention.⁴ A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State.⁵ Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm.⁶ Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n2 Samantha Bradshaw and Philip N Howard, ‘The Global Disinformation Order - 2019 Global Inventory of Organised Social Media Manipulation’ (2019) Oxford Internet Institute Working Paper 2019.2: Project on Computational Propaganda <https: 09=\"\" 19=\"\" 2019=\"\" cjbertroop-report19.pdf=\"\" demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n3 Colonel (Retired) Gary Corn, ‘Punching on the Edges of the Grey Zone: Iranian Cyber Threats and State Cyber Responses’ (Just Security, 11 February 2020) <https: 68622=\"\" punching-on-the-edges-of-the-grey-zone-iranian-cyber-threats-and-state-cyber-responses=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 12 July 2020.\n4 Gary Corn, ‘Coronavirus Disinformation and the Need for States to Shore Up International Law’ (Lawfare, 2 April 2020) <https: coronavirus-disinformation-and-need-states-shore-international-law=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n5 See generally, Harriet Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks: Sovereignty and Non-intervention’ (2019) Chatham House Research Paper <https: 2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" research=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2020.\n6 See generally, Ido Kilovaty, ‘Doxfare: Politically Motivated Leaks and the Future of the Norm</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nthe doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n7 Michael N Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, 47.\n8 Office of the Press Secretary, ‘Statement by the President on Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (The White House, 29 December 2016) <https: 3xxd-8k5c=\"\" perma.cc=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020 (Office of the Press Secretary).\n9 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua. v U.S.) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 14 [202].</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out.¹⁰ Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter.¹¹ Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State.¹² The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States,¹³ chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration').¹⁴ Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.¹⁵\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely.¹⁶ These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law,¹⁷ making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n10 ibid.\n11 Sean Watts, 'Low-Intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-Intervention' (2015) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 137.\n12 M.N.S.

The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n19 Katja S Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé', in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (OUP 2013).\n20 Moynihan (n 5) 34.\n21 Ziegler (n 19).\n22 Kunig (n 17) 3.\n23 Nicaragua (n 9) [205].\n24 Moynihan (n 5) 28.\n25 See for instance, Friendly Relations Declaration (n 14), princ. 3 - 'No State may...coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind.'; see also, Michael N.

The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention.³⁴ ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n26 Tom Hamburger and Karen Tumulty, ‘WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations’ (The Washington Post, 23 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 22=\"\" news=\"\" post-politics=\"\" opi=\"\" opi2016=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" wpr=\"\"></https:> accessed 14 July 2021.\n27 Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin, ‘Democrats Struggle for Unity on First Day of Convention’ (The New York Times, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 26=\"\" us=\"\" points=\"\" politics=\"\" dnc-speakers-protests-sanders.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n28 Dan Roberts, Ben Jacobs and Alan Yuhas, ‘Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Resign as DNC Chair as Email Scandal Rocks Democrats’ (The Guardian, 25 July 2016) <https: 2016=\"\" 24=\"\" debate-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders=\"\" us-news=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n29 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs, ‘Disinformation and Propaganda – Impact on the Functioning of the Rule of Law in the EU and Its Member States’ (2019) Study conducted by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) PE 608.864, 39 <https: 2019=\"\" 608864=\"\" eudata=\"\" eudg=\"\" etudes=\"\" gta=\"\" IPOL_STU(2019)608864_en.pdf=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n30 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n31 ibid.\n32 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs (n 28) 41; See also, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report (HC 2018, 363) para 2.\n33 Gabriel Gatehouse, ‘Marine Le Pen: Who’s funding France’s far right?’ (BBC News, 3 April 2017) <https: news=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n34 See generally, Kilovaty (n 6).</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n35 ibid 152.\n36 ibid 172.\n37 See generally, Schmitt 'Virtual' Disenfranchisement (n 7).\n38 ibid 51.\n39 ibid.\n40 ibid.\n41 Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), Oppenheim's International Law (vol 1, 9th edn, OUP 2008) 432.\n42 Moynihan (n 5) 29.\n43 Nicaragua (n 9) [205].\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n## PART II\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A.

After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule.⁵¹ However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’.⁵² In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.⁵³\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force.⁵⁴ However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.⁵⁵\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n50 Nicaragua (n 9) [205].\n51 ibid [242].\n52 ibid [195].\n53 Brownlie (n 49) 361–368 - ‘There can be little doubt that ‘use of force’ is commonly understood to imply a military attack, an ‘armed attack’, by the organized military, naval, or air forces of a state’; Oona A.

Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n56 Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Peacetime Cyber Espionage – New Tendencies in Public International Law’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), *Peacetime Regime For State Activities In Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations And Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE Publications 2013) 425, 433 - ‘Scholars assert that illegal coercion implies massive influence, inducing the affected state to adopt a decision with regard to its policy or practice which it would not entertain as a free and sovereign state’.\n57 Jennings and Watts (n 41).\n58 Alexander Lanoszka, ‘Disinformation in International Politics’ (2019) 4 European Journal of International Security 227, 233.\n59 ibid.\n60 Lanoszka (n 58).\n61 See Michael N.

In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n62 Jack Stubbs, ‘Hackers hit UK political parties with back-to-back cyberattacks’ (Reuters, 12 November 2019) <https: article=\"\" us-britain-election-labour-cyber-iduskbn1xm19l=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n63 ibid.\n64 ibid.\n65 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 52.\n66 Stubbs (n 62).</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n67 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 51.\n68 ibid.\n69 UNCHR ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression’ (2015) UN Doc A/HRC/29/32 para 16.\n70 Statute of the International Court of Justice (entered into force 18 April 1946) art 38.\n71 Aditi Agrawal and Nikhil Pahwa, ‘Lt Gen.

For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n72 William Yong, 'Iran Denies Malware Connection to Nuclear Delay' (The New York Times, 5 October 2010) <https: 06=\"\" 10=\"\" 2010=\"\" middleeast=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\" world=\"\"> accessed 30 July 2020.\n73 Staff Reporter, 'The Interview: North Korea responsible for 'destructive' Sony hack says FBI' (ABC News, 20 December 2014) <https: 2014-12-20=\"\" news=\"\" north-korea-behind-sony-hack-says-united-states=\"\" 5980794=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.\n74 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n75 See generally, Michael N.

Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’.⁸⁹ The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention.⁹⁰ France’s statement,⁹¹ while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s,⁹² which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’.⁹³ This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule.⁹⁴ A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’.⁹⁵ The document also refers to and supports the\n⁸⁹ Wright (n 79).\n⁹⁰ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n⁹¹ Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n⁹² Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n⁹³ Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n⁹⁴ Government of Australia (n 83).\n⁹⁵ Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n96 ibid 10.\n97 Schöndorf (n 88).\n98 General Staff of Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n99 ibid.\n100 Government of New Zealand (n 87).\n101 ibid.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*.¹⁰² Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants.¹⁰³ The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.¹⁰⁴\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level,¹⁰⁵ if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State.¹⁰⁶ If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n¹⁰² International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n¹⁰³ Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n¹⁰⁴ ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n¹⁰⁶ Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110]\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n107 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, 169.\n108 Nicaragua (n 9) [24], [29], [62], [109].\n109 ibid [195].\n110 See generally, Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285-299.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n129\nwill be vital. Interestingly, apart from disinformation that is especially harmful such as those related to coronavirus and so on, a social media influence campaign (whether State-sponsored or not) can very often violate the platform's own rules or terms of service. Under Facebook's terms of service, this kind of influence operation is called 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour', which according to Facebook, is when 'people...coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing..'.[111] However, ordinarily, Facebook's response to these operations is merely to take down the posts constituting these operations and not investigate further or enquire into details such as whether they are foreign or domestic.[112]\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also\n111 Nathaniel Gleicher, ‘Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior’ (Facebook, 8 July 2020) <https: 07=\"\" 2020=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" removing-political-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 21 August 2020.\n112 ibid.\n113 Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, Russia (HC 2020, 632) para 47.\n114 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 63.\n115 Damien McGuinness, ‘How a cyber attack transformed Estonia’ (BBC News, 27 April 2017) <https: 39655415=\"\" news=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 31 July 2020.\n116 UNGA ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para 27.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace.¹¹⁷ If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.¹¹⁸\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’.¹¹⁹ In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State.¹²⁰ Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.¹²¹\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’.¹²² This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition.¹²³ They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n¹¹⁷ Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n¹¹⁸ Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n¹²⁰ ibid.\n¹²¹ ibid.\n¹²² Wright (n 79).\n¹²³ Gary P.

They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’.¹²⁶ They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’.¹²⁷ As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’.¹²⁸ France¹²⁹ and Iran,¹³⁰ too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage.¹³¹ But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n¹²⁴ ibid 208.\n¹²⁵ ibid 208-209.\n¹²⁶ ibid.\n¹²⁷ ibid.\n¹²⁸ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n¹²⁹ Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n¹³⁰ General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n¹³¹ For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities.¹³² The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.¹³³\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’.¹³⁴ State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people.¹³⁵ It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.¹³⁶ This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.¹³⁷ State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information. The public\n¹³² Tech2 News Staff, ‘ISRO confirms it was alerted about DTrack Malware during Chandrayaan 2, says it had no impact’ (Tech2 News Firstpost, 10 November 2019) <https: isro-confirms-it-was-alerted-about-dtrack-malware-during-chandrayaan-2-says-it-had-no-impact-7626131.html=\"\" tech=\"\" science=\"\" www.firstpost.com=\"\"> accessed 1 September 2020.\n¹³³ Schmitt ‘Tallinn Manual 2.0’ (n 25) 330.\n¹³⁴ Ohlin (n 46).\n¹³⁵ Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 146.\n¹³⁶ International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171 (ICCPR) art 19.\n¹³⁷ Emily Howie, ‘Protecting the Human Right to Freedom of Expression in International Law’ (2018) 20 International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology 12.</https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nundoubtedly has a ‘right to know’, and therefore has a right to receive ‘correct’ information from the State.¹³⁸ However, it is still heavily contested whether this right is owed to the public by the government of another State. Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially,¹³⁹ they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n¹³⁸ ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹³⁹ Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’.¹⁴⁰ The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.¹⁴¹\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus.¹⁴² He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia.¹⁴³ Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n¹⁴⁰ James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴¹ Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴² Corn (n 4).\n¹⁴³ ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n144 Andrew Hayward, ‘How Elon Musk’s Tweets Move the Cryptocurrency Market’ (The Motley Fool, 17 June 2021) <https: 06=\"\" 17=\"\" 2021=\"\" how-elon-musk-s-tweets-move-the-cryptocurrency-mark=\"\" www.fool.com=\"\" investing=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n145 Sneha Saha, ‘Twitter hack: What happened and how Twitter tackled the Bitcoin scam’ (The Indian Express, 18 July 2020) <https: article=\"\" indianexpress.com=\"\" technology=\"\" social=\"\" tether-hacked-what-happened-bitcoin-scam-6508118=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.¹⁴⁶\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook¹⁴⁷ and Twitter¹⁴⁸ have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge.¹⁴⁹ There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default.¹⁵⁰ The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates.¹⁵¹ Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.¹⁵²\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population\n¹⁴⁶ Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁷ ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\" help=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁸ ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁹ ibid.\n¹⁵⁰ Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\" twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\" www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵¹ Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\" twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\" www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵² ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\" gpa=\"\" facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n137\non State-media, both online and offline, means that a successful impersonation or hijacking of their State-media with a view to spread disinformation on an issue such as Covid-19 and vaccination could have catastrophic effects, majorly hindering governmental efforts to handle the Covid crisis and ensure citizens' welfare. Note that the emphasis on trusted sources online including government sources is especially heightened now given the spate of general mis- and dis-information prevailing about the novel coronavirus.\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem.",

Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.

As Colonel Gary Corn, a former Deputy Legal Counsel to the Joint Chief of Staffs of the United States, aptly put it, it is not that information is being weaponized since that has always been the case, but that novel technologies have amplified the impact of this weaponization to a scale that has become difficult to ignore. The Russian electoral interference operations in the United States in 2016 have thrust the issue of the legality of these operations in international law into focus. More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention. A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State. Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm. Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nthe doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out. Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter. Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State. The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States, chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration'). Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely. These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law, making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas. On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninternational law, critiques of the non-intervention rule point to the shrinking sphere of a State's domaine réservé because 'there are hardly any subject-matters or policy areas today that are inherently removed from the international sphere'.[19] A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question.[20] But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé.[21] This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones.[22] 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'.[23] The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention.[24] The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.[25]\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncompromising details including the fact that the DNC favoured Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate, among others. This effectively divided the Democrats, with Sanders' supporters organizing protests against the DNC and ultimately led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC. Additionally, Russian trolls also functioned as agents of polarization by infiltrating left-wing and right-wing groups and posting divisive and controversial content to manipulate public opinion. In December 2016, as President Barack Obama’s term was coming to a close, the White House released a statement that squarely identified Russia as having conducted cyber operations against the US elections. The statement referred to ‘data theft’ and ‘disclosure activities’ by the Russian government that were clear references to the Russian hack and leaking. The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’. Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum, and to some extent in France as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention. ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n## PART II\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A. The Coercion Criterion\nAlthough the drafters of the UN Charter made it clear that outlawing armed force as an instrument of international policy was foremost in their minds,49 proponents of expansive\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterpretation of the intervention norm can point to the acknowledgement by the ICJ in Nicaragua that there could be both direct and indirect forms of intervention as proof that its meaning can evolve. After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule. However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’. In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force. However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nimperative.56 As Oppenheim stated, the intervening State needs to ‘deprive the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’.57 This requirement is still not met through these kinds of disinformation operations. Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference operations. In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nSimilar was the case with Iran's denial that Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon that was found in Iran's nuclear power plant at its Natanz facility, had anything to do with damage to its centrifuges causing a major setback to its nuclear programme.72 Admitting the consequences of, or even the occurrence of a cyber operation could be an admission of weakness, both domestically and internationally.\nEven when States do speak out, their statements often do not lend much clarity to the understanding of international law in cyberspace. For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ntheir views on how international law should apply to cyberspace.77 The mandate of the Open-Ended Working Group requires its member States to submit ‘national contributions’ in an effort to promote a common understanding on these issues.78 Independently, States are also slowly articulating and releasing their views on international law and cyberspace. The United Kingdom,79 the Netherlands,80 France,81 Germany,82 Australia,83 Iran,84 Finland,85 Estonia,86 New Zealand87 and Israel88 are a few examples of States that have released these\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nexplanatory statements so far.\nWhile these official statements are most certainly a positive development which shed some light on States' views on the subject, even their contribution cannot be exaggerated at least as far as the intervention rule is concerned. Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’. The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention. France’s statement, while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s, which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’. This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule. A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’. The document also refers to and supports the\n Wright (n 79).\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n Government of Australia (n 83).\n Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*. Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants. The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level, if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State. If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n ibid.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110]\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace. If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’. In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State. Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’. This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition. They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Wright (n 79).\n Gary P.

Their main argument for this view is that sovereignty is treated differently in different domains and is not applied as a one-size-fits-all rule. They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’. They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’. As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’. France and Iran, too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage. But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n ibid 208.\n ibid 208-209.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities. The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’. State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people. It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.

However, it is still heavily contested whether this right is owed to the public by the government of another State. Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially, they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’. The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus. He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia. Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Corn (n 4).\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook and Twitter have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge. There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default. The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates. Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population\n Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\" help=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ibid.\n Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\" twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\" www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\" twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\" www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\" gpa=\"\" facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem.",

    "## PART I": "### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n7 Michael N Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, 47.\n8 Office of the Press Secretary, ‘Statement by the President on Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (The White House, 29 December 2016) <https: 3xxd-8k5c=\"\" perma.cc=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020 (Office of the Press Secretary).\n9 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua. v U.S.) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 14 .</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out.¹⁰ Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter.¹¹ Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State.¹² The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States,¹³ chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration').¹⁴ Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.¹⁵\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely.¹⁶ These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law,¹⁷ making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n10 ibid.\n11 Sean Watts, 'Low-Intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-Intervention' (2015) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 137.\n12 M.N.S.

A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question. But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé. This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones. 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'. The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention. The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n19 Katja S Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé', in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (OUP 2013).\n20 Moynihan (n 5) 34.\n21 Ziegler (n 19).\n22 Kunig (n 17) 3.\n23 Nicaragua (n 9) .\n24 Moynihan (n 5) 28.\n25 See for instance, Friendly Relations Declaration (n 14), princ. 3 - 'No State may...coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind.'; see also, Michael N.

The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention.³⁴ ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n26 Tom Hamburger and Karen Tumulty, ‘WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations’ (The Washington Post, 23 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 22=\"\" news=\"\" post-politics=\"\" opi=\"\" opi2016=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" wpr=\"\"></https:> accessed 14 July 2021.\n27 Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin, ‘Democrats Struggle for Unity on First Day of Convention’ (The New York Times, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 26=\"\" us=\"\" points=\"\" politics=\"\" dnc-speakers-protests-sanders.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n28 Dan Roberts, Ben Jacobs and Alan Yuhas, ‘Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Resign as DNC Chair as Email Scandal Rocks Democrats’ (The Guardian, 25 July 2016) <https: 2016=\"\" 24=\"\" debate-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders=\"\" us-news=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n29 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs, ‘Disinformation and Propaganda – Impact on the Functioning of the Rule of Law in the EU and Its Member States’ (2019) Study conducted by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) PE 608.864, 39 <https: 2019=\"\" 608864=\"\" eudata=\"\" eudg=\"\" etudes=\"\" gta=\"\" IPOL_STU(2019)608864_en.pdf=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n30 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n31 ibid.\n32 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs (n 28) 41; See also, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report (HC 2018, 363) para 2.\n33 Gabriel Gatehouse, ‘Marine Le Pen: Who’s funding France’s far right?’ (BBC News, 3 April 2017) <https: news=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n34 See generally, Kilovaty (n 6).</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n35 ibid 152.\n36 ibid 172.\n37 See generally, Schmitt 'Virtual' Disenfranchisement (n 7).\n38 ibid 51.\n39 ibid.\n40 ibid.\n41 Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), Oppenheim's International Law (vol 1, 9th edn, OUP 2008) 432.\n42 Moynihan (n 5) 29.\n43 Nicaragua (n 9) .\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47",
    "## PART II": "Clearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.",

After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule.⁵¹ However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’.⁵² In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.⁵³\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force.⁵⁴ However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.⁵⁵\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n50 Nicaragua (n 9) .\n51 ibid .\n52 ibid .\n53 Brownlie (n 49) 361–368 - ‘There can be little doubt that ‘use of force’ is commonly understood to imply a military attack, an ‘armed attack’, by the organized military, naval, or air forces of a state’; Oona A.

Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n56 Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Peacetime Cyber Espionage – New Tendencies in Public International Law’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), *Peacetime Regime For State Activities In Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations And Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE Publications 2013) 425, 433 - ‘Scholars assert that illegal coercion implies massive influence, inducing the affected state to adopt a decision with regard to its policy or practice which it would not entertain as a free and sovereign state’.\n57 Jennings and Watts (n 41).\n58 Alexander Lanoszka, ‘Disinformation in International Politics’ (2019) 4 European Journal of International Security 227, 233.\n59 ibid.\n60 Lanoszka (n 58).\n61 See Michael N.

In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n62 Jack Stubbs, ‘Hackers hit UK political parties with back-to-back cyberattacks’ (Reuters, 12 November 2019) <https: article=\"\" us-britain-election-labour-cyber-iduskbn1xm19l=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n63 ibid.\n64 ibid.\n65 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 52.\n66 Stubbs (n 62).</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.",
    "## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views": "Customary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n67 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 51.\n68 ibid.\n69 UNCHR ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression’ (2015) UN Doc A/HRC/29/32 para 16.\n70 Statute of the International Court of Justice (entered into force 18 April 1946) art 38.\n71 Aditi Agrawal and Nikhil Pahwa, ‘Lt Gen.

For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n72 William Yong, 'Iran Denies Malware Connection to Nuclear Delay' (The New York Times, 5 October 2010) <https: 06=\"\" 10=\"\" 2010=\"\" middleeast=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\" world=\"\"> accessed 30 July 2020.\n73 Staff Reporter, 'The Interview: North Korea responsible for 'destructive' Sony hack says FBI' (ABC News, 20 December 2014) <https: 2014-12-20=\"\" news=\"\" north-korea-behind-sony-hack-says-united-states=\"\" 5980794=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.\n74 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n75 See generally, Michael N.

Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’.⁸⁹ The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention.⁹⁰ France’s statement,⁹¹ while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s,⁹² which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’.⁹³ This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule.⁹⁴ A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’.⁹⁵ The document also refers to and supports the\n⁸⁹ Wright (n 79).\n⁹⁰ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n⁹¹ Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n⁹² Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n⁹³ Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n⁹⁴ Government of Australia (n 83).\n⁹⁵ Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n96 ibid 10.\n97 Schöndorf (n 88).\n98 General Staff of Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n99 ibid.\n100 Government of New Zealand (n 87).\n101 ibid.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.",
    "## C. Difficulties in Attribution": "Even if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*.¹⁰² Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants.¹⁰³ The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.¹⁰⁴\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level,¹⁰⁵ if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State.¹⁰⁶ If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n¹⁰² International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n¹⁰³ Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n¹⁰⁴ ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 3 , .\n¹⁰⁶ Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'. Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4). Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably, and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n107 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 43, 169.\n108 Nicaragua (n 9) , , , .\n109 ibid .\n110 See generally, Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285-299.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n129\nwill be vital. Interestingly, apart from disinformation that is especially harmful such as those related to coronavirus and so on, a social media influence campaign (whether State-sponsored or not) can very often violate the platform's own rules or terms of service. Under Facebook's terms of service, this kind of influence operation is called 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour', which according to Facebook, is when 'people...coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing..'. However, ordinarily, Facebook's response to these operations is merely to take down the posts constituting these operations and not investigate further or enquire into details such as whether they are foreign or domestic.\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum. Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility. It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof. This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.",

    "## Why the Intervention Prohibition?": "But why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'. The OEWG has also\n111 Nathaniel Gleicher, ‘Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior’ (Facebook, 8 July 2020) <https: 07=\"\" 2020=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" removing-political-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 21 August 2020.\n112 ibid.\n113 Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, Russia (HC 2020, 632) para 47.\n114 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 63.\n115 Damien McGuinness, ‘How a cyber attack transformed Estonia’ (BBC News, 27 April 2017) <https: 39655415=\"\" news=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 31 July 2020.\n116 UNGA ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para 27.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace.¹¹⁷ If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.¹¹⁸\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’.¹¹⁹ In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State.¹²⁰ Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.¹²¹\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’.¹²² This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition.¹²³ They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n¹¹⁷ Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n¹¹⁸ Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 9) .\n¹²⁰ ibid.\n¹²¹ ibid.\n¹²² Wright (n 79).\n¹²³ Gary P.

They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’.¹²⁶ They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’.¹²⁷ As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’.¹²⁸ France¹²⁹ and Iran,¹³⁰ too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage.¹³¹ But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n¹²⁴ ibid 208.\n¹²⁵ ibid 208-209.\n¹²⁶ ibid.\n¹²⁷ ibid.\n¹²⁸ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n¹²⁹ Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n¹³⁰ General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n¹³¹ For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities.¹³² The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.¹³³\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’.¹³⁴ State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people.¹³⁵ It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.¹³⁶ This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.¹³⁷ State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information.

Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially,¹³⁹ they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.",
    "## PART IV": "",
    "## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States": "The effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n¹³⁸ ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹³⁹ Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’.¹⁴⁰ The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.¹⁴¹\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus.¹⁴² He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia.¹⁴³ Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n¹⁴⁰ James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴¹ Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴² Corn (n 4).\n¹⁴³ ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n144 Andrew Hayward, ‘How Elon Musk’s Tweets Move the Cryptocurrency Market’ (The Motley Fool, 17 June 2021) <https: 06=\"\" 17=\"\" 2021=\"\" how-elon-musk-s-tweets-move-the-cryptocurrency-mark=\"\" www.fool.com=\"\" investing=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n145 Sneha Saha, ‘Twitter hack: What happened and how Twitter tackled the Bitcoin scam’ (The Indian Express, 18 July 2020) <https: article=\"\" indianexpress.com=\"\" technology=\"\" social=\"\" tether-hacked-what-happened-bitcoin-scam-6508118=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.¹⁴⁶\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook¹⁴⁷ and Twitter¹⁴⁸ have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge.¹⁴⁹ There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default.¹⁵⁰ The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates.¹⁵¹ Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.¹⁵²\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population\n¹⁴⁶ Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁷ ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\" help=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁸ ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁹ ibid.\n¹⁵⁰ Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\" twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\" www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵¹ Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\" twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\" www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵² ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\" gpa=\"\" facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n137\non State-media, both online and offline, means that a successful impersonation or hijacking of their State-media with a view to spread disinformation on an issue such as Covid-19 and vaccination could have catastrophic effects, majorly hindering governmental efforts to handle the Covid crisis and ensure citizens' welfare. Note that the emphasis on trusted sources online including government sources is especially heightened now given the spate of general mis- and dis-information prevailing about the novel coronavirus.\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.",
    "# CONCLUSION": "Tolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem."

Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.

As Colonel Gary Corn, a former Deputy Legal Counsel to the Joint Chief of Staffs of the United States, aptly put it, it is not that information is being weaponized since that has always been the case, but that novel technologies have amplified the impact of this weaponization to a scale that has become difficult to ignore. The Russian electoral interference operations in the United States in 2016 have thrust the issue of the legality of these operations in international law into focus. More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention. A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State. Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm. Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nthe doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out. Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter. Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State. The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States, chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration'). Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely. These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law, making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas. On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninternational law, critiques of the non-intervention rule point to the shrinking sphere of a State's domaine réservé because 'there are hardly any subject-matters or policy areas today that are inherently removed from the international sphere'.[19] A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question.[20] But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé.[21] This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones.[22] 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'.[23] The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention.[24] The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.[25]\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncompromising details including the fact that the DNC favoured Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate, among others. This effectively divided the Democrats, with Sanders' supporters organizing protests against the DNC and ultimately led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC. Additionally, Russian trolls also functioned as agents of polarization by infiltrating left-wing and right-wing groups and posting divisive and controversial content to manipulate public opinion. In December 2016, as President Barack Obama’s term was coming to a close, the White House released a statement that squarely identified Russia as having conducted cyber operations against the US elections. The statement referred to ‘data theft’ and ‘disclosure activities’ by the Russian government that were clear references to the Russian hack and leaking. The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’. Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum, and to some extent in France as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention. ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n## PART II\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A. The Coercion Criterion\nAlthough the drafters of the UN Charter made it clear that outlawing armed force as an instrument of international policy was foremost in their minds,49 proponents of expansive\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterpretation of the intervention norm can point to the acknowledgement by the ICJ in Nicaragua that there could be both direct and indirect forms of intervention as proof that its meaning can evolve. After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule. However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’. In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force. However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nimperative.56 As Oppenheim stated, the intervening State needs to ‘deprive the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’.57 This requirement is still not met through these kinds of disinformation operations. Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference operations. In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nSimilar was the case with Iran's denial that Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon that was found in Iran's nuclear power plant at its Natanz facility, had anything to do with damage to its centrifuges causing a major setback to its nuclear programme.72 Admitting the consequences of, or even the occurrence of a cyber operation could be an admission of weakness, both domestically and internationally.\nEven when States do speak out, their statements often do not lend much clarity to the understanding of international law in cyberspace. For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ntheir views on how international law should apply to cyberspace.77 The mandate of the Open-Ended Working Group requires its member States to submit ‘national contributions’ in an effort to promote a common understanding on these issues.78 Independently, States are also slowly articulating and releasing their views on international law and cyberspace. The United Kingdom,79 the Netherlands,80 France,81 Germany,82 Australia,83 Iran,84 Finland,85 Estonia,86 New Zealand87 and Israel88 are a few examples of States that have released these\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nexplanatory statements so far.\nWhile these official statements are most certainly a positive development which shed some light on States' views on the subject, even their contribution cannot be exaggerated at least as far as the intervention rule is concerned. Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’. The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention. France’s statement, while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s, which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’. This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule. A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’. The document also refers to and supports the\n Wright (n 79).\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n Government of Australia (n 83).\n Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*. Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants. The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level, if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State. If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n ibid.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110]\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace. If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’. In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State. Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’. This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition. They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Wright (n 79).\n Gary P.

Their main argument for this view is that sovereignty is treated differently in different domains and is not applied as a one-size-fits-all rule. They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’. They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’. As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’. France and Iran, too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage. But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n ibid 208.\n ibid 208-209.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities. The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’. State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people. It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’. This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information.

However, it is still heavily contested whether this right is owed to the public by the government of another State. Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially, they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’. The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus. He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia. Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Corn (n 4).\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook and Twitter have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge. There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default. The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates. Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population\n Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\" help=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ibid.\n Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\" twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\" www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\" twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\" www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\" gpa=\"\" facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem.",

Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology. After all, States have been attempting to shift, influence and control narratives in other States for ages now.

As Colonel Gary Corn, a former Deputy Legal Counsel to the Joint Chief of Staffs of the United States, aptly put it, it is not that information is being weaponized since that has always been the case, but that novel technologies have amplified the impact of this weaponization to a scale that has become difficult to ignore. The Russian electoral interference operations in the United States in 2016 have thrust the issue of the legality of these operations in international law into focus. More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention. A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State. Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm. Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nthe doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out. Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter. Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State. The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States, chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration'). Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely. These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law, making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas. On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninternational law, critiques of the non-intervention rule point to the shrinking sphere of a State's domaine réservé because 'there are hardly any subject-matters or policy areas today that are inherently removed from the international sphere'.[19] A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question.[20] But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé.[21] This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones.[22] 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'.[23] The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention.[24] The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.[25]\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncompromising details including the fact that the DNC favoured Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate, among others. This effectively divided the Democrats, with Sanders' supporters organizing protests against the DNC and ultimately led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC. Additionally, Russian trolls also functioned as agents of polarization by infiltrating left-wing and right-wing groups and posting divisive and controversial content to manipulate public opinion. In December 2016, as President Barack Obama’s term was coming to a close, the White House released a statement that squarely identified Russia as having conducted cyber operations against the US elections. The statement referred to ‘data theft’ and ‘disclosure activities’ by the Russian government that were clear references to the Russian hack and leaking. The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’. Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum, and to some extent in France as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention. ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n## PART II\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A. The Coercion Criterion\nAlthough the drafters of the UN Charter made it clear that outlawing armed force as an instrument of international policy was foremost in their minds,49 proponents of expansive\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterpretation of the intervention norm can point to the acknowledgement by the ICJ in Nicaragua that there could be both direct and indirect forms of intervention as proof that its meaning can evolve. After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule. However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’. In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force. However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nimperative.56 As Oppenheim stated, the intervening State needs to ‘deprive the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’.57 This requirement is still not met through these kinds of disinformation operations. Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference operations. In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nSimilar was the case with Iran's denial that Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon that was found in Iran's nuclear power plant at its Natanz facility, had anything to do with damage to its centrifuges causing a major setback to its nuclear programme.72 Admitting the consequences of, or even the occurrence of a cyber operation could be an admission of weakness, both domestically and internationally.\nEven when States do speak out, their statements often do not lend much clarity to the understanding of international law in cyberspace. For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ntheir views on how international law should apply to cyberspace.77 The mandate of the Open-Ended Working Group requires its member States to submit ‘national contributions’ in an effort to promote a common understanding on these issues.78 Independently, States are also slowly articulating and releasing their views on international law and cyberspace. The United Kingdom,79 the Netherlands,80 France,81 Germany,82 Australia,83 Iran,84 Finland,85 Estonia,86 New Zealand87 and Israel88 are a few examples of States that have released these\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nexplanatory statements so far.\nWhile these official statements are most certainly a positive development which shed some light on States' views on the subject, even their contribution cannot be exaggerated at least as far as the intervention rule is concerned. Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’. The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention. France’s statement, while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s, which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’. This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule. A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’. The document also refers to and supports the\n Wright (n 79).\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n Government of Australia (n 83).\n Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*. Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants. The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level, if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State. If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n ibid.\n Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110]\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace. If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’. In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State. Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’. This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition. They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Wright (n 79).\n Gary P.

Their main argument for this view is that sovereignty is treated differently in different domains and is not applied as a one-size-fits-all rule. They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’. They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’. As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’. France and Iran, too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage. But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n ibid 208.\n ibid 208-209.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities. The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’. State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people. It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’. This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

However, it is still heavily contested whether this right is owed to the public by the government of another State. Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially, they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’. The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus. He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia. Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n Corn (n 4).\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook and Twitter have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge. There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default. The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates. Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries.

This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem."

Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.¹ After all, States have been attempting to shift, influence and control narratives in other States for ages now.

More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention.⁴ A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State.⁵ Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm.⁶ Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n2 Samantha Bradshaw and Philip N Howard, ‘The Global Disinformation Order - 2019 Global Inventory of Organised Social Media Manipulation’ (2019) Oxford Internet Institute Working Paper 2019.2: Project on Computational Propaganda <https: 09=\"\" 19=\"\" 2019=\"\" cjbertroop-report19.pdf=\"\" demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n3 Colonel (Retired) Gary Corn, ‘Punching on the Edges of the Grey Zone: Iranian Cyber Threats and State Cyber Responses’ (Just Security, 11 February 2020) <https: 68622=\"\" punching-on-the-edges-of-the-grey-zone-iranian-cyber-threats-and-state-cyber-responses=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 12 July 2020.\n4 Gary Corn, ‘Coronavirus Disinformation and the Need for States to Shore Up International Law’ (Lawfare, 2 April 2020) <https: coronavirus-disinformation-and-need-states-shore-international-law=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n5 See generally, Harriet Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks: Sovereignty and Non-intervention’ (2019) Chatham House Research Paper <https: 2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" research=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2020.\n6 See generally, Ido Kilovaty, ‘Doxfare: Politically Motivated Leaks and the Future of the Norm</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nthe doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n7 Michael N Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, 47.\n8 Office of the Press Secretary, ‘Statement by the President on Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (The White House, 29 December 2016) <https: 3xxd-8k5c=\"\" perma.cc=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020 (Office of the Press Secretary).\n9 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua. v U.S.) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 14 .</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out.¹⁰ Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter.¹¹ Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State.¹² The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States,¹³ chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration').¹⁴ Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.¹⁵\nNow turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely.¹⁶ These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law,¹⁷ making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n10 ibid.\n11 Sean Watts, 'Low-Intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-Intervention' (2015) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 137.\n12 M.N.S.

A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question. But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé. This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones. 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'. The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention. The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n19 Katja S Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé', in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (OUP 2013).\n20 Moynihan (n 5) 34.\n21 Ziegler (n 19).\n22 Kunig (n 17) 3.\n23 Nicaragua (n 9) .\n24 Moynihan (n 5) 28.\n25 See for instance, Friendly Relations Declaration (n 14), princ. 3 - 'No State may...coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind.'; see also, Michael N.

The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention.³⁴ ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n26 Tom Hamburger and Karen Tumulty, ‘WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations’ (The Washington Post, 23 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 22=\"\" news=\"\" post-politics=\"\" opi=\"\" opi2016=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" wpr=\"\"></https:> accessed 14 July 2021.\n27 Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin, ‘Democrats Struggle for Unity on First Day of Convention’ (The New York Times, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 26=\"\" us=\"\" points=\"\" politics=\"\" dnc-speakers-protests-sanders.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n28 Dan Roberts, Ben Jacobs and Alan Yuhas, ‘Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Resign as DNC Chair as Email Scandal Rocks Democrats’ (The Guardian, 25 July 2016) <https: 2016=\"\" 24=\"\" debate-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders=\"\" us-news=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n29 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs, ‘Disinformation and Propaganda – Impact on the Functioning of the Rule of Law in the EU and Its Member States’ (2019) Study conducted by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) PE 608.864, 39 <https: 2019=\"\" 608864=\"\" eudata=\"\" eudg=\"\" etudes=\"\" gta=\"\" IPOL_STU(2019)608864_en.pdf=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n30 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n31 ibid.\n32 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs (n 28) 41; See also, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report (HC 2018, 363) para 2.\n33 Gabriel Gatehouse, ‘Marine Le Pen: Who’s funding France’s far right?’ (BBC News, 3 April 2017) <https: news=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n34 See generally, Kilovaty (n 6).</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n35 ibid 152.\n36 ibid 172.\n37 See generally, Schmitt 'Virtual' Disenfranchisement (n 7).\n38 ibid 51.\n39 ibid.\n40 ibid.\n41 Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), Oppenheim's International Law (vol 1, 9th edn, OUP 2008) 432.\n42 Moynihan (n 5) 29.\n43 Nicaragua (n 9) .\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n## PART II\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A.

After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule.⁵¹ However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’.⁵² In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.⁵³\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force.⁵⁴ However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.⁵⁵\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n50 Nicaragua (n 9) .\n51 ibid .\n52 ibid .\n53 Brownlie (n 49) 361–368 - ‘There can be little doubt that ‘use of force’ is commonly understood to imply a military attack, an ‘armed attack’, by the organized military, naval, or air forces of a state’; Oona A.

Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n56 Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Peacetime Cyber Espionage – New Tendencies in Public International Law’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), *Peacetime Regime For State Activities In Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations And Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE Publications 2013) 425, 433 - ‘Scholars assert that illegal coercion implies massive influence, inducing the affected state to adopt a decision with regard to its policy or practice which it would not entertain as a free and sovereign state’.\n57 Jennings and Watts (n 41).\n58 Alexander Lanoszka, ‘Disinformation in International Politics’ (2019) 4 European Journal of International Security 227, 233.\n59 ibid.\n60 Lanoszka (n 58).\n61 See Michael N.

In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n62 Jack Stubbs, ‘Hackers hit UK political parties with back-to-back cyberattacks’ (Reuters, 12 November 2019) <https: article=\"\" us-britain-election-labour-cyber-iduskbn1xm19l=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n63 ibid.\n64 ibid.\n65 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 52.\n66 Stubbs (n 62).</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n67 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 51.\n68 ibid.\n69 UNCHR ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression’ (2015) UN Doc A/HRC/29/32 para 16.\n70 Statute of the International Court of Justice (entered into force 18 April 1946) art 38.\n71 Aditi Agrawal and Nikhil Pahwa, ‘Lt Gen.

For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n72 William Yong, 'Iran Denies Malware Connection to Nuclear Delay' (The New York Times, 5 October 2010) <https: 06=\"\" 10=\"\" 2010=\"\" middleeast=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\" world=\"\"> accessed 30 July 2020.\n73 Staff Reporter, 'The Interview: North Korea responsible for 'destructive' Sony hack says FBI' (ABC News, 20 December 2014) <https: 2014-12-20=\"\" news=\"\" north-korea-behind-sony-hack-says-united-states=\"\" 5980794=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.\n74 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n75 See generally, Michael N.

Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’.⁸⁹ The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention.⁹⁰ France’s statement,⁹¹ while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s,⁹² which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’.⁹³ This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule.⁹⁴ A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’.⁹⁵ The document also refers to and supports the\n⁸⁹ Wright (n 79).\n⁹⁰ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n⁹¹ Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n⁹² Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n⁹³ Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n⁹⁴ Government of Australia (n 83).\n⁹⁵ Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n96 ibid 10.\n97 Schöndorf (n 88).\n98 General Staff of Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n99 ibid.\n100 Government of New Zealand (n 87).\n101 ibid.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*.¹⁰² Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants.¹⁰³ The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.¹⁰⁴\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level,¹⁰⁵ if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State.¹⁰⁶ If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n¹⁰² International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n¹⁰³ Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n¹⁰⁴ ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 3 , .\n¹⁰⁶ Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'. Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4). Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably, and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n107 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 43, 169.\n108 Nicaragua (n 9) , , , .\n109 ibid .\n110 See generally, Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285-299.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n129\nwill be vital. Interestingly, apart from disinformation that is especially harmful such as those related to coronavirus and so on, a social media influence campaign (whether State-sponsored or not) can very often violate the platform's own rules or terms of service. Under Facebook's terms of service, this kind of influence operation is called 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour', which according to Facebook, is when 'people...coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing..'. However, ordinarily, Facebook's response to these operations is merely to take down the posts constituting these operations and not investigate further or enquire into details such as whether they are foreign or domestic.\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum. Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility. It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof. This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'. The OEWG has also\n111 Nathaniel Gleicher, ‘Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior’ (Facebook, 8 July 2020) <https: 07=\"\" 2020=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" removing-political-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 21 August 2020.\n112 ibid.\n113 Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, Russia (HC 2020, 632) para 47.\n114 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 63.\n115 Damien McGuinness, ‘How a cyber attack transformed Estonia’ (BBC News, 27 April 2017) <https: 39655415=\"\" news=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 31 July 2020.\n116 UNGA ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para 27.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace.¹¹⁷ If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.¹¹⁸\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’.¹¹⁹ In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State.¹²⁰ Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.¹²¹\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’.¹²² This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition.¹²³ They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n¹¹⁷ Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n¹¹⁸ Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 9) .\n¹²⁰ ibid.\n¹²¹ ibid.\n¹²² Wright (n 79).\n¹²³ Gary P. Corn and Robert Taylor, ‘Sovereignty in the Age of Cyber’ (2017) 111 AJIL Unbound 207.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\nconsent,¹²⁴ and does not bar cyber operations that affect cyber-infrastructure within another State, unless the cyber operations rise to the level of a prohibited intervention or use of force.¹²⁵ Their main argument for this view is that sovereignty is treated differently in different domains and is not applied as a one-size-fits-all rule. They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’.¹²⁶ They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’.¹²⁷ As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’.¹²⁸ France¹²⁹ and Iran,¹³⁰ too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage.¹³¹ But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may\n¹²⁴ ibid 208.\n¹²⁵ ibid 208-209.\n¹²⁶ ibid.\n¹²⁷ ibid.\n¹²⁸ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n¹²⁹ Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\" 2019=\"\" 24=\"\" paniojuris.org=\"\" 24=\"\" finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n¹³⁰ General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n¹³¹ For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nvery well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities.¹³² The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.¹³³\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’.¹³⁴ State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people.¹³⁵ It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.¹³⁶ This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.¹³⁷ State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information.

Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially,¹³⁹ they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n¹³⁸ ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹³⁹ Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nthe know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’.¹⁴⁰ The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.¹⁴¹\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus.¹⁴² He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia.¹⁴³ Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n¹⁴⁰ James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴¹ Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴² Corn (n 4).\n¹⁴³ ibid.</https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n144 Andrew Hayward, ‘How Elon Musk’s Tweets Move the Cryptocurrency Market’ (The Motley Fool, 17 June 2021) <https: 06=\"\" 17=\"\" 2021=\"\" how-elon-musk-s-tweets-move-the-cryptocurrency-mark=\"\" www.fool.com=\"\" investing=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n145 Sneha Saha, ‘Twitter hack: What happened and how Twitter tackled the Bitcoin scam’ (The Indian Express, 18 July 2020) <https: article=\"\" indianexpress.com=\"\" technology=\"\" social=\"\" tether-hacked-what-happened-bitcoin-scam-6508118=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\ncentrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.¹⁴⁶\nSocial media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook¹⁴⁷ and Twitter¹⁴⁸ have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge.¹⁴⁹ There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default.¹⁵⁰ The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates.¹⁵¹ Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.¹⁵²\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population\n¹⁴⁶ Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁷ ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\" help=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁸ ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\" help.twitter.com=\"\" managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁹ ibid.\n¹⁵⁰ Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\" twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\" www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵¹ Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\" twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\" www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵² ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\" gpa=\"\" facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n137\non State-media, both online and offline, means that a successful impersonation or hijacking of their State-media with a view to spread disinformation on an issue such as Covid-19 and vaccination could have catastrophic effects, majorly hindering governmental efforts to handle the Covid crisis and ensure citizens' welfare. Note that the emphasis on trusted sources online including government sources is especially heightened now given the spate of general mis- and dis-information prevailing about the novel coronavirus.\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem."

Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality That the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.¹ After all, States have been attempting to shift, influence and control narratives in other States for ages now. What has changed?\nThe advent of the digital age and the increasingly accessible means to disseminate information simultaneously to an audience of millions of people have considerably changed the rules of the game. States are now leveraging computational propaganda, * Advocate, India.

More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention.⁴ A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State.⁵ Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm.⁶ Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention the doxfare as well as the use of ‘troll farm(s)’ by Russia’s Internet Research Agency to create fake identities online to spread incorrect information and feigning the source thereof to confound voters as arguably constituting ‘unlawful interference’.7 States, on the other hand, have either been silent or, when breaking their silence, have used terms such as ‘violations of established international norms’8 which broadly convey that such actions are unacceptable, rather than highlight any particular rule of international law that the action has violated in their view.\nPart I of this article lays out the content of the intervention prohibition and identifies a growing chorus to invoke the international law prohibition on intervention to regulate these operations. Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n## PART I ### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention The non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in on Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III the UN Charter despite not being expressly spelled out.¹⁰ Commentators have often drawn its source from Article 2(1) and 2(4) of the Charter.¹¹ Further, some scholars also specifically point to Article 2(7) of the Charter as evidence of its presence in the Charter, although this provision prohibits intervention by the United Nations (as opposed to its member States) into matters which are part of the domestic jurisdiction of any State.¹² The principle is also acknowledged and reflected in numerous declarations and instruments adopted by States,¹³ chief among them being the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN ('Friendly Relations Declaration').¹⁴ Prior to this, the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty also stated that 'no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State'.¹⁵ Now turning to the content of the principle, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case stated that a prohibited intervention must be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of sovereignty, to decide freely.¹⁶ These 'matters' have come to be understood as falling within a State's 'domaine réservé', constituting those areas that are the sole purview of States unregulated by international law,¹⁷ making it the first requirement for a State-action to amount to an intervention. The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention international law, critiques of the non-intervention rule point to the shrinking sphere of a State's domaine réservé because 'there are hardly any subject-matters or policy areas today that are inherently removed from the international sphere'.[19] A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question.[20] But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé.[21] This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones.[22] 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'.[23] The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention.[24] The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.[25] B. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition Digital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III compromising details including the fact that the DNC favoured Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate, among others.²⁶ This effectively divided the Democrats, with Sanders' supporters organizing protests against the DNC²⁷ and ultimately led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC.²⁸ Additionally, Russian trolls also functioned as agents of polarization by infiltrating left-wing and right-wing groups and posting divisive and controversial content to manipulate public opinion.²⁹ In December 2016, as President Barack Obama’s term was coming to a close, the White House released a statement that squarely identified Russia as having conducted cyber operations against the US elections.³⁰ The statement referred to ‘data theft’ and ‘disclosure activities’ by the Russian government that were clear references to the Russian hack and leaking. The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention.³⁴ ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention into foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36 Another view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40 Both these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition, NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III it calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47 ## PART II Clearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n## A. The Coercion Criterion Although the drafters of the UN Charter made it clear that outlawing armed force as an instrument of international policy was foremost in their minds,49 proponents of expansive Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention interpretation of the intervention norm can point to the acknowledgement by the ICJ in Nicaragua that there could be both direct and indirect forms of intervention⁵⁰ as proof that its meaning can evolve. After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule.⁵¹ However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’.⁵² In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.⁵³ The Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force.⁵⁴ However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.⁵⁵ Even so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III imperative.56 As Oppenheim stated, the intervening State needs to ‘deprive the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’.57 This requirement is still not met through these kinds of disinformation operations. Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58 Additionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention interference operations. In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63 Let us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66 Much more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III to Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68 While the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views Customary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71 Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention Similar was the case with Iran's denial that Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon that was found in Iran's nuclear power plant at its Natanz facility, had anything to do with damage to its centrifuges causing a major setback to its nuclear programme.72 Admitting the consequences of, or even the occurrence of a cyber operation could be an admission of weakness, both domestically and internationally.\nEven when States do speak out, their statements often do not lend much clarity to the understanding of international law in cyberspace. For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate article29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III their views on how international law should apply to cyberspace.77 The mandate of the Open-Ended Working Group requires its member States to submit ‘national contributions’ in an effort to promote a common understanding on these issues.78 Independently, States are also slowly articulating and releasing their views on international law and cyberspace. The United Kingdom,79 the Netherlands,80 France,81 Germany,82 Australia,83 Iran,84 Finland,85 Estonia,86 New Zealand87 and Israel88 are a few examples of States that have released these Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention explanatory statements so far.\nWhile these official statements are most certainly a positive development which shed some light on States' views on the subject, even their contribution cannot be exaggerated at least as far as the intervention rule is concerned. Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’.⁸⁹ The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention.⁹⁰ France’s statement,⁹¹ while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s,⁹² which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’.⁹³ This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule.⁹⁴ A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’.⁹⁵ The document also refers to and supports the ⁸⁹ Wright (n 79).\n⁹⁰ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n⁹¹ Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n⁹² Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n⁹³ Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n⁹⁴ Government of Australia (n 83).\n⁹⁵ Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:> NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III UK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97 Iran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention In any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution Even if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*.¹⁰² Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants.¹⁰³ The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.¹⁰⁴ Assuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level,¹⁰⁵ if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State.¹⁰⁶ If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n¹⁰² International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n¹⁰³ Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\"2016=\"\"25=\"\"articles=\"\"the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\"index.html=\"\"www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n¹⁰⁴ ibid.\n¹⁰⁵ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n¹⁰⁶ Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:> NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III The question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110] Additionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n## PART III ## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III noted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace.¹¹⁷ If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.¹¹⁸ Later in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc.,... not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’.¹¹⁹ In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State.¹²⁰ Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.¹²¹ However, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’.¹²² This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition.¹²³ They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without ¹¹⁷ Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n¹¹⁸ Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n¹²⁰ ibid.\n¹²¹ ibid.\n¹²² Wright (n 79).\n¹²³ Gary P. Corn and Robert Taylor, ‘Sovereignty in the Age of Cyber’ (2017) 111 AJIL Unbound 207.\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention consent,¹²⁴ and does not bar cyber operations that affect cyber-infrastructure within another State, unless the cyber operations rise to the level of a prohibited intervention or use of force.¹²⁵ Their main argument for this view is that sovereignty is treated differently in different domains and is not applied as a one-size-fits-all rule. They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’.¹²⁶ They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’.¹²⁷ As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’.¹²⁸ France¹²⁹ and Iran,¹³⁰ too, have echoed this view.\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage.¹³¹ But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal. For context, incidents such as the malware discovered in one of India’s nuclear power plants, even if State-sponsored, may ¹²⁴ ibid 208.\n¹²⁵ ibid 208-209.\n¹²⁶ ibid.\n¹²⁷ ibid.\n¹²⁸ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80) 2.\n¹²⁹ Przemysław Roguski, ‘France’s Declaration on International Law in Cyberspace: The Law of Peacetime Cyber Operations, Part I’ (Opinio Juris, 24 September 2019) <http: 09=\"\"2019=\"\"24=\"\"paniojuris.org=\"\"24=\"\"finances-declaration-on-international-law-in-cyberspace-the-law-of-peacetime-cyber-operations-part-i=\"\"></http:> accessed 12 August 2020.\n¹³⁰ General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n¹³¹ For a discussion, see generally, Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (1st edn, Hart Publishing 2018).\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III very well not fall in the net of international law. The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities.¹³² The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.¹³³ Besides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’.¹³⁴ State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people.¹³⁵ It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.¹³⁶ This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.¹³⁷ State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information.

Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially,¹³⁹ they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n## PART IV ## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States The effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in ¹³⁸ ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\"resources=\"\"www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹³⁹ Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\"human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\"www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:> NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III the know so to speak, voters would reasonably believe this false information which would then influence how they vote in the elections. Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’.¹⁴⁰ The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.¹⁴¹ Based on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus.¹⁴² He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia.¹⁴³ Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause ¹⁴⁰ James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\"18=\"\"2020=\"\"europe=\"\"eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\"index.html=\"\"www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴¹ Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\"2020=\"\"28=\"\"coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\"index.html=\"\"politics=\"\"www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n¹⁴² Corn (n 4).\n¹⁴³ ibid.</https:></https:> Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention interference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III centrality in the spread of information on social media than bots with respect to politically contentious issues.¹⁴⁶ Social media platforms are already cognizant of the magnitude of influence of these accounts, as measures taken to prevent their misuse indicate. Both Facebook¹⁴⁷ and Twitter¹⁴⁸ have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge.¹⁴⁹ There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default.¹⁵⁰ The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates.¹⁵¹ Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.¹⁵² The importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online. Other State actors hijacking these accounts on social media can potentially more easily subvert the internal affairs of these countries. For instance, the high reliance of the Chinese population ¹⁴⁶ Sandra González-Bailón and Manlio De Domenico, ‘Bots Are Less Central than Verified Accounts during Contentious Political Events’ (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <https: abstract=\"3637121\"papers.ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁷ ‘How do I request a verified badge on Facebook?’ (Facebook Help Centre) <https: 1288173394636262=\"\"help=\"\"help.twitter.com=\"\"www.facebook.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁸ ‘About Verified Accounts’ (Twitter Help Center) <https: about-twitter-verified-accounts=\"\"help.twitter.com=\"\"managing-your-account=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁴⁹ ibid.\n¹⁵⁰ Andrew Hutchinson, ‘Twitter Implements New Security Measures to Protect the Accounts of US Election Candidates’ (Social Media Today, 17 September 2020) <https: news=\"\"twitter-implents-new-security-measures-to-protect-the-accounts-of-us-elec=\"\"www.socialmediatoday.com=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵¹ Stephanie Condon, ‘Twitter imposes new security rules for US political accounts ahead of the 2020 election’ (ZDNet, 17 September 2020) <https: article=\"\"twitter-plans-to-protect-high-profile-us-political-accounts-ahead-of-the-2020-election=\"\"www.zdnet.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n¹⁵² ‘Facebook Protect’ (Facebook for Government, Politics and Advocacy) <https: en-gb.facebook-protect=\"\"gpa=\"\"facebook=\"\"> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:></https:></https:> Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention Limiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n# CONCLUSION Tolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as NLUD Journal of Legal Studies Vol. III authentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem."

The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n10 ibid.\n11 Sean Watts, 'Low-Intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-Intervention' (2015) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 137.\n12 M.N.S.

A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question. But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé. This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones. 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'. The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention. The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act. An example is the hack-and-dump operation carried out on the Democratic National Congress, allegedly by Russia, significantly influencing the hugely important US presidential elections. Several thousands of emails pertaining to the DNC were leaked through Wikileaks, which contained\n19 Katja S Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé', in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (OUP 2013).\n20 Moynihan (n 5) 34.\n21 Ziegler (n 19).\n22 Kunig (n 17) 3.\n23 Nicaragua (n 9) .\n24 Moynihan (n 5) 28.\n25 See for instance, Friendly Relations Declaration (n 14), princ. 3 - 'No State may...coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind.'; see also, Michael N.

The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to. One view is that the hack-and-dump operations or ‘doxfare’, amount to intervention.³⁴ ‘Doxfare’ is defined as ‘state-sponsored instructions\n26 Tom Hamburger and Karen Tumulty, ‘WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations’ (The Washington Post, 23 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 22=\"\" news=\"\" post-politics=\"\" opi=\"\" opi2016=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" wpr=\"\"></https:> accessed 14 July 2021.\n27 Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin, ‘Democrats Struggle for Unity on First Day of Convention’ (The New York Times, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 26=\"\" us=\"\" points=\"\" politics=\"\" dnc-speakers-protests-sanders.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n28 Dan Roberts, Ben Jacobs and Alan Yuhas, ‘Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Resign as DNC Chair as Email Scandal Rocks Democrats’ (The Guardian, 25 July 2016) <https: 2016=\"\" 24=\"\" debate-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders=\"\" us-news=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n29 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs, ‘Disinformation and Propaganda – Impact on the Functioning of the Rule of Law in the EU and Its Member States’ (2019) Study conducted by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) PE 608.864, 39 <https: 2019=\"\" 608864=\"\" eudata=\"\" eudg=\"\" etudes=\"\" gta=\"\" IPOL_STU(2019)608864_en.pdf=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\" www.europarl.europa.eu=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n30 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n31 ibid.\n32 Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs (n 28) 41; See also, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report (HC 2018, 363) para 2.\n33 Gabriel Gatehouse, ‘Marine Le Pen: Who’s funding France’s far right?’ (BBC News, 3 April 2017) <https: news=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" world-europe-39478066=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n34 See generally, Kilovaty (n 6).</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nReflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\ninto foreign computer systems and networks to collect bulk, non-public data that are then leaked for public consumption'.35 The Russian hack-and-dump operation on the DNC is an example of doxfare that is prohibited intervention. Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n35 ibid 152.\n36 ibid 172.\n37 See generally, Schmitt 'Virtual' Disenfranchisement (n 7).\n38 ibid 51.\n39 ibid.\n40 ibid.\n41 Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), Oppenheim's International Law (vol 1, 9th edn, OUP 2008) 432.\n42 Moynihan (n 5) 29.\n43 Nicaragua (n 9) .\nNLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n\n---\n\n## # CONCLUSION\n\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community.

    "# REFLECTIONS ON INFORMATION INFLUENCE OPERATIONS AS ILLEGAL INTERVENTION\n\nSharngan Aravindakshan*\n\nThe dust is yet to settle on the issue of the applicability of the United Nations Charter to cyberspace, but international law is already facing its most vexing issue yet in cyberspace – foreign information influence operations. Thrust into focus by the Russian interference into the US elections in 2016, this issue has sparked a furious debate in the international community, with several legal scholars recommending the prohibition on intervention in the internal affairs of States as a tool to regulate this new phenomenon. However, the intervention prohibition is not so easily applied to foreign information influence operations. This article identifies three hurdles to this argument – the coercion criterion, a lack of clarity in States' views and difficulties in attribution. The article also highlights the flaws in current scholarly approaches to the issue and proposes a modified, more suitable version of the deception test for acceptance by States.\n\nKeywords: disinformation, intervention prohibition, digital age, coercion, illegality\n\nThat the ‘fake news’ phenomenon has been perplexing governments for a while now can almost single-handedly be attributed to advances in technology.¹ After all, States have been attempting to shift, influence and control narratives in other States for ages now. What has changed?\n\nThe advent of the digital age and the increasingly accessible means to disseminate information simultaneously to an audience of millions of people have considerably changed the rules of the game. States are now leveraging computational propaganda,\n\n* Advocate, India.

More recently, allegedly State-sponsored online disinformation operations aimed at sowing panic and hampering States' efforts to adequately deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, have also lent urgency to understanding how to regulate these actions in international law.\n\nThere is growing scholarly opinion that such operations should be considered as amounting to intervention in the internal affairs of States, prohibited under both customary international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 1945 ('UN Charter or Charter'). In the context of the ongoing battle against Covid-19, at least one scholar has opined that the information operations by Russia are 'covert information campaigns aimed at intervening in and overcoming the free will of the targeted state' by 'disrupting public health efforts', thereby constituting an internationally wrongful act in the form of prohibited intervention.⁴ A report by Chatham House also concurs to the extent it argues that the requirement of 'coercion' in prohibited intervention should be interpreted to include disinformation operations by States that have significant consequences in the internal affairs of another State.⁵ Somewhat more cautiously, other scholars have chosen to separately examine constituent or component actions of an overall information influence operation through the lens of the intervention prohibition. One such view, for instance, argues that with regard to the overall Russian information operation pertaining to the United States elections in 2016, the hacking and leaking of confidential information pertaining to the Democratic National Party (again presumed Russian) or 'doxfare', should be considered a violation of the non-intervention norm.⁶ Noted international law scholar Prof. Michael Schmitt identifies both\n\n2 Samantha Bradshaw and Philip N Howard, ‘The Global Disinformation Order - 2019 Global Inventory of Organised Social Media Manipulation’ (2019) Oxford Internet Institute Working Paper 2019.2: Project on Computational Propaganda <https: 09=\"\" 19=\"\" 2019=\"\" cjbertroop-report19.pdf=\"\" demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2021.\n\n3 Colonel (Retired) Gary Corn, ‘Punching on the Edges of the Grey Zone: Iranian Cyber Threats and State Cyber Responses’ (Just Security, 11 February 2020) <https: 68622=\"\" punching-on-the-edges-of-the-grey-zone-iranian-cyber-threats-and-state-cyber-responses=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 12 July 2020.\n\n4 Gary Corn, ‘Coronavirus Disinformation and the Need for States to Shore Up International Law’ (Lawfare, 2 April 2020) <https: coronavirus-disinformation-and-need-states-shore-international-law=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020.\n\n5 See generally, Harriet Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks: Sovereignty and Non-intervention’ (2019) Chatham House Research Paper <https: 2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" research=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\"> accessed 14 July 2020.\n\n6 See generally, Ido Kilovaty, ‘Doxfare: Politically Motivated Leaks and the Future of the Norm</https:></https:></https:>",

Although attractive, this argument is not perfect and Part II identifies the challenges and hurdles this approach faces, both legal and technological, as well as examines existing State appetite for using the intervention norm for this purpose. Part III briefly highlights the importance of the intervention prohibition in cyberspace in view of emerging interpretations of sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that States may not be quick to embrace the intervention norm with regard to such operations.\n\nThe author is cognizant that ‘information influence operation’ is a loose, umbrella term that could be taken to mean several actions by States, including cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage, that they undertake in their continuously ongoing efforts to achieve strategic and tactical advantages. This article, however, will focus on States’ online disinformation operations, especially through social media. Other cyber operations such as doxfare and distributed denial-of-service attacks will be briefly engaged with, as useful examples to illustrate the applicability (or inapplicability) of the intervention prohibition.\n\nThe article will also assume that the DNC hack, as well as Covid-19 disinformation campaigns, are attributable to a State or States under international law.\n\n## PART I\n\n### A. Understanding the Prohibition on Intervention\n\nThe non-intervention principle involves the right of every State to conduct its affairs without outside interference.9 The International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) has acknowledged the principle as a part and parcel of customary international law, and by virtue of being a corollary of the principle of sovereign equality of States, it is also considered as embodied in\n\non Non-Intervention in the Era of Weaponized Information’ (2018) 9 Harvard National Security Journal 146.\n\n7 Michael N Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, 47.\n\n8 Office of the Press Secretary, ‘Statement by the President on Actions in Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (The White House, 29 December 2016) <https: 3xxd-8k5c=\"\" perma.cc=\"\"> accessed 12 July 2020 (Office of the Press Secretary).\n\n9 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua. v U.S.) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 14 [202].</https:>",

The ICJ in Nicaragua helpfully pointed to the 'choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system' as well as the 'formulation of foreign policy' as illustrative of these areas.¹⁸ On a related note, while these areas were traditionally unreservedly within the sole purview of States and untouched by\n\n10 ibid.\n11 Sean Watts, 'Low-Intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-Intervention' (2015) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 137.\n12 M.N.S.

    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\ninternational law, critiques of the non-intervention rule point to the shrinking sphere of a State's domaine réservé because 'there are hardly any subject-matters or policy areas today that are inherently removed from the international sphere'.[19] A recent paper by Chatham House, however, argues that even if international law has some bearing on the policy area in question, it would still fall within the domaine réservé of a State if it retains ultimate authority over the area in question.[20] But in any case, the way a State's political system is structured, the way a government came into power and its provenance (whether military or civilian) are still considered as principally within the domaine réservé.[21] This brings a State's democratic processes such as the conduct of its elections unquestionably within such State's domaine réservé.\n\nIntervention in another State's domaine réservé is wrongful when it uses 'methods of coercion' in regard to choices which must remain free ones.[22] 'Coercion' therefore constitutes the second element to constituting prohibited intervention and, according to the ICJ in Nicaragua, it forms the 'very essence of prohibited intervention' and is 'particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State'.[23] The requirement of coercion is meant to distinguish minor interferences or unfriendly acts from more serious acts that can breach the prohibition on intervention.[24] The term itself is undefined in international law but it is generally agreed that it involves an affirmative act designed to deprive the State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.[25]\n\nB. The Russian Electoral Interference Operation - Calls Begin for Expanding the Intervention Prohibition\n\nDigital capabilities have enhanced States' abilities to engage in subversive operations against other States without resorting to coercive force, thereby seemingly falling outside the scope of intervention as an internationally wrongful act.

The statement also called Russia’s information operation ‘an effort to harm U.S interests in violation of established international norms of behaviour’.³¹ Significantly, the statement did not characterize the kind of violation caused by the Russian hack and leak, whether a prohibited intervention or otherwise, which can only be seen as a mark of the complexity of both the operation as well as the legal rules involved. A significant amount of Russian interference in the form of online disinformation campaigns has also been noted in the Brexit referendum,³² and to some extent in France³³ as well.\n\nScholars have expressed a multitude of views on both the legality of as well as the kind of violation these operations amount to.

Notably, this view discards 'coercion' as a requirement for intervention, while introducing a new, considerably watered down criterion of 'disruption'. The key issue is reframed as 'whether a cyberoperation employing doxfare disrupts the protected internal or external affairs of the victim state'.36\n\nAnother view is that 'election meddling' could certainly meet the coercive requirement of prohibited intervention.37 But in the case of the Russian electoral interference operation, only the Russian trolls that spread disinformation by feigning American citizenship and the Russian doxfare operation on the DNC are likely to constitute prohibited intervention.38 According to this view, the 'deceptive nature of trolling' distinguished it from a mere influence operation to intervention and its covert nature deprived the American electorate of its freedom of choice by creating a situation in which it could not fairly evaluate the information it was provided.39 As for the doxfare, this view regards it as having 'tainted the electoral process by introducing information that...was acquired by means that are expressly prohibited under US domestic law, as well as the law of most other States... which is the unlawful penetration and exfiltration of private data'.40\n\nBoth these views acknowledge and grapple with the difficulties of applying the intervention prohibition to complex operations in cyberspace. Neither makes the broad argument that these operations in general would violate the intervention prohibition.\n\nA recent report by British think-tank Chatham House also makes the case that existing interpretations of the coercion requirement are far too restrictive. It invokes Oppenheim's definition that '...to constitute intervention the interference must be forcible, or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question',41 and relies on the words 'otherwise coercive' to argue that intervention can consist of actions that are not merely forcible.42 It deals with Nicaragua's close and comparable treatment of the prohibition on intervention and use of force by pointing to the ICJ's statement in the decision that the court will only define those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.43 Arguing that Nicaragua should not be considered prescriptive in nature as regards the intervention prohibition,\n\n35 ibid 152.\n36 ibid 172.\n37 See generally, Schmitt 'Virtual' Disenfranchisement (n 7).\n38 ibid 51.\n39 ibid.\n40 ibid.\n41 Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), Oppenheim's International Law (vol 1, 9th edn, OUP 2008) 432.\n42 Moynihan (n 5) 29.\n43 Nicaragua (n 9) [205].",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nit calls for acknowledgement that the prohibition can be invoked for a broader range of actions as opposed to only those that were forcible in nature.44 This report has found support among other scholars such as Col. Gary Corn who rely on it to argue that State action such as Russia's concerted electoral interference operation in the West should fall within the catchment area of prohibited intervention.45 Since they do not refer to any constituent action of the operation, it is assumed they mean the broad range of actions that constitute the Russian electoral interference operation.\n\nYet another view is that electoral interference information operations violate the right to self-determination, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention.46 Also finding it difficult to overcome the high threshold of coercion, both in terms of its nature (forcible or otherwise) as well as in terms of consequences/impact, as far as information operations are concerned, this view turns to the right to self-determination as an essential part of a State's right to freely decide its own political system, and uses that route to reach the intervention violation.47\n\n## PART II\n\nClearly, there is a growing demand (atleast in Western academic circles) for States' information operations in cyberspace aimed at influencing outcomes in other States to be considered as violations of the intervention prohibition. Or at the least, for more clarity on the contours of the rule vis-à-vis such operations. This is understandable, given that errant States (common suspects being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea48) are cleverly ensuring they are operating in so-called 'grey zones' of international law, thereby succeeding in both securing their desired outcomes in other States, as well as restricting those States' choices of response.\n\nHowever, arguing that the norm of intervention already prohibits, or ought to prohibit, information influence operations will not be easy. This part discusses the challenges or hurdles that this argument will have to overcome before gaining acceptance.\n\n## A.

After all, in Nicaragua, the ICJ ruled that the US actions of financing, training, supplying arms as well as providing intelligence and logistic support to the rebel contras in Nicaragua was a violation of the non-intervention rule.⁵¹ However, it cannot be denied that this is still an extremely high threshold, the direct consequence of these actions being a military uprising within Nicaragua to overthrow the existing government. Indeed, in the context of ‘assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’, the ICJ also stated that ‘such assistance may be regarded as a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States’.⁵² In essence, the ICJ effectively considered these coercive acts only a short step from amounting to the use of force itself, which is commonly understood to require measures involving physical force.⁵³\n\nThe Nicaragua decision notwithstanding, the meaning of coercion in international law is still more easily relatable to cases of armed force.⁵⁴ However, the bulk of scholarly opinion today is on the side of the view that coercion for the purposes of the intervention prohibition does not necessarily have to involve physical or armed force.⁵⁵\n\nEven so, ‘coercion’ as an ingredient for prohibited intervention still requires that the victim State be compelled or restrained from a course of action – a do-this-or-else\n\n50 Nicaragua (n 9) [205].\n\n51 ibid [242].\n\n52 ibid [195].\n\n53 Brownlie (n 49) 361–368 - ‘There can be little doubt that ‘use of force’ is commonly understood to imply a military attack, an ‘armed attack’, by the organized military, naval, or air forces of a state’; Oona A.

Leaving aside the Russian doxfare operation for a moment, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the Russian online troll farms caused the United States to be restricted or restrained from deciding freely with respect to matters in its domain reserve. Indeed it is an inherent difficulty in dealing with ‘fake news’ as a phenomenon that its actual impact is extremely difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty.58\n\nAdditionally, it is difficult to establish that even widespread disinformation can influence or impact States’ decision-making.59 In their day-to-day manifestations as governments, States have somewhat more privileged access to authentic sources of information which they base their decisions on, as compared to their general public.60 This makes it even less likely that concerted disinformation campaigns can coerce States.\n\nHowever, the doxfare operation would still qualify as coercion, since it deprived the US of control over confidential state information, inasmuch as it leaked the said information to Wikileaks which in turn released it into the public domain, and is, therefore, a good contender for violating the prohibition on intervention. An interesting counter-argument here would be that the doxfare operation does not amount to intervention since under the right to speech and expression in international human rights law, notwithstanding relevant exceptions, Wikileaks arguably had the right to disseminate the information and the US public could have a right to receive the said information given the public interest it would serve. However, this may not be relevant insofar as the internationally wrongful act of intervention is concerned since the administration of human rights within its territory also arguably falls within a State’s domain reserve.61 This means that it was still up to the United States government to decide whether or not to release the said information, and to the extent the Russian doxfare took it out of the United States’ hands through coercive means, it may constitute prohibited intervention.\n\nThe Russian interference in the US elections is not the only example of electoral\n\n56 Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Peacetime Cyber Espionage – New Tendencies in Public International Law’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), *Peacetime Regime For State Activities In Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations And Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE Publications 2013) 425, 433 - ‘Scholars assert that illegal coercion implies massive influence, inducing the affected state to adopt a decision with regard to its policy or practice which it would not entertain as a free and sovereign state’.\n\n57 Jennings and Watts (n 41).\n\n58 Alexander Lanoszka, ‘Disinformation in International Politics’ (2019) 4 European Journal of International Security 227, 233.\n\n59 ibid.\n\n60 Lanoszka (n 58).\n\n61 See Michael N.

In late 2019, as Britain was going to the polls to try and break the Brexit deadlock in their parliament, both of Britain's major political parties, the Conservative Party as well as the Labour Party, were hit with back to back cyber-attacks. A series of three cyber-attacks in quick succession bombarded the parties' digital platforms, including a sophisticated distributed-denial-of-service ('DDOS') attack on the Labour Party's platform.62 The attacks came in the wake of British security agencies warning that Russia and other countries could attempt to disrupt the vote on December 12.63\n\nLet us assume that these operations were conducted by a State. The attacks significantly disrupted the operations of Britain's largest political parties and effectively limited their abilities at a crucial time, just weeks before a significant vote on a major political issue. Firstly, the DDOS attack as well as the other cyber-attacks caused their websites to be flooded with online traffic in an attempt to force them offline.64 The operations resulted in tangible, physical manifestations on the cyber-infrastructure that restricted the parties' abilities to reach out to their supporters and operate normally, and therefore reached the threshold required to meet the coercion requirement. Their impact was coercive in this sense, unlike most disinformation operations colloquially referred to as 'fake news' whose impact is largely cognitive without being coercive as understood in international law. They may have ultimately not had any impact on the election, but the coercive requirement is satisfied since it limited or restrained the parties' abilities to reach out to the electorate and function optimally at a vital point in time.65 This effectively translated to limiting the State's ability to serve its electorate in a very real and tangible sense and therefore sufficiently meets the coercion threshold for the purposes of the intervention rule. That the parties' cyber-infrastructure does not constitute the State's cyber-infrastructure (in a sense, the ruling party's cyber-infrastructure) may not matter, given that during election-time in any country, there is a blurring between the identities of the State, the political parties and the electorate. Secondly, the operations targeted political parties' cyber-infrastructure not long before the people would get together to vote on a major issue pertaining to Britain's political system which being Britain's sole prerogative, fell within its domaine reserve. There is thus a strong case to be made that the operations on the Labour and Conservative Parties in Britain amounted to intervention if they were conducted by another State. Russia, to nobody's surprise, has denied the charge.66\n\nMuch more difficult to characterize are disinformation operations by States that solely disseminate distorted facts, data or information to achieve outcomes. According\n\n62 Jack Stubbs, ‘Hackers hit UK political parties with back-to-back cyberattacks’ (Reuters, 12 November 2019) <https: article=\"\" us-britain-election-labour-cyber-iduskbn1xm19l=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n\n63 ibid.\n\n64 ibid.\n\n65 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 52.\n\n66 Stubbs (n 62).</https:>",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nto Prof. Schmitt, the Russian fake accounts feigning American citizenship and sowing disinformation among the electorate is a good candidate for prohibited intervention because it ensured that the electorate could not ‘fairly evaluate the information provided’.67 For him, the deception played by the Russian trolls with respect to their identity is what distinguishes their actions from plain interference.68\n\nWhile the focus on this kind of deception is understandable, it is still too broad and stretches the extant understanding of coercion to its limits. Even if Russian trolls were masquerading online as Americans and were busily spreading disinformation under this cover, they were not restricting access to other sources of information that could be genuine and therefore, it is difficult to believe they compelled or restrained the electorate’s choice of actions, such as with respect to evaluating the correctness of the disinformation. It is even harder to determine that it impacted the electorate’s actual choice of voting. Ultimately, the deception is not forcing anybody to do anything, nor is it preventing authentication of the information through other sources. This approach also calls for disclosure of identity, which comes perilously close to endangering a right to anonymity online, which in today’s world is essential to exercising the right to freedom of expression.69 A potential solution to this problem is discussed in Part IV of the paper.\n\n## B. Lack of Clarity in States’ Views\n\nCustomary international law develops from consistent practice of States that flows from a sense of obligation.70 But proponents of the intervention prohibition applying to subversive information operations in cyberspace will be hard-pressed to point to any state practice for support. Indeed States rarely declare a cyber operation to be illegal or a violation of international law at all. There could be several reasons for this. A State could remain silent for strategic reasons. Often, acknowledging that a cyber operation has occurred could result in revealing the victim State’s own cyber capabilities, including its weaknesses. India’s initial reluctance in admitting a cyber-malware had infected its nuclear power plant in Kudankulam is an example. The government denied that anything was out of the ordinary with the power plant and only admitted that a malware infection in the plant had been identified after third party cybersecurity experts highlighted the issue on Twitter and the public eye became trained on the authorities seeking information.71\n\n67 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 51.\n68 ibid.\n69 UNCHR ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression’ (2015) UN Doc A/HRC/29/32 para 16.\n70 Statute of the International Court of Justice (entered into force 18 April 1946) art 38.\n71 Aditi Agrawal and Nikhil Pahwa, ‘Lt Gen.

    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nSimilar was the case with Iran's denial that Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon that was found in Iran's nuclear power plant at its Natanz facility, had anything to do with damage to its centrifuges causing a major setback to its nuclear programme.72 Admitting the consequences of, or even the occurrence of a cyber operation could be an admission of weakness, both domestically and internationally.\n\nEven when States do speak out, their statements often do not lend much clarity to the understanding of international law in cyberspace. For instance, the US government's statement attributing the infamous Sony hack to North Korea does not identify any particular international obligation that was violated beyond stating that the action fell 'outside the bounds of acceptable state behaviour'.73 The DNC hack, while vehemently attributed to Russia, was also only termed a 'violation of established international norms of behaviour' by the US government.74 The DNC example is particularly relevant since according to scholars it is the closest example of a prohibited intervention. But beyond conveying that these kinds of State actions could be violations of international law, the contribution of these statements towards clarifying the applicable norms of international law is questionable.\n\nOne reason for this could be that States themselves are unsure of the content and contours of international law in cyberspace and this uncertainty prevents them from clearly identifying an international obligation that is violated by the cyber operation.75 Another reason could be that identifying specific obligations that cyber operations violate could tie their own hands and restrict the range of options available to them to strategically operate in cyberspace.76 This is not something States would want. Obviously, these reasons ensure that cyberspace remains inconducive to the proliferation of frequent or consistent State practice, making it all the more difficult to argue convincingly that disinformation operations or the like could violate any international obligation in cyberspace, much less the prohibition on intervention.\n\nAt the same time, having acknowledged the need to give body to the nebulous sphere of international law in cyberspace, international fora have begun calling on States to articulate\n\narticle29834644.ece&gt; accessed 30 July 2020.\n72 William Yong, 'Iran Denies Malware Connection to Nuclear Delay' (The New York Times, 5 October 2010) <https: 06=\"\" 10=\"\" 2010=\"\" middleeast=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\" world=\"\"> accessed 30 July 2020.\n73 Staff Reporter, 'The Interview: North Korea responsible for 'destructive' Sony hack says FBI' (ABC News, 20 December 2014) <https: 2014-12-20=\"\" news=\"\" north-korea-behind-sony-hack-says-united-states=\"\" 5980794=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.\n74 Office of the Press Secretary (n 8).\n75 See generally, Michael N.

    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nexplanatory statements so far.\n\nWhile these official statements are most certainly a positive development which shed some light on States' views on the subject, even their contribution cannot be exaggerated at least as far as the intervention rule is concerned. Expressing the view that ‘external, coercive intervention in the matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty…’ are illegal, the UK states that ‘the practical application of the principle in this context would be the use by a hostile state of cyber operations to manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of our financial system’.⁸⁹ The nature of the cyber operations that could cause these effects is left unclarified. Hence it is not clear whether the UK believes that cyber operations that operate solely through cognitive effects (without being coercive) such as social media disinformation campaigns, could violate the intervention rule. The Netherlands also acknowledges the applicability of the intervention prohibition to cyberspace and specifies national elections as falling within the domain reserve of a state. However, the statement also notes the lack of clarity on the meaning of coercion as well as its resultant impact on the meaning of unauthorized intervention.⁹⁰ France’s statement,⁹¹ while detailed, also does not spell out the circumstances in which it believes the intervention rule is violated, nor does Estonia’s,⁹² which contains spells out generally the rules of international law applicable to cyberspace. Finland’s view is that ‘hostile interference by cyber means’ may breach the intervention rule provided that it is done with the ‘purpose of compelling or coercing that State in relation to affairs regarding which it has free choice’.⁹³ This does not clarify how either Australia’s statement on the issue, first released in the form of an annex to its international cyber engagement strategy, does not even mention the intervention rule.⁹⁴ A subsequent document submitted by the Australian government to the OEWG deals with the issue, in which it provides case studies on the application of international law in cyberspace. However, the case study it chooses for the intervention prohibition illustrates it as ‘a series of cyber operations that prevent the use of the website and disable government systems of State A’s tax office and corporate regulator… As a result [of which] State A is incapable of regulating companies’ compliance with the new laws for a substantial period and has no choice but to indefinitely postpone implementation of the new tax reforms’.⁹⁵ The document also refers to and supports the\n\n⁸⁹ Wright (n 79).\n\n⁹⁰ The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs (n 80).\n\n⁹¹ Government of France, Ministry of Defence (n 81).\n\n⁹² Kersti Kaljulaid (n 86).\n\n⁹³ Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs (n 85).\n\n⁹⁴ Government of Australia (n 83).\n\n⁹⁵ Government of Australia, ‘Australia Non Paper - Case Studies on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (2020) Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, 2 <https: australias-oewg-non-paper-case-studies-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2021.</https:>",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nUK's position that manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another state, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of financial systems constitutes intervention.96 Israel's statement also reiterates this view.97\n\nIran has categorically acknowledged that non-forcible information influence operations could violate the intervention prohibition.98 It clearly states that 'Measures like cyber manipulation of elections or engineering the public opinions on the eve of the elections may be constituted of the examples of gross intervention' and that 'Cyber activities paralyzing websites in a state to provoke internal tensions and conflicts or sending mass messages in a widespread manner to the voters to affect the result of the elections in other states is also considered as the forbidden intervention'.99 It is important to note, however, that this application of the intervention prohibition is still restricted to election scenarios. Therefore, how far this statement can be extrapolated to non-election scenarios is questionable. According to New Zealand as well, 'coercion can be direct or indirect and may range from dictatorial threats to more subtle means of control', and has cited as an example a 'prolonged and coordinated cyber disinformation operation that significantly undermines a state's public health efforts during a pandemic'.100 The other examples cited include deliberate manipulation of the vote tally or depriving a significant part of the electorate of the ability to vote in an election.101 The former example is a clear indication that online disinformation operations can constitute prohibited intervention, but the threshold is less clear.\n\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the merits of the argument in international law, given States' reticence on these issues, these statements are a welcome addition which informs our understanding on how international law applies to cyberspace.\n\nAs is evident, the positions of these States on the contours of the intervention rule in cyberspace are not uniform. They do reflect a propensity among States to consider election interference as intervention, but with the exception of Iran, the forms of election interference that would be considered as intervention are not clear from these statements. In fact, the case study chosen by Australia, if anything, lends support to the argument that coercive intervention in cyberspace needs to entail actual compellance, given the disabling of the website and disabling of government systems. New Zealand's statement comes closest to outlawing disinformation operations by States through the intervention prohibition outside electoral interference, and it will be interesting to see how many other countries feel similarly.\n\n96 ibid 10.\n97 Schöndorf (n 88).\n98 General Staff of Iranian Armed Forces (n 84).\n99 ibid.\n100 Government of New Zealand (n 87).\n101 ibid.",
    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nIn any case, the status of these statements in international law is also unclear. Arguably, they constitute *opinio juris*, which by itself is insufficient to create a norm of customary international law. Scholars will therefore have to wait a little more before they can rely on the emergence of a customary norm to argue that information influence operations can violate the intervention rule.\n\n## C. Difficulties in Attribution\n\nEven if information influence operations could amount to intervention in international law, they will still need to be attributed to a particular State for it to be an actionable internationally wrongful act. Under Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, the conduct of a State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law even if such action was *ultra vires*.¹⁰² Hence, an information influence operation that can be traced to governmental agencies or departments will result in the operation being attributed to the State. However, by their very nature, these influence operations could involve State-owned media. For instance, Sputnik and RT News are Russian controlled state agencies that played a major role in fuelling false news in the Lisa case, a disinformation incident in Germany involving a fake story about a missing Russian-German girl, Lisa, who had reportedly been raped by Arab merchants.¹⁰³ The German police were able to confirm that this news was false and that she had been with a friend that night, but Russian outlets extensively amplified the incident promoting speculation and rumour, leading to a Russian government official expressing concern at the competence of the German police, causing diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia.¹⁰⁴\n\nAssuming for a moment that the Russian actions in the Lisa case were internationally wrongful, could the actions of Sputnik and RT News be attributed to the Russian government? Although international law recognizes the separate identities of corporates at the national level,¹⁰⁵ if the State is using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of the corporation can be attributed to the State.¹⁰⁶ If it could be proved that the Russian government was using its control over Sputnik and RT News to deliberately propagate false news in the Lisa incident, then their actions are attributable to the Russian government. But this is likely to be a question of fact and proving it would be no easy task.\n\n¹⁰² International Law Commission., ‘Report on the Work of its 53rd Session: Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) UN Doc A/56/10, 26.\n\n¹⁰³ Stefan Meister, ‘The ‘Lisa case’: Germany as a target of Russian disinformation’ (NATO Review, 25 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 2016=\"\" 25=\"\" articles=\"\" the-lisa-case-germany-as-a-target-of-russian-disinformation=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 21 August 2020.\n\n¹⁰⁴ ibid.\n\n¹⁰⁵ Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain) (Merits) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 [56], [58].\n\n¹⁰⁶ Foremost Tehran, Inc. v Iran (1986) 10 Iran-USCTR 228; American Bell International Inc. v Iran (1986) 12 Iran-USCTR 170.</https:>",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nThe question becomes even more fraught when it comes to non-State agencies, such as the use of non-State online trolls in the case of social media influence campaigns. Leaving aside legal attribution, even simply identifying individual identities behind the campaign is not without obstacles, and not just technical ones. Anonymity is taken seriously on these platforms whose models involve their users being able to express themselves online without disclosing their real identities. This can be weaponized and misused with great effect in State-sponsored influence campaigns. Twitter, for example, allows the same person to create and tweet from multiple accounts, whether through aliases or through their real names. A combination of IP spoofing and using a fake account on Twitter could allow a Chinese person in Shanghai to effectively portray himself as a British citizen online. The structure of platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, allows thousands of these accounts to be able to successfully mask their identities to an extent. Even assuming these accounts can be unmasked, attributing their actions to any State is currently next to impossible. Under extant international law, a non-State actor's actions can only be attributed to a State if it was under the 'effective control' of the particular State. Originally articulated in the Nicaragua decision, the ICJ expounded further on this test in the Genocide judgement in which it stated that 'it must however be shown that this 'effective control' was exercised, or that the State's instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations'.[107] Obviously, showing that online trolls were instructed by the Russian government to carry out information influence operations is a very tall order.\n\nOf course, these problems are just with the rules of attribution in cyberspace. Even after crossing this hurdle, proving the attributed act in any international court or tribunal under the requisite evidentiary thresholds is an entirely different matter. Currently, the only form of evidence available in cyberspace appears to be the circumstantial kind, which is not likely to be accepted by a forum like the ICJ which demands 'clear and convincing' evidence to prove a violation of the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4).[108] Given that in Nicaragua the ICJ treated the use of force and intervention prohibitions comparably,[109] and the fact that an act of prohibited intervention is a highly serious violation of international law in its own right, the evidentiary threshold is likely to be appropriately high, making it all the more difficult to prove a claim of prohibited intervention in cyberspace.[110]\n\nAdditionally, social media companies will also have to play an important role in attributing any State-sponsored or conducted influence operations. Their cooperation\n\n107 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, 169.\n108 Nicaragua (n 9) [24], [29], [62], [109].\n109 ibid [195].\n110 See generally, Sharngan Aravindakshan, 'Cyberattacks: A Look at Evidentiary Thresholds in International Law' (2021) 59 Indian Journal of International Law 285-299.",
    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n129\n\nwill be vital. Interestingly, apart from disinformation that is especially harmful such as those related to coronavirus and so on, a social media influence campaign (whether State-sponsored or not) can very often violate the platform's own rules or terms of service. Under Facebook's terms of service, this kind of influence operation is called 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour', which according to Facebook, is when 'people...coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing..'.[111] However, ordinarily, Facebook's response to these operations is merely to take down the posts constituting these operations and not investigate further or enquire into details such as whether they are foreign or domestic.[112]\n\nIt is easy to see that attributing information influence operations to any State will present an especially difficult challenge. A recent report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in the UK indicates that there was no assessment of Russian attempts at interference post the EU referendum.[113] Scholars have noted that US intelligence agencies attributing the actions of the online trolls and the Internet Research Agency to Russia can only be deemed reasonable at best and was not an exercise in applying the strict legal tests under the law of State responsibility.[114] It is hard enough to attribute a cyber operation that has tangible, physical effects. Even the distributed-denial-of-service attacks that crippled Estonia's networks bringing down banking services, government systems and news agencies, were never officially attributed to Russia even though Kremlin was widely believed to have orchestrated them through non-state hacking groups, on account of lack of proof.[115] This state of affairs is not set to change any time soon, least of all for nebulous, State-conducted influence campaigns in cyberspace.\n\n## PART III\n\n## Why the Intervention Prohibition?\n\nBut why is so much focus being placed on the intervention prohibition in any case? After all, States have agreed by now that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace. The 2015 GGE Report states that 'State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by States of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory'.[116] The OEWG has also\n\n111 Nathaniel Gleicher, ‘Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior’ (Facebook, 8 July 2020) <https: 07=\"\" 2020=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" about.fb.com=\"\" removing-political-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 21 August 2020.\n\n112 ibid.\n\n113 Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, Russia (HC 2020, 632) para 47.\n\n114 Schmitt ‘Virtual’ Disenfranchisement (n 7) 63.\n\n115 Damien McGuinness, ‘How a cyber attack transformed Estonia’ (BBC News, 27 April 2017) <https: 39655415=\"\" news=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\"> accessed 31 July 2020.\n\n116 UNGA ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174 para 27.</https:>",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nnoted that ‘specific principles of the UN Charter...includ[ing] sovereign equality’ are applicable to cyberspace.¹¹⁷ If States exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace, surely it means by extension that their sovereignty can be ‘violated’ and such a violation would be considered an internationally wrongful act? Why resort to other internationally wrongful acts such as intervention?\n\nThis view of ‘sovereignty’ as a primary rule capable of being violated is the basis for the ICJ’s ruling in its very first contentious case - the Corfu Channel case. In Corfu Channel, the ICJ recognized respect for territorial sovereignty of States as an essential foundation of international relations and concluded that the action of the British Navy in question constituted a ‘violation of Albanian sovereignty’.¹¹⁸\n\nLater in Nicaragua, the ICJ again held that ‘the assistance to the contras, as well as the direct attacks on Nicaraguan ports, oil installations, etc., . . . not only amount to an unlawful use of force, but also constitute infringements of the territorial sovereignty of Nicaragua, and incursions into its territorial and internal waters’.¹¹⁹ In this case, the ICJ also ruled that territorial sovereignty is ‘directly infringed’ by the unauthorized overflight of a State’s territory by aircraft belonging to or under the control of the government of another State.¹²⁰ Importantly, the ICJ acknowledged in the Nicaragua case that a violation of sovereignty was an internationally wrongful act independent of prohibited intervention and use of force, even though the content of the principle inevitably overlaps with the other two internationally wrongful acts.¹²¹\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom’s Attorney General while setting out the United Kingdom’s position on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, questioned the applicability of territorial sovereignty to cyberspace. Despite noting that sovereignty is ‘fundamental’ to the international rules-based system, he stated that ‘I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyberactivity beyond that of a prohibited intervention. The UK Government’s position is therefore that there is no such rule as a matter of current international law’.¹²² This position is supported and fleshed out by Gary Corn and Robert Taylor who argue that rather than a rule which if violated would entail consequences, sovereignty is a ‘baseline principle’ that gives rise to binding rules such as the prohibition on the use of force and the intervention prohibition.¹²³ They dispute that sovereignty is itself a binding rule of international law that precludes any action by one State in the territory of another without\n\n¹¹⁷ Open-Ended Working Group Second ‘Pre-Draft’ (n 77) para 27.\n¹¹⁸ Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) 1949 ICJ Rep 4.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 9) [251].\n¹²⁰ ibid.\n¹²¹ ibid.\n¹²² Wright (n 79).\n¹²³ Gary P.

They point to the heavy emphasis of State sovereignty over its airspace, which is treated as highly restricted with no incursions usually being permitted unless it is in self-defence or under authorization from the Security Council, as compared to a lesser emphasis in a State's territorial waters which may be traversed by other States under certain conditions such as a right of innocent passage, and the complete absence of sovereignty in space, which is treated as a ‘common heritage of mankind’.¹²⁶ They also point to the status of espionage, an act that conventionally involves either the unauthorized presence of the operatives of a foreign State or conduct of unauthorized activities in the territory of another State, which is not regulated by international law, as another example of how there is no operation of any sovereignty ‘rule’.¹²⁷ As Corn and Taylor were senior legal advisors to the US government at the time their article was published, their view can be assumed to reflect US thinking, if not the US government’s official position.\n\nIt is equally noteworthy that the Netherlands has openly declared its opposition to this interpretation, and has stated that it considers sovereignty an ‘obligation in its own right, the violation of which may in turn constitute an internationally wrongful act’.¹²⁸ France¹²⁹ and Iran,¹³⁰ too, have echoed this view.\n\nA discussion on the merits of this argument is beyond the scope of this article. But it is important to note that accepting the UK’s understanding of sovereignty in cyberspace has far reaching implications. In the absence of a treaty or any other regime governing cyberspace, a cyber-attack in another State’s territory that does not reach the levels of intervention or a use of force will in essence be permitted in international law. Further, importantly, while conventional espionage is generally accepted as not regulated by international law, the case is very different with cyber-espionage.¹³¹ But if this view is accepted, cyber-espionage can also be considered legal.

The malware in question was a variant of the D-Track virus, known to have data exfiltration capabilities.¹³² The United Kingdom and possibly the United States contesting the existence of a rule as basic as sovereignty in cyberspace has not only flown in the face of established ICJ jurisprudence as explained above, but has also thrown a spanner in the development of a common understanding of how international law applies to cyberspace.\n\nThis contestation has injected much uncertainty into States’ understanding of sovereignty, making the application of a sovereignty rule to State-sponsored disinformation operations difficult to the extent they are conducted in cyberspace. These operations are also unlikely to cross the threshold of the use of force or armed attack, both of which require the causation of significant damage.¹³³\n\nBesides sovereignty, other applicable rules that States’ disinformation operations potentially implicate are the right to self-determination, particularly in election scenarios, and the right to free speech in international human rights law. The right to self-determination grants a ‘people’ the right to ‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’.¹³⁴ State-sponsored disinformation operations at the time of elections arguably impede the former, inasmuch as it affects the electorate’s ability to impartially elect their own representatives. However, it must be noted that the right to self-determination is best applied to a ‘people’ who have been denied the right to govern themselves, such as a colonized people, for instance, or indigenous people.¹³⁵ It is not clear to what extent it could apply to the citizenry of an independent State that already broadly has this ability and it is even less clear whether it could apply outside of election scenarios. With regard to the right to free speech, Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to freedom of expression, both offline and online. Article 19(2) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that ‘this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.¹³⁶ This right is said to have received customary status, given its inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.¹³⁷ State-sponsored disinformation operations implicate the public’s right to receive information.

    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\nundoubtedly has a ‘right to know’, and therefore has a right to receive ‘correct’ information from the State.¹³⁸ However, it is still heavily contested whether this right is owed to the public by the government of another State. Although the Human Rights Committee’s view is that the ICCPR obligations apply extra-territorially,¹³⁹ they only do so when a State exercises ‘effective control’ over the individuals or the foreign territory concerned. This is usually a difficult criterion to satisfy, especially over the internet. Further, as explained previously using bots and trolls to spread disinformation may not always crowd out other sources of correct information. It would perhaps be a different situation if a State targets the media of another State and somehow impedes their ability to disseminate news, or other forms of information to that State’s public.\n\nGiven these issues, the intervention prohibition still presents a better legal rubric to assess State-sponsored online disinformation operations. Hence, the international law community has turned to the intervention prohibition as a better bet for bringing information influence operations within the ambit of international law.\n\n## PART IV\n\n## A Tailored Deception Test for the Intervention Prohibition in the case of online disinformation operations by States\n\nThe effects of prohibited intervention may be much clearer in cases where certain more trusted, reliable or authoritative sources of information are hijacked, which are then used to purvey disinformation. Consider a State conducting an information operation immediately before an election that, either through unauthorizedly accessing the official social media accounts of senior officials in the US government or impersonating them otherwise online, deliberately spreads incorrect information with the intention of swaying voters one way or another. It may be reasonable to conclude that this amounts to intervention since voters would simply take the information at face value, there being no reason to do otherwise. The likelihood of being influenced by incorrect information also substantially increases in such cases. It may not matter in this case that the transgressing State does not restrict access to genuine sources of information, since by deceptively portraying itself as a genuine source of information, it effectively ensures its intended audience does not feel the need to search out and verify the information from other authentic sources of information. Consider, for instance, if President Trump’s Twitter handle was suddenly hacked by State actors just before an election, who then use it to spread disinformation about the Republican party in the United States. Given President Trump’s position and that he is uniquely placed to be in\n\n¹³⁸ ‘International Standards: Right to Information’ (Article 19, 5 April 2012) <https: international-standards-right-information=\"\" resources=\"\" www.article19.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n\n¹³⁹ Ryan Goodman, ‘UN Human Rights Committee Says ICCPR Applies to Extraterritorial Surveillance: But is that so novel?’ (Just Security, 27 March 2014) <https: 8620=\"\" human-rights-committee-iccpr-applies-extraterritorial-surveillance-novel=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.</https:>",

Even if the deception was quickly identified and the false information denounced, it could be of little relevance since the damage may have already been done.\n\nThis tricky issue is exemplified in scenarios other than just elections. Let us consider a scenario Col. Gary Corn posited as an example of intervention – Russian disinformation operations hampering efforts to effectively fight the Covid-19 pandemic. After concluding that the Russian Kremlin’s disinformation campaigns about the West needed to be challenged, the European Union set up the East StratCom Task Force as a wing of the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’), specifically to raise awareness of as well as counter Russian disinformation. According to a report from the EEAS, Russia’s pro-Kremlin media are propagating conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus was created by humans and weaponized by Western countries. The report claims that ‘the overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems — thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak’.¹⁴⁰ The Global Engagement Centre, an arm of the US State Department aimed at countering foreign disinformation and influence campaigns targeting the US and its allies, also announced findings that there were thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading disinformation about coronavirus.¹⁴¹\n\nBased on these reports, Col. Corn notes the ‘potentially deadly effect’ that the Russian disinformation operations can have during the ongoing pandemic, and that Russia was undermining legitimate efforts to contain the spread and impacts of the lethal virus.¹⁴² He argues that Russia is ‘aiding and abetting the spread of the virus, fully knowing its actions pose a direct threat to people’s lives’ and calls for the intervention rule to be invoked against Russia.¹⁴³ Undoubtedly, ensuring the health of its citizens is a State’s prerogative and can reasonably be concluded to fall within its domain reserve. However, the biggest obstacle to Col. Corn’s argument is that the effect of these operations, whether Russian or not, is essentially cognitive without being coercive. The Russian linked accounts on Facebook and Twitter, although amplifying false information that could lead to US citizens making undesirable choices in dealing with the novel coronavirus and possibly cause\n\n¹⁴⁰ James Frater, Mary Ilyushina and Hadas Gold, ‘EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow ‘panic and fear’ with coronavirus disinformation’ (CNN, 18 March 2020) <https: 03=\"\" 18=\"\" 2020=\"\" europe=\"\" eu-kremlin-disinformation-coronavirus-intl=\"\" index.html=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n\n¹⁴¹ Donie O’Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, ‘Facebook and Twitter ask to see government report linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia’ (CNN, 28 February 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 28=\"\" coronavirus-russia-disinformation-state-department=\"\" index.html=\"\" politics=\"\" www.cnn.com=\"\"> accessed 23 July 2020.\n\n¹⁴² Corn (n 4).\n\n¹⁴³ ibid.</https:></https:>",
    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n\ninterference with US efforts to fight the coronavirus, will still be difficult to qualify as sufficiently coercive as understood in the intervention sense. It is hard to argue that these deceptive accounts, despite being numerous, are crowding out other authentic sources of information that can still be accessed by the people. It is not that the Russian coronavirus disinformation operations are somehow preventing, limiting or restraining its citizenry's ability to access correct facts, data or other information that can help them effectively protect themselves from coronavirus. However, it might be different if these influence operations consisted of illegally accessing the accounts of, or impersonating relevant medical professionals, authoritative news agencies or associated persons, or government officials and then proceeding to dispense false information relating to the pandemic. In such cases, by portraying themselves as authentic, authoritative and reliable sources of information, they are ensuring the dispensing with of the need to have the disseminated information verified. This effectively constrains or hampers the target State's ability to fight the ongoing pandemic.\n\nFocusing on trusted sources such as State or State-affiliated accounts or other prominent figures better fits the intervention prohibition. The influence and reach wielded by these accounts on social media presents a clearer route to effectively intervene in the internal affairs of States. Several of them command hundreds of thousands of followers worldwide on these platforms. By July 2021, the official Twitter handle of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached 57.9 million followers, becoming the second most followed leader on Twitter, behind only the then President Donald Trump with 81.1 million followers. The large follower count is accompanied by outsized, often direct influence on the everyday lives of their followers. Illustratively, Elon Musk's tweets about Bitcoin and Dogecoin directly impact the cryptocurrency market- when he tweeted a Dogecoin meme inspired by the movie Lion-King, Dogecoin's price rose by more than 50%. These accounts are vested with a certain level of trust, reliance and deference upon which their audience often base their own actions. When State actors or State-sponsored actors gain access to these accounts, either through impersonation or by hacking, they can cause significant damage. Although it is not clear whether it is linked to any State, the recent bitcoin scam on Twitter is indicative of this, in which the hacked Twitter accounts of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, among others, were used to call for bitcoin contributions with a promise of doubling them. In only a short while, the scam managed to rake in over a hundred thousand dollars. It is hard to deny that these particular accounts were targeted because they are far more likely to be believed, than bots or other accounts. This argument is also in consonance with emerging research in this area which indicates that verified accounts have more visibility or\n\n144 Andrew Hayward, ‘How Elon Musk’s Tweets Move the Cryptocurrency Market’ (The Motley Fool, 17 June 2021) <https: 06=\"\" 17=\"\" 2021=\"\" how-elon-musk-s-tweets-move-the-cryptocurrency-mark=\"\" www.fool.com=\"\" investing=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.\n\n145 Sneha Saha, ‘Twitter hack: What happened and how Twitter tackled the Bitcoin scam’ (The Indian Express, 18 July 2020) <https: article=\"\" indianexpress.com=\"\" technology=\"\" social=\"\" tether-hacked-what-happened-bitcoin-scam-6508118=\"\"></https:> accessed 2 July 2021.",

Both Facebook¹⁴⁷ and Twitter¹⁴⁸ have a verified account policy for accounts of public interest, according to which a blue-tick badge is displayed next to the handle or name of the account, indicating that the account is authentic, notable and active. Public figures, including current key government officials and offices and accounts representing prominent organizations, brands and individuals, among others, are conferred this badge.¹⁴⁹ There is an expectation on the part of users that information from blue-ticked accounts can be safely relied upon as being from that particular user.\n\nThey are also granted enhanced security measures, in addition to the ‘verified’ status. Twitter recently announced more stringent safeguards for select accounts including requirements to use a strong password, two-factor authentication and password reset protection for these accounts by default.¹⁵⁰ The measures currently apply to accounts belonging to members of the US executive and legislative branches (members of Congress), governors and secretaries of State, political parties and election candidates.¹⁵¹ Similarly, Facebook also offers ‘Facebook Protect’ to ‘certain people such as candidates, elected officials or staff’, especially during election cycles.¹⁵²\n\nThe importance of trusted sources such as government accounts on social media becomes even more important in many countries such as China, where censorship and news regulation mean that the citizenry receives the bulk of its information or news from government sources or State-affiliated media, which have also moved online.

    "Reflections on Information Influence Operations as Illegal Intervention\n137\n\non State-media, both online and offline, means that a successful impersonation or hijacking of their State-media with a view to spread disinformation on an issue such as Covid-19 and vaccination could have catastrophic effects, majorly hindering governmental efforts to handle the Covid crisis and ensure citizens' welfare. Note that the emphasis on trusted sources online including government sources is especially heightened now given the spate of general mis- and dis-information prevailing about the novel coronavirus.\n\nLimiting the test of coercive deception to cases where the intervening State impersonates persons of authority such as government officials may be a better route to arguing information influence operations as prohibited intervention. This also addresses the challenge to the right to anonymity, which does not ordinarily extend to governmental presence online.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nTolerance towards State-sponsored or conducted information influence operations is palpably decreasing among the international community. As Col. Corn pointed out, these operations can sometimes even endanger lives, as in the context of online disinformation pertaining to Covid-19. The intervention prohibition is an attractive candidate among the different rules of international law that States can use to regulate information influence operations.\n\nHowever, as this article argues, the arguments currently made in mainstream scholarship regarding its applicability are not likely to be convincing. Firstly, the understanding of 'coercion' in international law will need to drastically change to accommodate the purely cognitive effects of States' disinformation operations. Secondly, States are still slow to characterize States' disinformation operations as illegal, let alone as illegal interventions, supported by legal justifications, which is what is needed to clarify the content and application of this rule. Thirdly, difficulties in attribution in cyberspace naturally also apply to disinformation operations. Cooperation from social media companies may be vital to States' attribution capabilities with regard to these operations. This article argues that these hurdles will not be easy to cross.\n\nThis article also highlights the problems with the overbroad focus on concealment and deception with respect to identity on the part of the intervening State as a route to reach the requirement of coercion. It is somewhat optimistic to believe that simply because an agency such as Russia's RT or Sputnik transparently disseminates false information, people will be less likely to believe such information. In any case, the option of verifying information as authentic remains with the target population whether the purveyor's identity is concealed or not. Accordingly, by questioning and exploring this relationship between deception and coercion, this article proposes that a finding of prohibited intervention be further narrowed down to where the deception is applied vis-a-vis trusted sources and persons of authority in the target State, since they are easily likely to be considered as",
    "NLUD Journal of Legal Studies\nVol. III\n\nauthentic sources of information, as opposed to other social media ‘bots’ or ‘trolls’ even if they are posing as citizens of the target State. Interdicting the latter will inevitably result in imperilling the right to anonymity online which is essential to exercising the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. A tailored deception test such as the one this article proposes is also more likely to be attractive to States since it appropriately sanctions the actually impactful wrongful action, while at the same time not overburdening States or endangering the right to anonymity.\n\nCyberspace affords more and more tools to States to achieve strategic outcomes without necessarily resorting to forcible means. Several of these operations such as disinformation campaigns operate solely by impacting the cognitive environment in the target State, something that is not directly regulated by the UN Charter. In this vein, it may be worth further exploring the relation between coercion as understood in international law and the cognitive impact that these operations usually have on the target State. While this is a question for future research, States currently have not reached the requisite level of consensus that information influence operations are without a doubt ‘coercive’ or otherwise illegal in international law. At best, it can be said that States have currently recognized such operations to be a problem."
