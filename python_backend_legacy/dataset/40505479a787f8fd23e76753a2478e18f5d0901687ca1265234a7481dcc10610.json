They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\n\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\n\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\n\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n\n2Ibid., 5.\n\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.",

            "markdown": "historical, and cultural factors, PAC signals restraint, not as a deterrent but a risk-management strategy to minimize the scale and aftermath of cyberattacks. Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\n\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\n\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and",

This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\n\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\n\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian",

PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\n\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

They also prefer a narrower definition of cybercrime as cyber-enabled crime, with less emphasis on “false information” as a pretext for prosecution.³⁹ Secondly, it is unclear if cyberattacks constitute aggression under international humanitarian law and what response is appropriate.⁴⁰ Since attackers can use proxy servers of a third country to conduct cyber-operations, attributing blame on a specific government may not be reliable yet can result in severe escalation if the right to self-defense is evoked.⁴¹\n\nIn reality, however, these reasons are of secondary importance. First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India.⁴² Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame.⁴³ As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment.⁴⁴ The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim.⁴⁵ As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat.

Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\n\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\n\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.",

NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\n\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\n\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\n\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\n\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n\n##",

Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\n\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76]\n\n[71] \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n\n[72] \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n\n[73] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n\n[74] Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n\n[75] Ibid.\n\n[76] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A",

The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\n\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\n\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\n\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\n\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\n\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\n\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\n\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\n\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\n\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\n\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n\n^{81}Ibid.\n\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\n\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html",

On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\n\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\n\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\n\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\n\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\n\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors",

Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\n\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm.⁸⁶ Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness.⁸⁷ One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\n\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\n\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n\n⁸⁵ \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n\n⁸⁶ \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n\n⁸⁷ \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.",

In 2020, for instance, economic losses from cybercrime in Russia made up 3.5 trillion rubles, which surpassed government spending on national defense (3 trillion rubles) or law enforcement and national security (2.4 trillion rubles) for the same calendar year.⁸⁹ The monetary costs of rare PAC outweigh the reputational rewards of projecting victimhood in the cyber domain, which Russia, which reports and laments losses from cybercrime, is aware of.\n\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\n\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns.⁹⁰ However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.⁹¹\n\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\n\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states.

The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\n\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly.

At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion.¹⁰⁶ This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability.

It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms.¹⁰⁷ With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.¹⁰⁸\n\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n\n## Implications for Research and Policy\n\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering\n\n¹⁰⁷ State Duma of the Russian Federation, \"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\" [How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/; \"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\" BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n\n¹⁰⁸ Adam Gabbatt, \"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\" The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.",

After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111]\n\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"",

The Russia case of PAC, investigated through criminologically-tuned ST, challenges a popular assumption that state-sponsored cyberattacks are necessarily as much of a security issue for all nations as they are intuitively perceived to be, whether in peacetime or wartime. For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n#\nR.

Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and\nLenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\ndomestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.¹⁶\n## Securitization Theory and Cyberspace\nSecuritization theory (ST) posits that security is a socially constructed, rather than materially given, phenomenon.¹⁷ Securitization, in this sense, is transferring an issue from the realm of normal politics, which refers to the ordinary routines of day-to-day political management of societal issues, to the area of emergency, which necessitates adoption of exceptional measures to counter an existential threat.¹⁸ These measures require suspension of democratic procedures and formalities that, under normal circumstances, place palpable constraints on the behavior of decision-makers.¹⁹ In nondemocratic regimes, exceptional measures may manifest as the bypassing of some established behavioral rules of the polity that usually restrict the leader, including national mantras about their morality or unmistakability, or favorable beliefs toward the leader from key figures in the polity, or internal struggles and antagonisms within the elite.²⁰ To achieve securitization, the securitizing actor makes a pronouncement (speech act) describing specific entity, event, or process as an existential threat to societal interests and well-being.²¹ If the public accepts such a characterization, securitization is deemed successful, and the securitizing actor obtains exceptional powers to act in circumvention of\n¹⁶ Olga Chislova and Marina Sokolova, \"Cybersecurity in Russia,\" International Cybersecurity Law Review 2, no. 2 (July 2021): 245–51; Mari Ristolainen, \"Should 'RuNet 2020' Be Taken Seriously?

KOLODII\ndemocratic checks and balances.[22] Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).[23]\nST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security.³⁰ They infringe upon legally protected proprietary and privacy rights of users and cause major economic losses (standing at $8.15 trillion in 2023, which is five times the combined amount of top ten largest military budgets in the world).³¹ If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n²⁹ Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable.[34] The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach.[35] Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes.[36] As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

They also prefer a narrower definition of cybercrime as cyber-enabled crime, with less emphasis on “false information” as a pretext for prosecution.³⁹ Secondly, it is unclear if cyberattacks constitute aggression under international humanitarian law and what response is appropriate.⁴⁰ Since attackers can use proxy servers of a third country to conduct cyber-operations, attributing blame on a specific government may not be reliable yet can result in severe escalation if the right to self-defense is evoked.⁴¹\nIn reality, however, these reasons are of secondary importance. First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India.⁴² Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame.⁴³ As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment.⁴⁴ The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim.⁴⁵ As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n³⁹ Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n⁴⁰ Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n⁴¹ Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n⁴² “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n⁴³ “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n⁴⁴ Lawrence E.

Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

KOLODII\nexamine this tendency further through a large dataset of media reports regarding Russia's cyber-incident reporting over the decades.\n# Public Attribution of Cyberattacks in Russia: Longitudinal Media Analysis\nFor the purpose of this research, the empirical data on Russia's PAC come from thousands of reports in the online archives of four major Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and Lenta.ru., from early 2000s (depending on archive availability—1999 for Lenta.ru, 2003 for Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2007 for RIA Novosti, and 2013 for TASS) through January 2022 (before Russia's invasion of Ukraine). These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n##\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nThe Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76]\n[71] \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n[72] \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n[73] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n[74] Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n[75] Ibid.\n[76] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A\nIn none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n^{81}Ibid.\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html\nThis reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors\n660\nR. KOLODII\n(e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.⁸⁵\nHypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm.⁸⁶ Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness.⁸⁷ One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n⁸⁵ \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n⁸⁶ \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n⁸⁷ \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n661\naccepts its limitations and asks the public for vigilance.⁸⁸ Conversely, embracing Western cyberattacks and eschewing PAC and reprisal may invite further cyber-intrusions and aggravate risks associated with their devastating repercussions. In 2020, for instance, economic losses from cybercrime in Russia made up 3.5 trillion rubles, which surpassed government spending on national defense (3 trillion rubles) or law enforcement and national security (2.4 trillion rubles) for the same calendar year.⁸⁹ The monetary costs of rare PAC outweigh the reputational rewards of projecting victimhood in the cyber domain, which Russia, which reports and laments losses from cybercrime, is aware of.\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns.⁹⁰ However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.⁹¹\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. This theory posits that a country's attitude toward state-sponsored cybercrime is a\n⁸⁸ \"Genprokuratura Podgotovila Mery Po Bor'be S Kiberprestupnost'yu V Rossii\" [The Prosecutor General's Office Has Prepared Measures to Combat Cybercrime in Russia], TASS, July 23, 2020, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9032391.\n⁸⁹ TASS, \"Sberbank\"; Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, \"Byudzhet Dlya Grazhdan\" [Budget for the Citizens], 2019, https://minfin.gov.ru/common/upload/library/2019/12/main/Budzhet_dlya_grazhdan_2020-2022.pdf: 5.\n⁹⁰ Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n⁹¹ \"Moskva Vysylaet Desyatki Evropeiskikh Diplomatov\" [Moscow Expels Dozens of European Diplomats], BBC, 30 March 2018, https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-43580909; Shaun Walker, \"Russia Arrests Wall Street Journal Reporter and Accuses Him of Espionage,\" The Guardian, March 30, 2023, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich; \"Khronologiya Vvedeniya Sanktsii I Otvetnye Mery Rossii V 2014-2015 Godakh\" [Chronology of Sanctions and Russia's Response in 2014-2015], RIA Novosti, November 25, 2015, https://ria.ru/20151125/1328470681.html.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nresult of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field.[92] However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks  $8^{\\text{th}}$  behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks  $28^{\\text{th}}$  (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is  $48^{\\text{th}}$  (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at  $37^{\\text{th}}$  among 37 economies (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs.[93] Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$ , the United States is  $16^{\\text{th}}$ , top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around  $2\\%$ , while some US allies boast above  $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies).[94] Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall  $46^{\\text{th}}$  among 129 economies (the United States is  $3^{\\text{rd}}$ , top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure\n92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk, \"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\" NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%).⁹⁷ The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon.⁹⁸ As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies.⁹⁹ Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.¹⁰⁰\nGiven these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII\noperations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry\n101Massimo Pellegrino, \"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\" European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle, \"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\" Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino, \"The Threat,\" 1.\n^{102}\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\" October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center, \"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\" 2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n^{103}\nRyan Brown, \"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\" CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n^{104}\nJoel Brenner, \"The New Industrial Espionage,\" The American Interest 10, no. 3 (December 2014): 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nransomware attack in 2017.¹⁰⁵ The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion.¹⁰⁶ This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and\n¹⁰⁵ Ellen Nakashima, \"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html; \"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\" The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n¹⁰⁶ Andrew Dawson, \"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\" The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2 (April-June 2019): 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas, \"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\" Social Media + Society 5, no. 3 (August 2019): 11.\n666\nR.

It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms.¹⁰⁷ With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.¹⁰⁸\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West.

After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111]\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"\n#\nR.

Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nsanctions against respective government and state-affiliated institutions, companies, and individuals, blocking of financial assets and prohibition of transactions, including for third parties, and indictments of foreign government employees, for example, Russian and Chinese military officers implicated in cyberattacks.5 PAC has become an important foreign policy instrument of Western states, but what exactly are its key strategic effects?\nThe extant literature on the politics of PAC, scarce as it is, emphasizes PAC's deterrent function of intimidating state actors and their proxies responsible for cyberattacks, or justifying robust political response against perpetrators through denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos.6 Apart from deterrence, PAC boasts coercive potential for exposing wrongdoers publicly and, where possible, apprehending them, as well as showcasing the country's detection capabilities.7 It also has an expressive function of communicating the rules of the game in cyberspace and roles of the parties involved, which helps shape operational and normative environment of cyberattacks.8 However, the deterrent, coercive, and expressive effects of PAC do not ensue automatically, as what decides the expediency of PAC is first and foremost the incurred damage, financial, physical, or reputational.9 Importantly, deterrence through PAC has its downsides, as states tend to prioritize attribution and punishment for cyberattacks directed against their critical economic or military assets.10 Consequently, such high-value targets receive more investment in cyber-incident prevention and management and are more likely to generate political pressure from the public to retaliate, leaving vulnerabilities of low-value targets under-addressed.11 Also, PAC often foments a sense of urgency to provide more evidence to the public or right away resort to indictments, sanctions, or cyber-actions against perpetrators.12 This all may clash with the interests of decision-makers and dissuade them from PAC, thus emboldening future attacks and public anger at exploitation.13 As a result, for some societies that are particularly averse to risk and uncertainty due to societal,\n\nhistorical, and cultural factors, PAC signals restraint, not as a deterrent but a risk-management strategy to minimize the scale and aftermath of cyberattacks. Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and\nLenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\ndomestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.\n## Securitization Theory and Cyberspace\nSecuritization theory (ST) posits that security is a socially constructed, rather than materially given, phenomenon. Securitization, in this sense, is transferring an issue from the realm of normal politics, which refers to the ordinary routines of day-to-day political management of societal issues, to the area of emergency, which necessitates adoption of exceptional measures to counter an existential threat. These measures require suspension of democratic procedures and formalities that, under normal circumstances, place palpable constraints on the behavior of decision-makers. In nondemocratic regimes, exceptional measures may manifest as the bypassing of some established behavioral rules of the polity that usually restrict the leader, including national mantras about their morality or unmistakability, or favorable beliefs toward the leader from key figures in the polity, or internal struggles and antagonisms within the elite. To achieve securitization, the securitizing actor makes a pronouncement (speech act) describing specific entity, event, or process as an existential threat to societal interests and well-being. If the public accepts such a characterization, securitization is deemed successful, and the securitizing actor obtains exceptional powers to act in circumvention of\n Olga Chislova and Marina Sokolova, \"Cybersecurity in Russia,\" International Cybersecurity Law Review 2, no. 2 (July 2021): 245–51; Mari Ristolainen, \"Should 'RuNet 2020' Be Taken Seriously?

KOLODII\ndemocratic checks and balances.[22] Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).[23]\nST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security. They infringe upon legally protected proprietary and privacy rights of users and cause major economic losses (standing at $8.15 trillion in 2023, which is five times the combined amount of top ten largest military budgets in the world). If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable.[34] The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach.[35] Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes.[36] As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India. Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame. As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment. The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim. As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n Lawrence E.

KOLODII\nwhich is largely unaddressed and unregulated by international law. $^{46}$  Cyberespionage, in this regard, allows nations to eavesdrop on each other, collect valuable intelligence, and steal strategically important information, such as classified documents or trade secrets, all without fear of international retribution. $^{47}$  If victim states refrain from deliberate escalation after exposing foreign digital espionage, the latter might provide potential reassurance as a form of confidence-building measure, leading to greater strategic stability among nations. $^{48}$  Moreover, statistical data suggest that on a 5-point severity scale, where 5 presents maximum severity, the average score for all cyber incidents is 1.62 and for cyber disputes is 1.71, which makes cyberattacks somewhat palatable. $^{49}$  Destructive cyberattacks, in turn, help countries test their cyberweapons in preparation for potential future conflict with a pronounced cyber dimension. Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n##\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nThe Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76]\n[71] \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n[72] \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n[73] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n[74] Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n[75] Ibid.\n[76] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A\nIn none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n^{81}Ibid.\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html\nThis reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors\n\n(e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.\nHypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm. Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness. One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns. However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. This theory posits that a country's attitude toward state-sponsored cybercrime is a\n \"Genprokuratura Podgotovila Mery Po Bor'be S Kiberprestupnost'yu V Rossii\" [The Prosecutor General's Office Has Prepared Measures to Combat Cybercrime in Russia], TASS, July 23, 2020, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9032391.\n TASS, \"Sberbank\"; Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, \"Byudzhet Dlya Grazhdan\" [Budget for the Citizens], 2019, https://minfin.gov.ru/common/upload/library/2019/12/main/Budzhet_dlya_grazhdan_2020-2022.pdf: 5.\n Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n \"Moskva Vysylaet Desyatki Evropeiskikh Diplomatov\" [Moscow Expels Dozens of European Diplomats], BBC, 30 March 2018, https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-43580909; Shaun Walker, \"Russia Arrests Wall Street Journal Reporter and Accuses Him of Espionage,\" The Guardian, March 30, 2023, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich; \"Khronologiya Vvedeniya Sanktsii I Otvetnye Mery Rossii V 2014-2015 Godakh\" [Chronology of Sanctions and Russia's Response in 2014-2015], RIA Novosti, November 25, 2015, https://ria.ru/20151125/1328470681.html.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nresult of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field.[92] However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks  $8^{\\text{th}}$  behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks  $28^{\\text{th}}$  (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is  $48^{\\text{th}}$  (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at  $37^{\\text{th}}$  among 37 economies (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs.[93] Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$ , the United States is  $16^{\\text{th}}$ , top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around  $2\\%$ , while some US allies boast above  $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies).[94] Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall  $46^{\\text{th}}$  among 129 economies (the United States is  $3^{\\text{rd}}$ , top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure\n92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk, \"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\" NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

The country has also scored only 29ᵗʰ in artificial intelligence (AI) government readiness (the United States is 4ᵗʰ, top 8 countries are US allies), having designated only $12.5 million a year on AI research compared to $1.1 billion spent by the United States in 2019 and focusing primarily on AI-related education and military operations rather than its large-scale commercial application that ensured the West's current leadership in this area.\nRussia is also heavily dependent on Western high-tech expertise and technology. Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%). The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon. As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies. Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.\nGiven these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII\noperations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry\n101Massimo Pellegrino, \"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\" European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle, \"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\" Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino, \"The Threat,\" 1.\n^{102}\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\" October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center, \"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\" 2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n^{103}\nRyan Brown, \"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\" CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n^{104}\nJoel Brenner, \"The New Industrial Espionage,\" The American Interest 10, no. 3 (December 2014): 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nransomware attack in 2017. The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion. This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and\n Ellen Nakashima, \"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html; \"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\" The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n Andrew Dawson, \"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\" The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2 (April-June 2019): 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas, \"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\" Social Media + Society 5, no. 3 (August 2019): 11.\n\n375-FZ (2016) that oblige operators and Internet companies to store users' correspondence; Russia's Federal Laws N139-FZ (2012), and N398-FZ (2013) enabling Rozkomnadzor to blacklist and block websites; and the Federal Law N276-FZ (2017) that prevents users from accessing banned content through VPN or proxy services. It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms. With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering\n State Duma of the Russian Federation, \"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\" [How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/; \"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\" BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n Adam Gabbatt, \"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\" The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nharm from foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks—to refrain from public attribution of such attacks and subsequent retaliation.\nHas the invasion of Ukraine in any way impacted Russia's approach to PAC? After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111]\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"\n#\nR.

For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nsanctions against respective government and state-affiliated institutions, companies, and individuals, blocking of financial assets and prohibition of transactions, including for third parties, and indictments of foreign government employees, for example, Russian and Chinese military officers implicated in cyberattacks.5 PAC has become an important foreign policy instrument of Western states, but what exactly are its key strategic effects?\nThe extant literature on the politics of PAC, scarce as it is, emphasizes PAC's deterrent function of intimidating state actors and their proxies responsible for cyberattacks, or justifying robust political response against perpetrators through denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos.6 Apart from deterrence, PAC boasts coercive potential for exposing wrongdoers publicly and, where possible, apprehending them, as well as showcasing the country's detection capabilities.7 It also has an expressive function of communicating the rules of the game in cyberspace and roles of the parties involved, which helps shape operational and normative environment of cyberattacks.8 However, the deterrent, coercive, and expressive effects of PAC do not ensue automatically, as what decides the expediency of PAC is first and foremost the incurred damage, financial, physical, or reputational.9 Importantly, deterrence through PAC has its downsides, as states tend to prioritize attribution and punishment for cyberattacks directed against their critical economic or military assets.10 Consequently, such high-value targets receive more investment in cyber-incident prevention and management and are more likely to generate political pressure from the public to retaliate, leaving vulnerabilities of low-value targets under-addressed.11 Also, PAC often foments a sense of urgency to provide more evidence to the public or right away resort to indictments, sanctions, or cyber-actions against perpetrators.12 This all may clash with the interests of decision-makers and dissuade them from PAC, thus emboldening future attacks and public anger at exploitation.13 As a result, for some societies that are particularly averse to risk and uncertainty due to societal,\n\nhistorical, and cultural factors, PAC signals restraint, not as a deterrent but a risk-management strategy to minimize the scale and aftermath of cyberattacks. Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and\nLenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\ndomestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.\n## Securitization Theory and Cyberspace\nSecuritization theory (ST) posits that security is a socially constructed, rather than materially given, phenomenon. Securitization, in this sense, is transferring an issue from the realm of normal politics, which refers to the ordinary routines of day-to-day political management of societal issues, to the area of emergency, which necessitates adoption of exceptional measures to counter an existential threat. These measures require suspension of democratic procedures and formalities that, under normal circumstances, place palpable constraints on the behavior of decision-makers. In nondemocratic regimes, exceptional measures may manifest as the bypassing of some established behavioral rules of the polity that usually restrict the leader, including national mantras about their morality or unmistakability, or favorable beliefs toward the leader from key figures in the polity, or internal struggles and antagonisms within the elite. To achieve securitization, the securitizing actor makes a pronouncement (speech act) describing specific entity, event, or process as an existential threat to societal interests and well-being. If the public accepts such a characterization, securitization is deemed successful, and the securitizing actor obtains exceptional powers to act in circumvention of\n Olga Chislova and Marina Sokolova, \"Cybersecurity in Russia,\" International Cybersecurity Law Review 2, no. 2 (July 2021): 245–51; Mari Ristolainen, \"Should 'RuNet 2020' Be Taken Seriously?

KOLODII\ndemocratic checks and balances.[22] Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).[23]\nST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security.

If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable.[34] The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach.[35] Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes.[36] As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India. Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame. As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment. The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim. As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n Lawrence E.

KOLODII\nwhich is largely unaddressed and unregulated by international law. $^{46}$  Cyberespionage, in this regard, allows nations to eavesdrop on each other, collect valuable intelligence, and steal strategically important information, such as classified documents or trade secrets, all without fear of international retribution. $^{47}$  If victim states refrain from deliberate escalation after exposing foreign digital espionage, the latter might provide potential reassurance as a form of confidence-building measure, leading to greater strategic stability among nations. $^{48}$  Moreover, statistical data suggest that on a 5-point severity scale, where 5 presents maximum severity, the average score for all cyber incidents is 1.62 and for cyber disputes is 1.71, which makes cyberattacks somewhat palatable. $^{49}$  Destructive cyberattacks, in turn, help countries test their cyberweapons in preparation for potential future conflict with a pronounced cyber dimension. Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n##\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nThe Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76]\n[71] \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n[72] \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n[73] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n[74] Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n[75] Ibid.\n[76] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A\nIn none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n^{81}Ibid.\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html\nThis reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors\n\n(e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.\nHypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm. Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness. One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns. However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. This theory posits that a country's attitude toward state-sponsored cybercrime is a\n \"Genprokuratura Podgotovila Mery Po Bor'be S Kiberprestupnost'yu V Rossii\" [The Prosecutor General's Office Has Prepared Measures to Combat Cybercrime in Russia], TASS, July 23, 2020, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9032391.\n TASS, \"Sberbank\"; Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, \"Byudzhet Dlya Grazhdan\" [Budget for the Citizens], 2019, https://minfin.gov.ru/common/upload/library/2019/12/main/Budzhet_dlya_grazhdan_2020-2022.pdf: 5.\n Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n \"Moskva Vysylaet Desyatki Evropeiskikh Diplomatov\" [Moscow Expels Dozens of European Diplomats], BBC, 30 March 2018, https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-43580909; Shaun Walker, \"Russia Arrests Wall Street Journal Reporter and Accuses Him of Espionage,\" The Guardian, March 30, 2023, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich; \"Khronologiya Vvedeniya Sanktsii I Otvetnye Mery Rossii V 2014-2015 Godakh\" [Chronology of Sanctions and Russia's Response in 2014-2015], RIA Novosti, November 25, 2015, https://ria.ru/20151125/1328470681.html.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nresult of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field.[92] However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks  $8^{\\text{th}}$  behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks  $28^{\\text{th}}$  (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is  $48^{\\text{th}}$  (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at  $37^{\\text{th}}$  among 37 economies (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs.[93] Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$ , the United States is  $16^{\\text{th}}$ , top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around  $2\\%$ , while some US allies boast above  $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies).[94] Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall  $46^{\\text{th}}$  among 129 economies (the United States is  $3^{\\text{rd}}$ , top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure\n92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk, \"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\" NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

The country has also scored only 29ᵗʰ in artificial intelligence (AI) government readiness (the United States is 4ᵗʰ, top 8 countries are US allies), having designated only $12.5 million a year on AI research compared to $1.1 billion spent by the United States in 2019 and focusing primarily on AI-related education and military operations rather than its large-scale commercial application that ensured the West's current leadership in this area.\nRussia is also heavily dependent on Western high-tech expertise and technology. Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%). The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon. As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies. Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.\nGiven these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII\noperations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry\n101Massimo Pellegrino, \"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\" European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle, \"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\" Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino, \"The Threat,\" 1.\n^{102}\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\" October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center, \"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\" 2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n^{103}\nRyan Brown, \"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\" CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n^{104}\nJoel Brenner, \"The New Industrial Espionage,\" The American Interest 10, no. 3 (December 2014): 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nransomware attack in 2017. The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion. This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and\n Ellen Nakashima, \"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html; \"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\" The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n Andrew Dawson, \"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\" The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2 (April-June 2019): 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas, \"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\" Social Media + Society 5, no. 3 (August 2019): 11.\n\n375-FZ (2016) that oblige operators and Internet companies to store users' correspondence; Russia's Federal Laws N139-FZ (2012), and N398-FZ (2013) enabling Rozkomnadzor to blacklist and block websites; and the Federal Law N276-FZ (2017) that prevents users from accessing banned content through VPN or proxy services. It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms. With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering\n State Duma of the Russian Federation, \"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\" [How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/; \"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\" BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n Adam Gabbatt, \"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\" The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nharm from foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks—to refrain from public attribution of such attacks and subsequent retaliation.\nHas the invasion of Ukraine in any way impacted Russia's approach to PAC? After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111]\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"\n#\nR. KOLODII\nGeorgia, Poland, Turkey and European Union that could be behind them. $^{112}$  At times, Moscow even refers to Ukraine's IT Army as a hacker group rather than part of the Ukrainian government, possibly in a bid to minimize its role as an element of Ukraine's state agency. $^{113}$  Characteristically, Peskov interpreted attempts to link all foreign cyberattacks against Russia originating on the US territory with the White House as absurd, and Patrushev's deputy Khramov—while acknowledging more than 5,000 foreign cyber-intrusions against Russia since February 2022—straightforwardly called the practice of political attribution of computer attacks unacceptable for Russia. $^{114}$  The Kremlin has thus stopped short of publicly implementing any specific punitive measures against state sponsors of foreign cyberattacks and maintained ambiguity regarding its reporting of foreign cyberattacks post-2022, which largely conforms to its pre-war restraint.\nThese findings, apart from theoretical insight, can also be of value to the practitioner community. The Russia case of PAC, investigated through criminologically-tuned ST, challenges a popular assumption that state-sponsored cyberattacks are necessarily as much of a security issue for all nations as they are intuitively perceived to be, whether in peacetime or wartime. For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nsanctions against respective government and state-affiliated institutions, companies, and individuals, blocking of financial assets and prohibition of transactions, including for third parties, and indictments of foreign government employees, for example, Russian and Chinese military officers implicated in cyberattacks.5 PAC has become an important foreign policy instrument of Western states, but what exactly are its key strategic effects?\nThe extant literature on the politics of PAC, scarce as it is, emphasizes PAC's deterrent function of intimidating state actors and their proxies responsible for cyberattacks, or justifying robust political response against perpetrators through denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos.6 Apart from deterrence, PAC boasts coercive potential for exposing wrongdoers publicly and, where possible, apprehending them, as well as showcasing the country's detection capabilities.7 It also has an expressive function of communicating the rules of the game in cyberspace and roles of the parties involved, which helps shape operational and normative environment of cyberattacks.8 However, the deterrent, coercive, and expressive effects of PAC do not ensue automatically, as what decides the expediency of PAC is first and foremost the incurred damage, financial, physical, or reputational.9 Importantly, deterrence through PAC has its downsides, as states tend to prioritize attribution and punishment for cyberattacks directed against their critical economic or military assets.10 Consequently, such high-value targets receive more investment in cyber-incident prevention and management and are more likely to generate political pressure from the public to retaliate, leaving vulnerabilities of low-value targets under-addressed.11 Also, PAC often foments a sense of urgency to provide more evidence to the public or right away resort to indictments, sanctions, or cyber-actions against perpetrators.12 This all may clash with the interests of decision-makers and dissuade them from PAC, thus emboldening future attacks and public anger at exploitation.13 As a result, for some societies that are particularly averse to risk and uncertainty due to societal,\n\nhistorical, and cultural factors, PAC signals restraint, not as a deterrent but a risk-management strategy to minimize the scale and aftermath of cyberattacks. Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and\nLenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\ndomestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.\n## Securitization Theory and Cyberspace\nSecuritization theory (ST) posits that security is a socially constructed, rather than materially given, phenomenon. Securitization, in this sense, is transferring an issue from the realm of normal politics, which refers to the ordinary routines of day-to-day political management of societal issues, to the area of emergency, which necessitates adoption of exceptional measures to counter an existential threat. These measures require suspension of democratic procedures and formalities that, under normal circumstances, place palpable constraints on the behavior of decision-makers. In nondemocratic regimes, exceptional measures may manifest as the bypassing of some established behavioral rules of the polity that usually restrict the leader, including national mantras about their morality or unmistakability, or favorable beliefs toward the leader from key figures in the polity, or internal struggles and antagonisms within the elite. To achieve securitization, the securitizing actor makes a pronouncement (speech act) describing specific entity, event, or process as an existential threat to societal interests and well-being. If the public accepts such a characterization, securitization is deemed successful, and the securitizing actor obtains exceptional powers to act in circumvention of\n Olga Chislova and Marina Sokolova, \"Cybersecurity in Russia,\" International Cybersecurity Law Review 2, no. 2 (July 2021): 245–51; Mari Ristolainen, \"Should 'RuNet 2020' Be Taken Seriously?

KOLODII\ndemocratic checks and balances.[22] Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).[23]\nST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security. They infringe upon legally protected proprietary and privacy rights of users and cause major economic losses (standing at $8.15 trillion in 2023, which is five times the combined amount of top ten largest military budgets in the world). If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable.[34] The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach.[35] Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes.[36] As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India. Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame. As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment. The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim. As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n Lawrence E.

KOLODII\nwhich is largely unaddressed and unregulated by international law. $^{46}$  Cyberespionage, in this regard, allows nations to eavesdrop on each other, collect valuable intelligence, and steal strategically important information, such as classified documents or trade secrets, all without fear of international retribution. $^{47}$  If victim states refrain from deliberate escalation after exposing foreign digital espionage, the latter might provide potential reassurance as a form of confidence-building measure, leading to greater strategic stability among nations. $^{48}$  Moreover, statistical data suggest that on a 5-point severity scale, where 5 presents maximum severity, the average score for all cyber incidents is 1.62 and for cyber disputes is 1.71, which makes cyberattacks somewhat palatable. $^{49}$  Destructive cyberattacks, in turn, help countries test their cyberweapons in preparation for potential future conflict with a pronounced cyber dimension. Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n##\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nThe Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76]\n[71] \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n[72] \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n[73] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n[74] Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n[75] Ibid.\n[76] TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A\nIn none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n^{81}Ibid.\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html\nThis reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors\n\n(e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.\nHypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm. Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness. One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns. However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC.

KOLODII\nresult of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field.[92] However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks  $8^{\\text{th}}$  behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks  $28^{\\text{th}}$  (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is  $48^{\\text{th}}$  (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at  $37^{\\text{th}}$  among 37 economies (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs.[93] Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$ , the United States is  $16^{\\text{th}}$ , top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around  $2\\%$ , while some US allies boast above  $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies).[94] Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall  $46^{\\text{th}}$  among 129 economies (the United States is  $3^{\\text{rd}}$ , top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure\n92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk, \"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\" NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

The country has also scored only 29ᵗʰ in artificial intelligence (AI) government readiness (the United States is 4ᵗʰ, top 8 countries are US allies), having designated only $12.5 million a year on AI research compared to $1.1 billion spent by the United States in 2019 and focusing primarily on AI-related education and military operations rather than its large-scale commercial application that ensured the West's current leadership in this area.\nRussia is also heavily dependent on Western high-tech expertise and technology. Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%). The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon. As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies. Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.\nGiven these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII\noperations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry\n101Massimo Pellegrino, \"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\" European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle, \"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\" Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino, \"The Threat,\" 1.\n^{102}\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\" October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center, \"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\" 2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n^{103}\nRyan Brown, \"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\" CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n^{104}\nJoel Brenner, \"The New Industrial Espionage,\" The American Interest 10, no. 3 (December 2014): 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nransomware attack in 2017. The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion. This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and\n Ellen Nakashima, \"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html; \"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\" The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n Andrew Dawson, \"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\" The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2 (April-June 2019): 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas, \"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\" Social Media + Society 5, no. 3 (August 2019): 11.\n\n375-FZ (2016) that oblige operators and Internet companies to store users' correspondence; Russia's Federal Laws N139-FZ (2012), and N398-FZ (2013) enabling Rozkomnadzor to blacklist and block websites; and the Federal Law N276-FZ (2017) that prevents users from accessing banned content through VPN or proxy services. It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms. With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering\n State Duma of the Russian Federation, \"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\" [How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/; \"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\" BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n Adam Gabbatt, \"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\" The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nharm from foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks—to refrain from public attribution of such attacks and subsequent retaliation.\nHas the invasion of Ukraine in any way impacted Russia's approach to PAC? After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111]\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"\n#\nR.

The Russia case of PAC, investigated through criminologically-tuned ST, challenges a popular assumption that state-sponsored cyberattacks are necessarily as much of a security issue for all nations as they are intuitively perceived to be, whether in peacetime or wartime. For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for\nRoman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\nPersistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping\n1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n#\nR.

Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and\nLenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies.

KOLODII\ndemocratic checks and balances. Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).\nST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization. Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities. Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military. This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones. In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large. As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security.³⁰ They infringe upon legally protected proprietary and privacy rights of users and cause major economic losses (standing at $8.15 trillion in 2023, which is five times the combined amount of top ten largest military budgets in the world).³¹ If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n²⁹ Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable. The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach. Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far. Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online. Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 (Summer 2012): 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

They also prefer a narrower definition of cybercrime as cyber-enabled crime, with less emphasis on “false information” as a pretext for prosecution.³⁹ Secondly, it is unclear if cyberattacks constitute aggression under international humanitarian law and what response is appropriate.⁴⁰ Since attackers can use proxy servers of a third country to conduct cyber-operations, attributing blame on a specific government may not be reliable yet can result in severe escalation if the right to self-defense is evoked.⁴¹\nIn reality, however, these reasons are of secondary importance. First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India.⁴² Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame.⁴³ As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment.⁴⁴ The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim.⁴⁵ As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n³⁹ Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n⁴⁰ Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n⁴¹ Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n⁴² “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n⁴³ “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n⁴⁴ Lawrence E.

KOLODII\nwhich is largely unaddressed and unregulated by international law. $^{46}$  Cyberespionage, in this regard, allows nations to eavesdrop on each other, collect valuable intelligence, and steal strategically important information, such as classified documents or trade secrets, all without fear of international retribution. $^{47}$  If victim states refrain from deliberate escalation after exposing foreign digital espionage, the latter might provide potential reassurance as a form of confidence-building measure, leading to greater strategic stability among nations. $^{48}$  Moreover, statistical data suggest that on a 5-point severity scale, where 5 presents maximum severity, the average score for all cyber incidents is 1.62 and for cyber disputes is 1.71, which makes cyberattacks somewhat palatable. $^{49}$  Destructive cyberattacks, in turn, help countries test their cyberweapons in preparation for potential future conflict with a pronounced cyber dimension. Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision. Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 (October 2019): 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 (June 2017): 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 (June 2015): 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 (November 2021): 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

It is jointly governed by FSTEK (ΦCTЭК, Federal Service for Technical and Export Control), FSB, and FSB's subagency NKTsKI (HKUKH, National Computer Incident Response and Coordination Center), established in 2017 by the same law that criminalized cyberattacks on CII. Technically, GosSOPKA functions as follows: a CII operator detects a cyberattack and reports it to NKTsKI—if it is connected to its technical infrastructure—or via facsimile, electronic, or telephone communications. In the former case, the operator can contact NKTsKI directly or through one of GosSOPKA's government-affiliated or private centers. If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility. If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind. Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home. The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations. These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public. These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n##\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nThe Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites. On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly. He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution. Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven. According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations. These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.\n \"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\" [The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"\n Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n Ibid.\n TASS, \"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\"; \"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\" [FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html; \"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\" [A\nIn none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea]\nRIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n^{77}“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies]\nRIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies]\nLenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers]\nRIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US]\nRIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia]\nLenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises]\nLenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n^{78}“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded']\nKommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed]\nTASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\n^{79}Kommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\n^{80}Lenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\n^{81}Ibid.\n^{82}“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nKommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n^{83}“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks]\nRIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html\nThis reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint\nThe empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors\n660\nR. KOLODII\n(e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.⁸⁵\nHypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm.⁸⁶ Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness.⁸⁷ One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the \"aggressive\" West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly\n⁸⁵ \"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\" [One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n⁸⁶ \"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\" [Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n⁸⁷ \"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\" [Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953; \"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\" [The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html; \"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\" [Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n661\naccepts its limitations and asks the public for vigilance.⁸⁸ Conversely, embracing Western cyberattacks and eschewing PAC and reprisal may invite further cyber-intrusions and aggravate risks associated with their devastating repercussions. In 2020, for instance, economic losses from cybercrime in Russia made up 3.5 trillion rubles, which surpassed government spending on national defense (3 trillion rubles) or law enforcement and national security (2.4 trillion rubles) for the same calendar year.⁸⁹ The monetary costs of rare PAC outweigh the reputational rewards of projecting victimhood in the cyber domain, which Russia, which reports and laments losses from cybercrime, is aware of.\nHypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate \"Western\" norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns.⁹⁰ However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being \"a Western norm\" rather unlikely.⁹¹\n## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC\nThe aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. This theory posits that a country's attitude toward state-sponsored cybercrime is a\n⁸⁸ \"Genprokuratura Podgotovila Mery Po Bor'be S Kiberprestupnost'yu V Rossii\" [The Prosecutor General's Office Has Prepared Measures to Combat Cybercrime in Russia], TASS, July 23, 2020, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9032391.\n⁸⁹ TASS, \"Sberbank\"; Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, \"Byudzhet Dlya Grazhdan\" [Budget for the Citizens], 2019, https://minfin.gov.ru/common/upload/library/2019/12/main/Budzhet_dlya_grazhdan_2020-2022.pdf: 5.\n⁹⁰ Egorov, \"Chislo.\"\n⁹¹ \"Moskva Vysylaet Desyatki Evropeiskikh Diplomatov\" [Moscow Expels Dozens of European Diplomats], BBC, 30 March 2018, https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-43580909; Shaun Walker, \"Russia Arrests Wall Street Journal Reporter and Accuses Him of Espionage,\" The Guardian, March 30, 2023, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich; \"Khronologiya Vvedeniya Sanktsii I Otvetnye Mery Rossii V 2014-2015 Godakh\" [Chronology of Sanctions and Russia's Response in 2014-2015], RIA Novosti, November 25, 2015, https://ria.ru/20151125/1328470681.html.\n#\nR. KOLODII\nresult of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field. However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks  $8^{\\text{th}}$  behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks  $28^{\\text{th}}$  (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is  $48^{\\text{th}}$  (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at  $37^{\\text{th}}$  among 37 economies (the United States is  $8^{\\text{th}}$ , top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs. Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$ , the United States is  $16^{\\text{th}}$ , top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around  $2\\%$ , while some US allies boast above  $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies). Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall  $46^{\\text{th}}$  among 129 economies (the United States is  $3^{\\text{rd}}$ , top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure\n92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk, \"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\" NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%).⁹⁷ The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon.⁹⁸ As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies.⁹⁹ Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.¹⁰⁰\nGiven these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII\noperations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor. In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages. Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data. Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal. If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry\n101Massimo Pellegrino, \"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\" European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle, \"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\" Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino, \"The Threat,\" 1.\n^{102}\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\" October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center, \"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\" 2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n^{103}\nRyan Brown, \"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\" CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n^{104}\nJoel Brenner, \"The New Industrial Espionage,\" The American Interest 10, no. 3 (December 2014): 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\nransomware attack in 2017.¹⁰⁵ The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged \"cyber-aggression\" on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion.¹⁰⁶ This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and\n¹⁰⁵ Ellen Nakashima, \"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html; \"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\" The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n¹⁰⁶ Andrew Dawson, \"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\" The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2 (April-June 2019): 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas, \"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\" Social Media + Society 5, no. 3 (August 2019): 11.\n666\nR.

It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting \"illegal\" (anti-government) content on their platforms.¹⁰⁷ With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's \"unlawful and undignified\" double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.¹⁰⁸\nIn sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy\nThe securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering\n¹⁰⁷ State Duma of the Russian Federation, \"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\" [How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/; \"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\" BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n¹⁰⁸ Adam Gabbatt, \"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\" The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nharm from foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks—to refrain from public attribution of such attacks and subsequent retaliation.\nHas the invasion of Ukraine in any way impacted Russia's approach to PAC? After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine. However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions. The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.\nThis is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and \"couch hackers\" from Ukraine, the United States,\n109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, \"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\" [Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/; \"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\" [The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e; \"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\" [The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html; \"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\" [FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409; \"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\" [Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\" [Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti, \"V MID zayavili.\"\n#\nR.

The Russia case of PAC, investigated through criminologically-tuned ST, challenges a popular assumption that state-sponsored cyberattacks are necessarily as much of a security issue for all nations as they are intuitively perceived to be, whether in peacetime or wartime. For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective\"naming and shaming\"campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nGone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective\"naming and shaming\"campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for Roman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.\nSecurity Studies Harvard Dataverse Link: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NHG54V Persistent Identifier: doi:10.7910/DVN/NHG54V © 2024 The Author(s).

Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\nIf PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool.\nTraditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC.

Informally branded as\"attribution diplomacy\"under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping 1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann,\"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\"in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia: 1.\n2Ibid., 5.\n3Giles and Hartmann,\"Silent Battle,\"5-6; Christina Wilkie,\"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\"CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury,\"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\"June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410.\n4Christopher Ashley Ford,\"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\"US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold,\"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\"NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20.\n# R. KOLODII sanctions against respective government and state-affiliated institutions, companies, and individuals, blocking of financial assets and prohibition of transactions, including for third parties, and indictments of foreign government employees, for example, Russian and Chinese military officers implicated in cyberattacks.5 PAC has become an important foreign policy instrument of Western states, but what exactly are its key strategic effects?\nThe extant literature on the politics of PAC, scarce as it is, emphasizes PAC's deterrent function of intimidating state actors and their proxies responsible for cyberattacks, or justifying robust political response against perpetrators through denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos.6 Apart from deterrence, PAC boasts coercive potential for exposing wrongdoers publicly and, where possible, apprehending them, as well as showcasing the country's detection capabilities.7 It also has an expressive function of communicating the rules of the game in cyberspace and roles of the parties involved, which helps shape operational and normative environment of cyberattacks.8 However, the deterrent, coercive, and expressive effects of PAC do not ensue automatically, as what decides the expediency of PAC is first and foremost the incurred damage, financial, physical, or reputational.9 Importantly, deterrence through PAC has its downsides, as states tend to prioritize attribution and punishment for cyberattacks directed against their critical economic or military assets.10 Consequently, such high-value targets receive more investment in cyber-incident prevention and management and are more likely to generate political pressure from the public to retaliate, leaving vulnerabilities of low-value targets under-addressed.11 Also, PAC often foments a sense of urgency to provide more evidence to the public or right away resort to indictments, sanctions, or cyber-actions against perpetrators.12 This all may clash with the interests of decision-makers and dissuade them from PAC, thus emboldening future attacks and public anger at exploitation.13 As a result, for some societies that are particularly averse to risk and uncertainty due to societal, historical, and cultural factors, PAC signals restraint, not as a deterrent but a risk-management strategy to minimize the scale and aftermath of cyberattacks. Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits?\nI answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component).\nSubsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and Lenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government.\nLastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC.\nIn sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian UNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE # domestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.¹⁶ ## Securitization Theory and Cyberspace Securitization theory (ST) posits that security is a socially constructed, rather than materially given, phenomenon.¹⁷ Securitization, in this sense, is transferring an issue from the realm of normal politics, which refers to the ordinary routines of day-to-day political management of societal issues, to the area of emergency, which necessitates adoption of exceptional measures to counter an existential threat.¹⁸ These measures require suspension of democratic procedures and formalities that, under normal circumstances, place palpable constraints on the behavior of decision-makers.¹⁹ In nondemocratic regimes, exceptional measures may manifest as the bypassing of some established behavioral rules of the polity that usually restrict the leader, including national mantras about their morality or unmistakability, or favorable beliefs toward the leader from key figures in the polity, or internal struggles and antagonisms within the elite.²⁰ To achieve securitization, the securitizing actor makes a pronouncement (speech act) describing specific entity, event, or process as an existential threat to societal interests and well-being.²¹ If the public accepts such a characterization, securitization is deemed successful, and the securitizing actor obtains exceptional powers to act in circumvention of ¹⁶ Olga Chislova and Marina Sokolova,\"Cybersecurity in Russia,\"International Cybersecurity Law Review 2, no. 2: 245–51; Mari Ristolainen,\"Should 'RuNet 2020' Be Taken Seriously?

KOLODII democratic checks and balances.[22] Alternatively, the actor may also seek to transplant a recognized security issue back into the sphere of ordinary politics for the same purpose of power accretion (de-securitization).[23] ST provides a powerful vocabulary and causality to interrogate how actors construct security threats and invite measures that challenge the existing political status quo. PAC, in this respect, fits within this remit, as it runs counter to the laxity of international law regarding state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. In its present form, however, ST is not readily applicable to the study of PAC. Many countries designate cyberattacks as crimes, although in practice such a legal qualification applies mostly to domestic or foreign nonstate actors, rather than states. In its turn, ST suffers from underdeveloped appreciation of crime and incrimination, obscuring the degree to which criminalization of cyberattacks reflects their securitized status in ST's analytical register.\nIgnoring the nature of crime and incrimination in the cyber domain, securitization scholarship has not yet been able to furnish any conceptualization of PAC and ensuing retributive measures. Instead, it has historically offered only a loosely framed association between crime and securitization.[24] Some sporadic studies tried to question this boundary when examining instances of un(der)securitization of certain criminal activities.[25] Others would critique over-securitization, arguing that crime sometimes should not be securitized but rather dealt with as a criminal matter, meaning being handled by police rather than the military.[26] This encourages a preference for more relaxed and accommodating civilian policy measures over punitive and militarized ones.[27] In the digital domain, however, cyberthreats bypass the level of individual security or crime to focus instead on endangering the network and society at large.[28] As a result of the exclusion of criminal dimensions of digital threats, the literature has favored a macrolevel inspection of the entire cyberspace as a security concern.

The fundamental reason for this is that the two principal varieties of cyberattacks—disruptive cyberattacks that cause data corruption and denial of services and destructive cyberattacks that seize control of critical information infrastructure (CII), for example, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—both gravely jeopardize national security.³⁰ They infringe upon legally protected proprietary and privacy rights of users and cause major economic losses (standing at $8.15 trillion in 2023, which is five times the combined amount of top ten largest military budgets in the world).³¹ If targeting critical infrastructure, they may also lead to kinetic destruction (e.g., the Stuxnet virus from 2010), environmental pollution (e.g., the Maroochy Water Services cyberattack in 2000), disrupted critical services (e.g., the Ukrainian power grid cyberattacks in 2015-2016),\n²⁹ Paul Kallender and Christopher W.

KOLODII\nand—potentially—even nuclear catastrophe. $^{32}$  Given such negative implications, governments across the globe have criminalized cyberattacks on the national level, with 156 countries (80%) having enacted relevant legislation that encompasses, apart from cybercrime, also electronic transactions, consumer protection, and privacy and data protection. $^{33}$\nWhile states conduct joint investigations of cybercrime through liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies or cyber-response teams, they have not elaborated a universally binding legal framework to jointly combat state-sponsored cyberattacks and hold the perpetrator government accountable.[34] The most developed international agreement on cybercrime—Council of Europe's Budapest Convention from 2001—comprises only 68 participating, mostly Western, countries, excluding \"usual suspects\" of cyber-intrusions like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, which substantially narrows its outreach.[35] Notoriously, it criminalizes illegal access, data interference, and system interference carried out \"without right\"—a caveat that permits such actions if authorized by the national government, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes.[36] As a result, the Convention, while indicating nations' resolve for combatting some forms of cybercrime, fails to address state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. Another legal framework—the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace prepared by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Communications Technologies in 2015—is merely a declarative document without binding or retributive clauses, and the UN talks on a universal cybercrime convention have not yielded any binding agreement thus far.[37] Two reasons for this are often proposed. First, states clash over governance powers in cyberspace and a definition of cybercrime. Authoritarian regimes see in strict state oversight over Internet a safeguard for the nation's capacity to exercise sovereignty in a porous and borderless cyber domain. They also stress \"information security\" over cybersecurity in their definition of cybercrime, which could justify state persecution of dissent online.[38] Democratic nations, on the other hand, advocate for a\n32Hannah Lobel, \"Cyber War Inc: The Law of War Implications of the Private Sector's Role in Cyber Conflict,\" Texas International Law Journal 47, no. 2-3 : 626.\n33UNCTAD, \"Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide,\" 14 December 2021, https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide.\n34Samantha Bradshaw, \"Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity,\" Global Commission on Internet Governance, December 2015, https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/gcig_no23web_0.pdf.\n35Council of Europe, \"The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and Its Protocols,\" https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention.\n36Oona A.

First, the difference in political regime does not fully explain why countries willingly sponsor cyberattacks regardless of their political system, be it Russia, China, or the United States and India.⁴² Second, instead of relying solely on the territorial origin of a cyberattack for attribution, competent organizations now try to establish links between cyber criminals and coordinating political institutions of a specific country, and only thereafter ascribe blame.⁴³ As a result, neither difference in regime nor technical difficulty of cyberattack attribution is a sufficient excuse for the delay of the UN’s cybercrime convention. Instead, a criminological perspective can be a better lens to elucidate this paradox. From a functionalist (Durkheimian) standpoint, crime is normal and has the capacity, when adequately restrained, to benefit society. It gives expression to some innovative social change, alerts the government to deficiencies of the social systems, enforces behavioral boundaries within communities, and promotes solidarity through the infliction of punishment.⁴⁴ The visibility of crime may also help reduce the opportunities for criminal behavior by constraining people’s social interactions due to their fear of becoming a victim.⁴⁵ As a result of its functionality, crime at times may be reasonably tolerated and no longer manifest as a threat. In international politics, one of the examples of a tolerated crime is peacetime espionage, in conventional and cyber domains,\nRathi, “Russia.”\n³⁹ Bader, “To Sign or Not to Sign,” 248; Iyengar, Gramer, and Rathi, “Russia.”\n⁴⁰ Hathaway et al., “Law,” 840.\n⁴¹ Duncan Hollis, “A Brief Primer on International Law and Cyberspace,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, June 14, 2021, https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/14/brief-primer-on-international-law-and-cyberspace-pub-84763.\n⁴² “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/.\n⁴³ “An Overview of Russia’s Cyberattack Activity in Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd: 5.\n⁴⁴ Lawrence E.

KOLODII\nwhich is largely unaddressed and unregulated by international law. $^{46}$  Cyberespionage, in this regard, allows nations to eavesdrop on each other, collect valuable intelligence, and steal strategically important information, such as classified documents or trade secrets, all without fear of international retribution. $^{47}$  If victim states refrain from deliberate escalation after exposing foreign digital espionage, the latter might provide potential reassurance as a form of confidence-building measure, leading to greater strategic stability among nations. $^{48}$  Moreover, statistical data suggest that on a 5-point severity scale, where 5 presents maximum severity, the average score for all cyber incidents is 1.62 and for cyber disputes is 1.71, which makes cyberattacks somewhat palatable. $^{49}$  Destructive cyberattacks, in turn, help countries test their cyberweapons in preparation for potential future conflict with a pronounced cyber dimension. Since both disruptive and destructive cyberattacks serve mainly functions of sabotage, espionage, and subversion, they all fall below the threshold of war, which makes them a convenient tool for the states to exercise power without the threat of legal retribution or military escalation from the international community. $^{50}$\nHowever, since countries sponsor cyberattacks and delay international legislation against this practice to preserve their strategic utility, why do they choose to conduct PAC then? Does it not defeat the purpose of maintaining an environment permissive toward cybercrime? From the criminological (labeling) perspective, PAC is a form of incrimination that can be politically meaningful. Labeling someone as a criminal may allow those in position of power (a dominant group) to maintain control over less privileged groups, keeping them marginalized and solidifying their status as dangerous outsiders to be shunned and kept under supervision.[51] Such allocation of blame is further facilitated when the accused actor internalizes the label, which reduces the corrective effects of punishment, increases the likelihood of continued delinquency, and forms a self-feeding vicious loop that perpetuates deviant tendencies and justifies ostracism of\n46Inaki Navarrete and Russell Buchan, \"Out of the Legal Wilderness: Peacetime Espionage, International Law and the Existence of Customary Exceptions,\" Cornell International Law Journal 51, no. 4 : 899.\n47William Banks, \"State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0,\" Texas Law Review 95, no. 7 : 1511; Catherine Lotrione, \"Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law,\" North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 40, no. 2 : 443.\n48Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, and Tim Stevens, \"The Strategic Consequences of Digital Espionage,\" Journal of Cyber Policy 6, no. 3 : 430.\n49Brandon Valeriano and Ryan C.

As a result of PAC, the accused state sponsors of cybercrime sustain reputational damage and might not fully capitalize on their cyber operations abroad due to a heightened anxiety and apprehension of the international community toward them.\nCrime and incrimination, therefore, can be a matter of benefit and functionality under specific circumstances rather than an imminent necessity, including in the cyber domain. Such an interpretation helps translate cybercrime into securitization categories and mitigate the theory's weaknesses. In this regard, normal politics in cyberspace is, therefore, relative political tolerance to state-sponsored cyber-intrusions when the government does not sensationalize them to preserve for itself an equivalent \"right\" to conduct cyber operations without much retribution from international law. Exceptional measures, conversely, take place when the government, democratic or autocratic, no longer limits its response to routine police hunts of individual or collective hackers. Instead, it uses sanctions, indictments of foreign state operatives, and public naming and shaming campaigns against another government, including through international ad-hoc coalitions of the willing, thus breaking with a relatively tolerant, low-profile management of cyber espionage. This also undermines the custom of keeping the boundaries between hackers and their alleged state sponsors blurry to avoid interstate escalation. Finally, PAC itself is a speech act that labels foreign governments as perpetrators and prescribes retaliation.\nIn its generalized version, the securitization theory of PAC, therefore, posits that PAC is an instrument that the states use to undermine the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retain superiority in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to wield it hinges on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime\n52Emily Restivo and Mark M.

If a CII facility belongs to the financial sector, its owner is also obligated to report the incident to Russia's Central Bank. Over time, NKTsKI aggregates data on cyber incidents directly or through GosSOPKA centers and disseminates them amongst GosSOPKA members to canvass and implement cyber-response. If a similar attack has already happened once, GosSOPKA centers deploy previously devised playbooks containing measures to locate it and mitigate its consequences for a given CII facility.[57] If it has no precedent, a working group involving experts from the CII facility comes together to design a solution. Once implemented, this solution forms a new playbook shared among GosSOPKA stakeholders to counter future cyberattacks of a similar kind.[58] Such a public-private partnership model enables private cybersecurity companies to feed their cyber threat\n54\"Sozdanie Gosystemy Obnaruzheniya, Preduprezhdeniya i Likvidatsii Posledstvi Komp'yuternykh Atak na Informatsionnye Resursy RF\" [On the Establishment of the State System for Detecting, Preventing and Eliminating the Consequences of Computer Attacks on Information Resources of the Russian Federation], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, January 17, 2013, https://rg.ru/documents/2013/01/18/komp-ataki-site-dok..\n55\"White Paper o Monitoringe Informatsionnoi Bezopasnosti i Podklyuchenii k GosSOPKA\" [White Paper on Monitoring Information Security and Connecting to Gossopka], Perspektivnyi Monitoring, https://amonitoring.ru/service/White%20Paper%202019.pdf: 5; \"Natsional'nyi Koordinatsionnyi Tsentr Po Komp'yuternym Intsidentam NKTSKI\" [National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents NKTSKI], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Компания:Национальный координационный центр по компьютерным инцидентам (HKUKH).\n56\"Bezopasnost' Kriticheskoi Informatsionnoi Infrastruktury RF\" [The Security of the Critical Information Infrastructure of the Russian Federation], Tadviser, https://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/Статьи:Безопасность_критической_информационной_инфраструктуры_РФ.\n57Dmitrii Kuznetsov, \"GosSOPKA: Chto Tako, Zachem Nuzhna I Kak Ustroena\" [GosSOPKA: What Is It, Why Is It Needed and How Does It Work], Anti-Malware, 2 April 2019, https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Technology_Analysis/gossopka-what-is-it-how-it-works.\n58Ibid.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE\n#\nperceptions and knowledge into GosSOPKA, thus bolstering their status as securitizing actors.\nImportantly, GosSOPKA is only partially fenced off from the international community. NKTsKI has cooperated with cyber CERTs (computer emergency response teams) from 153 foreign countries, allowing it—as of 2020—to eliminate 69,000 cyber threats abroad and 9000 cyber threats at home.[59] The company Jet Infosystems, a GosSOPKA center since 2020, has been a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which stipulates information exchange on cyberattacks, technical vulnerabilities, and malware threats with foreign cybersecurity organizations.[60] These ties, however, breed their own risks for Russia, as by the Kremlin's own admission, Russian companies ignore FSB decrees that permit release of such sensitive cybersecurity data to foreign actors only through FSTEK's approval. To enforce this rule, the government prohibited the processing of data on Russian CII abroad.[61]\nThis tendency toward more insulation and less transparency is also reflected in the lack of institutional instruments for public disclosure of cyber events. The official documents governing or related to GosSOPKA, for example, the presidential decree N31c, the federal laws 187-FZ and 149-FZ, as well as Russia's national doctrine of information security effective since 2016, do not acknowledge the Russian public as a stakeholder to the system. The mentions of \"informing\" and \"notification,\" such as those used in FSB's decrees N367 and N368 regulating information-sharing within GosSOPKA, all refer to institutional entities that conduct end-to-end exchange of technical data, making the system sealed off from the general public.[62] These documents do not prescribe any guidelines on how cyber threat-related information should be communicated to the Russian society as a consumer and recipient of cybersecurity policies, leaving the design and implementation of PAC to the circumstantial discretion of decision-makers.\nIn summary, Russia's national cyber-incident response system, based on its organizational and legal design, does not facilitate PAC. While it co-opts private cybersecurity actors into technical attribution efforts and exhibits semi-openness, deliberately or unwittingly, to information exchanges with government and private actors from abroad, it still takes great care in keeping such information out of the public eye.

KOLODII\nexamine this tendency further through a large dataset of media reports regarding Russia's cyber-incident reporting over the decades.\n# Public Attribution of Cyberattacks in Russia: Longitudinal Media Analysis\nFor the purpose of this research, the empirical data on Russia's PAC come from thousands of reports in the online archives of four major Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and Lenta.ru., from early 2000s (depending on archive availability—1999 for Lenta.ru, 2003 for Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2007 for RIA Novosti, and 2013 for TASS) through January 2022 (before Russia's invasion of Ukraine). These reports were obtained using a query term combining the Russian words \"Россия\" (Russia) (to isolate cybersecurity events related only to Russia) and \"хакер\" (hacker). The latter is twice as frequent as the prefix \"cyber\" in Google Ngram Viewer analysis of online Russian-language sources (0.0000705645 vs. 0.0000319193% in 2019), yielding more search results. Based on the data from Table 1, the number of cases where foreign governments are suspected of staging cyberattacks against Russia makes up an infinitesimal portion of the selected cyberattack-related coverage— $0.2\\%$  for TASS,  $1.4\\%$  for Lenta.ru,  $0.5\\%$  for RIA Novosti, and  $0.3\\%$  for Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Instead, most reports overwhelmingly focus on the attribution of cyberattacks to foreign territories and nationals, making PAC against foreign governments a relatively rare practice in Russia. The instances where the Kremlin attributed cyberattacks to foreign governments—for all sampled media outlets—mostly outnumber those where the securitizing actor was a nongovernment entity (see Table 1, the \"Attributor: government/nongovernment\" columns). Often, such reports are not public attribution per se, but rather an official commentary regarding cyber threats from abroad. These include: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that the lack of the US administration's response to the news reports about US military hackers infiltrating Russian telecommunications and electricity grids amounts to state-sanctioned cyberterrorism; President Spokesman\nTable 1.

Even during the 2016 financial cyberattacks, while claiming involvement of foreign intelligence agencies, the Kremlin stopped short of accusing Kyiv and instead directed public attention toward BlazingFast. Furthermore, none of these reports proposed any retaliatory action. In those rare cases when Russia admitted the need for response, it would mainly advocate for more protective measures to achieve digital self-sustainability and sovereignty. Even then, however, these initiatives were announced not as retribution for cyberattacks, but, according to Russia's Security Council, as a response to the United States' own growing cyber capabilities.\nAs for the form of speech act, the vast majority of reports betray a nonsensationalist, somewhat lethargic tonality. The closest their interpretation of cyberattacks resembled ST's canonical requirement of existential threat was the Security Council's statement that cyberattacks against the country present a “colossal danger.” However, even then they were not attributed to any government. When they were, like in FSB's investigation of the 2016 cyberattacks on Russian banking sector, they were portrayed as attempting to destabilize Russia's financial and credit system or, according to Sberbank, being a thousand times more powerful than all previous cyberattacks. Although such phrasings capture the impact and scope of the attacks, they are sporadic and inconsistent across a wider sample of state-led cyber-threat reporting. This inconsistency limits their capacity to stir the agitation needed for stronger popular support for securitization.\n## UNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE The Kremlin also did not mount public naming and shaming campaigns against state sponsors of cyberattacks, either independently or in concert with other states. Peskov, for instance, while conceding that Russian digital systems face recurring cyberattacks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, remarked that they have nothing to do with foreign governments, while simultaneously alluding that foreign security agencies are behind some very aggressive attacks on Russian banks and government websites.[71] On another occasion, he also indicated that although cyberattacks against Russia can be often traced back to Europe, the United States, Canada, China, and India, accusing these governments would be unsound and even silly.[72] He further underscored that Russia does not seek to resemble those who resort to unsound and unjustified accusations when it comes to cyberattack attribution.[73] Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council Khramov, in his turn, even referred to collective attribution as tantamount to a Stalinist practice of objective accusation, when a person is found guilty in criminal court without their fault being proven.[74] According to him, since it is exceedingly difficult to attribute cyberattacks reliably, naming and shaming campaigns that the Five Eyes countries lead are tainted by political context and designed to justify retaliatory measures, namely informational, conventional, and even nuclear warfare against inconvenient nations.[75] These official utterances attest to Moscow's firm intention to distance itself from the practice of individual and collective PAC.\nRussia's phlegmatic approach in this area is even more pronounced with its foreign authoritarian partners. For instance, there have been only a handful of reports attributing cyberattacks to the Chinese government, with the majority mentioning China only as their place of origin or their Chinese-language traces. Most importantly, the Kremlin did not extensively engage in public attribution of Chinese cyberattacks. Only in three cases did the government officials indicate China as a source of cyberattacks, namely in Peskov's commentary, in the report by Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service about DDoS attacks on its website, and in the statement of the Russian-controlled Crimean Ministry for Interior Policies, Information, and Communication about cyberattacks on Crimean government agencies.[76] [71]\"V Kremle Zayavili O Tysyachakh Kiberatak Zapada Na Rossiyu\"[The Kremlin Informed About Thousands of Western Cyberattacks on Russia], Lenta.ru, January 20, 2017, https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/20/tysachy_kiberatak_peskov/.\n[72]\"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh Na Rossiiskie Informatsionnye Sistemy [Peskov Informed About Cyberattacks on Russian Information Systems], TASS, January 16, 2017, https://tass.ru/politika/3943779.\n[73] TASS,\"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh.\"[74] Egorov,\"Chislo.\"[75] Ibid.\n[76] TASS,\"Peskov Rasskazal O Kiberatakakh\";\"FSIN Zayavila O Massirovannykh DDoS-Atakakh Iz-Za Rubezha\"[FSIN Reported Massive DDoS Attacks from Abroad], RIA Novosti, January 18, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210118/fsin-1593571233.html;\"V Krymu Otrazili Massirovannuyu Khakerskuyu Ataku Na Gosportaly Regiona\"[A In none of these cases did the Russian government blame Beijing for orchestrating the attacks, only private cyber threat reporting firms accomplished that (e.g. Positive Technologies, Group-IB, Orange Business Services, FireEye Inc, Sentinel Labs, and Symantec). The Kremlin instead reacted with either indifference or dismissal. NKTsKI, for instance, ignored the evidence that the American cybersecurity firm Cybereason presented about the 2021 Chinese cyberattacks against Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering—one of the three major manufacturers of submarines for the Russian Navy. Rubin and another Russian manufacturing company Hidropribor—a weapon supplier to the Russian Navy and also a victim of Beijing-sponsored hackers—both declined to comment on the incidents. On another occasion, Rostelekom-Solar, a major Russian state-owned cybersecurity company, officially refused to react to an investigation by Sentinel Labs that implicated the Chinese state-sponsored cyber-group TA428 in the 2021 cyberattacks on Russian government websites. This is even despite Rostelekom-Solar's prior admission in its own joint investigation with NKTsKI that those cyber-mercenaries indeed represented interests of a foreign state. In the same spirit, Moscow also belittled the impact of cyberattacks from North Korea. In January 2022, the North Korean cyber group Konni unleashed a phishing attack on Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which successfully compromised an account of one of the officials and sent out messages with harmful attachments. The Ministry, however, refused to contact the North Korean government regarding the incident.\nMassive Cyberattack on the Regional State Portals Was Repelled in Crimea] RIA Novosti, August 14, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190814/1557504386.html.\n“Eksperty Obnaruzhili Gruppu Khakerov Iz Azii, Atakovavshikh Rossiiskie Kompanii” [Experts Discovered A Group of Hackers from Asia Who Attacked Russian Companies] RIA Novosti, May 13, 2019, https://ria.ru/20190513/1553441446.html; “Kitai Prosponsiroval Ataki Khakerov Na Rossiiskie Gosorgany” [China Sponsored Hacker Attacks Against Russian Government Agencies] Lenta.ru, August 6, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/08/06/chinese/; “Eksperty Predupredili Banki Ob Uchastivshikhsya Masshtabnykh Atakakh Khakerov” [Experts Warn Banks of Increased Large-Scale Attacks by Hackers] RIA Novosti, September 13, 2021, https://ria.ru/20210913/khakery-1749858570.html; “Doklad: Cel'iu Khakerov Iz Kitaya Vse Chashche Stanovitsya Rossiya, A Ne SSHA” [Report: Chinese Hackers Are Increasingly Targeting Russia, Not the US] RIA Novosti, June 21, 2016, https://ria.ru/20160621/1449396259.html; “Eksperty Iz SSHA Obvinili ‘Grozovykh Koshek' V Khakerskikh Atakakh Na Rossiyu” [US Experts Accused Thundercats of Hacking Russia] Lenta.ru, June 11, 2021, https://lenta.ru/news/2021/06/11/hakerkitty/; “Khakery Atakovali 48 Khimicheskikh I Oboronnykh Predpriyatii” [Hackers Attacked 48 Chemical and Defense Enterprises] Lenta.ru, November 1, 2011, https://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/01/attack/.\n“Rubin' Berut Na Abordazh” [Rubin Is Being ‘Boarded'] Kommersant, May 7, 2021, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4802201; “Ekspert: Dannye Ob Atake Kitaiskikh Khakerov Na TSKB ‘Rubin' Ne Podtverzhdayutsya” [Expert: Data on Chinese Hackers' Attack on TSKB Rubin Not Confirmed] TASS, May 18, 2021, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11399865.\nKommersant, “‘Rubin'.”\nLenta.ru, “Eksperty iz SSHA.”\nIbid.\n“V MID Prishli Troyanskie Konni” [Trojan Konni Came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs] Kommersant, January 17, 2022, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5171556.\n“Rossiya Ne Obrashchalas K KNDR Po Povodu Dannykh O Khakerskikh Atakakh” [Russia Did Not Contact North Korea Regarding Hacker Attacks] RIA Novosti, January 19, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220119/khakery-1768517363.html This reveals a consistent tendency by the Russian government to refrain from PAC against foreign governments. On the extremely rare occasions of such attribution, Moscow did not depict the cyberattacks as existential threats, withheld details, obfuscated the alleged culprit, and remained reticent on retributive actions. Russia's cyber-incident response, therefore, has remained largely within the scope of normal politics.\n## Addressing Possible Explanations of Russia's Restraint The empirical material from the last two sections allows us to test the five previously proposed hypotheses on why Russia has not reproduced the Western-style PAC against foreign governments, both in terms of the institutional design of its national cyber-response system and dominant state media discourse.\nHypothesis 1. The Russian government and private actors might lack sufficient technical capabilities for cyberattack attribution.\nThis argument is weak. The Kremlin has committed significant institutional and organizational resources to cyberattack attribution through GosSOPKA, bolstered by Russian cybersecurity firms, as well as military (FSTEK) and security (FSB) institutions. These highly privileged organizations have priority access to Russian state resources, scientific expertise or financial instruments. In 2018, for instance, when PAC became widely embraced in the West, Russia's combined budget spending on military, law enforcement, and security agencies already comprised around 5 trillion rubles for 2019, surpassing all other government expenditures. These institutions, therefore, can afford technical attribution of cyberattacks. Also, private cybersecurity firms have demonstrated their ability to conduct PAC reliably and share their findings with the Russian government. This way, the Kremlin has guaranteed access to information about state-sponsored cyberattacks, but still maintains relative silence.\nHypothesis 2. Russian firms might not conduct PAC to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin by acting too independently, as doing so could cause them legal or economic troubles.\nThis explanation is rather unlikely. It is precisely private cybersecurity firms that provide the most unapologetic evidence of foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks on Russia. Unlike the Kremlin, these firms do not allude to foreign states being behind some of the attacks but refer to their governments by name. Most importantly, publicizing such information does not cause trouble to such firms, with some of the most outspoken attributors (e.g., Kaspersky Lab) successfully maintaining rapport with the Kremlin despite the disclosures.⁸⁵ Hypothesis 3. Russia does not want to demonstrate its vulnerability (or technological inferiority to the West) through PAC to preclude a negative domestic response.\nThis is not a compelling hypothesis. First, Putin already referred to the United States as the only superpower, which implies Russia's concession of the United States' discernible superiority, including in the technological realm.⁸⁶ Then, the Russian state media and government officials report on the extensive adverse economic impact of cybercrime in Russia, including that originating abroad, which is already enough to expose weakness.⁸⁷ One can argue, however, that Russia projects strength by abstaining from disclosures of successful cyberattacks by foreign states, rather than anonymous criminals. Success implies certain damage, or privation, effectuated by the attack. Indeed, many reports inform how Russia uncovered or even repelled foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks. However, it does not mean they were unsuccessful. Halted DDoS attacks may still leave behind operational damage to the affected networks, while uncovered malware might have already transferred plenty of local data back to its remote controllers before being unplanted. The state-owned outlets do share private investigations proving links between specific foreign governments and cyberattacks on Russian targets which can be deemed successful, in this sense. Such reports in the state-owned press suggest that the Kremlin does not fear backlash from the public regarding Russia's perceived vulnerability and thus abstains from censoring them.\nHypothesis 4. Russia shuns PAC because instead of deterring foreign cyberattacks through PAC, embracing them and being their target can help it showcase defensive cyber measures or claim victimhood regarding the\"aggressive\"West.\nThis explanation is unlikely due to an imbalanced cost-reward ratio. Cybercrime-induced damage is, by default, a result of poor cyber-defense. Since Russia routinely and casually reports on huge losses related to cybercrime, it does not tend to boast its defensive measures but instead publicly ⁸⁵\"Eshche Odin Predstavitel' IT-Industrii Voshel v Ekspertnyi Sovet pri Pravitel'stve RF\"[One More Representative of the IT Industry Joined the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation], D-russia.ru, December 13, 2022, https://d-russia.ru/eshhjo-odin-predstavitel-it-industrii-voshjol-v-jekspertnij-sovet-pri-pravitelstve-rf.html.\n⁸⁶\"Putin Nazval SSHA Edinstvennoi Sverkhderzhavoi\"[Putin Called the US the Only Superpower], Lenta.ru, June 17, 2016, https://lenta.ru/news/2016/06/17/obamathegreat/.\n⁸⁷\"Sberbank Podschital Poteri Rossiiskoi Ekonomiki V 2021 Godu Ot Kiberprestupnosti\"[Sberbank Has Calculated the Losses of the Russian Economy from Cybercrime in 2021], TASS, June 18, 2020, https://tass.ru/ekonomika/8761953;\"Ekspert Otsenil Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii V Rossii V 2021 Godu\"[The Expert Assessed the Damage from Cybercrime in Russia in 2021], RIA Novosti, December 22, 2021, https://ria.ru/20211222/kiberprestupleniya-1764832102.html;\"MVD: Ushcherb Ot Kiberprestuplenii Prevysil 10 Milliardov Rublei\"[Ministry of Internal Affairs: Damage from Cybercrimes Exceeded 10 Billion Rubles], Rossiyskaya Gazeta, December 10, 2019, https://rg.ru/2019/12/10/mvd-ushcherb-ot-kiberprestuplenijprevysil-10-milliardov-rublej.html.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE Hypothesis 5. Russia does not conduct PAC because this would validate\"Western\"norms.\nThis is not a convincing argument. Indeed, Russia's Security Council condemned the Western practice of collective naming and shaming in the cyber domain, declaring that it does not want to mimic the countries that partake in such campaigns.⁹⁰ However, according to the same statement, the aversion to PAC stems from the difficulty to attribute cyberattacks reliably, which means that Russia justifies its rejection of the Western PAC not for normative but technical reasons. Additionally, if the Kremlin construed PAC as the Western norm to avoid, it most likely would not allow state-owned media to disseminate PAC reports of private firms, thus giving tacit endorsement to the practice. Finally, Russia has a strong record of mirroring—hence validating—Western punitive measures in hybrid confrontations, be it expulsion of diplomats, detainment of alleged spies, or imposition of sanctions, making the rejection of PAC solely on the ground of its being\"a Western norm\"rather unlikely.⁹¹ ## The Main Reason behind Russia's Aversion to PAC The aforementioned five hypotheses fail to fully and conclusively explain Russia's aversion to PAC against foreign states. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. This theory posits that a country's attitude toward state-sponsored cybercrime is a ⁸⁸\"Genprokuratura Podgotovila Mery Po Bor'be S Kiberprestupnost'yu V Rossii\"[The Prosecutor General's Office Has Prepared Measures to Combat Cybercrime in Russia], TASS, July 23, 2020, https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9032391.\n⁸⁹ TASS,\"Sberbank\"; Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation,\"Byudzhet Dlya Grazhdan\"[Budget for the Citizens], 2019, https://minfin.gov.ru/common/upload/library/2019/12/main/Budzhet_dlya_grazhdan_2020-2022.pdf: 5.\n⁹⁰ Egorov,\"Chislo.\"⁹¹\"Moskva Vysylaet Desyatki Evropeiskikh Diplomatov\"[Moscow Expels Dozens of European Diplomats], BBC, 30 March 2018, https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-43580909; Shaun Walker,\"Russia Arrests Wall Street Journal Reporter and Accuses Him of Espionage,\"The Guardian, March 30, 2023, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich;\"Khronologiya Vvedeniya Sanktsii I Otvetnye Mery Rossii V 2014-2015 Godakh\"[Chronology of Sanctions and Russia's Response in 2014-2015], RIA Novosti, November 25, 2015, https://ria.ru/20151125/1328470681.html.\n# R. KOLODII result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. If PAC does not take place, it entails that the country favors political impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks because such tolerance, despite collateral harm, brings strategic benefits. To validate this explanation, it is essential to establish if the theory's premise of double asymmetry applies in Russia's case.\nFirst and foremost, there is a distinct imbalance between the West and Russia in their capacity to harness and deploy cyber technologies. With its pioneering use of cyberspace-enabled hybrid warfare, as well as offensive and defensive cyber operations, Russia is considered one of the preeminent powers in this field.[92] However, it lags behind the West across a number of critical globally recognized metrics in the cyber domain. Russia's global cybersecurity ranks $8^{\\text{th}}$ behind the United States and its five allies, its national cyber-defense ranks $28^{\\text{th}}$ (top 10 countries are US allies), its networked readiness is $48^{\\text{th}}$ (the United States is $8^{\\text{th}}$, the top 8 countries are US allies), and its global competitiveness stands at $37^{\\text{th}}$ among 37 economies (the United States is $8^{\\text{th}}$, top 10 countries are US allies), with especially meager progress in upgrading and broadening access to electricity and ICTs.[93] Moreover, Russia underperforms in ICT development ( $45^{\\text{th}}$, the United States is $16^{\\text{th}}$, top 7 countries are US allies) and the proportion of the population with advanced digital skills (around $2\\%$, while some US allies boast above $10\\%$ ), especially in such areas as business, data science, and technology (many top 10 countries—US allies).[94] Also, Russia's capacity for innovation remains underwhelming, scoring overall $46^{\\text{th}}$ among 129 economies (the United States is $3^{\\text{rd}}$, top 8 countries are US allies) and markedly failing in human capital, research, business and market sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, as well as infrastructure 92Janne Hakala and Jazlyn Melnychuk,\"Russia's Strategy in Cyberspace,\"NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, June 2021, https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_11-06-2021-4f4ce.pdf; Andrew S.

Advanced semiconductors are produced mainly by TSMC (Taiwan, 54% of the global market), Samsung (South Korea, 17%), Global Foundries (the US, 7%), and UMC (Taiwan, 7%).⁹⁷ The photolithographic equipment used by the world's largest chip producers—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—is also manufactured by US allies, namely Dutch company ASML (62% of global market), and Japanese companies Canon and Nikon.⁹⁸ As a result, Russia has to rely on the West for supplies of the main building block of high-tech solutions—chips. Russian Main Directorate for Traffic Safety, as well as multiple other state agencies, for instance, use domestically manufactured Elbrus servers and Baikal processors, which were also widely advertised on Russia's Army 2021 Expo, suggesting potential for their integration within the military agencies.⁹⁹ Both technologies, however, while taunted as reliable barriers against foreign cyberattacks on Russian CII, have been built on TSMC-manufactured chips, betraying the vital role of Western technology in Russia's strategy for achieving digital sovereignty.¹⁰⁰ Given these diverse layers of technological asymmetry with the West, Russia—a weaker actor—benefits from the normalcy of state-sponsored cyber-intrusions in three ways.

KOLODII operations to steal Western technology and reverse-engineer it at home, gradually leveling out its staggering disparity with the West. The Kremlin-affiliated hacker group Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly), for instance, has been stealing the intellectual property of American, European, and Asian energy and technology firms, the kind of industrial espionage that helps the Kremlin to tip the competitive balance in its favor.[101] In the past, Russia attempted to obtain thousands of computer files on car engine and component designs of South Korea's GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology in 2009 and access Germany's helicopter technology using anonymous e-mail addresses in 2008; it also collected intellectual property data from US energy, healthcare, and technology companies, unlawfully gathered emails of US and European employees of transportation and financial services firms for economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and used state-sponsored cyber-program APT28 to obtain sensitive US defense industry data that could give Moscow economic and security advantages.[102] Moscow has also been using computer-network exploitation and e-mail interception to save billions of dollars on R&amp;D in the energy, information technology, telecommunications, aerospace, and security sectors, as well as stealing medical technologies, such as COVID-19 vaccine research data.[103] Conversely, given its relative weakness in commercializing technology, Russia itself does not have much intellectual property to steal.[104] If the West mirrors Moscow's cyber-intrusions, it would access technologies that are substantially inferior to its own, which may not warrant the costs of conducting such intrusive cyberespionage in the first place.\nSecondly, impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks helps Russia test and improve its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. On the offensive side, Russia can test the design of its disruptive and destructive cyber operations and upgrade them accordingly. For instance, before unleashing the NotPetya virus on Ukraine in 2017, Russian GRU had built upon earlier versions of the Petya malware disseminated in 2016 and Microsoft Windows' vulnerability EternalBlue previously exploited in the WannaCry 101Massimo Pellegrino,\"The Threat of State-Sponsored Industrial Espionage,\"European Union Institute for Security Studies, June 2015, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_26_Industrial_espionage.pdf; Jim Finkle,\"Russia Hacked Hundreds of Western, Asian Companies: Security Firm,\"Reuters, January 22, 2014, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyberespionage-idUSBREA0L07Q20140122; Pellegrino,\"The Threat,\"1.\n\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive,\"Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace: Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2009-2011,\"October 2011, https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/Foreign_Economic_Collection_2011.pdf; National Counterintelligence and Security Center,\"Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,\"2018, https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/feec-2018.pdf: 8-9).\n\nRyan Brown,\"Russia Is Trying to Hack And Steal Coronavirus Vaccine Data, US, Canadian and UK Officials Claim,\"CNBC, July 16, 2020, https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-uk-and-canada-say-russia-trying-to-steal-coronavirus-vaccine-data.\n\nJoel Brenner,\"The New Industrial Espionage,\"The American Interest 10, no. 3: 8.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE ransomware attack in 2017.¹⁰⁵ The NotPetya case has thus demonstrated Russia's ability to redesign existing cyber viruses to launch new cyberattacks. At the same time, based on state media reporting on PAC, Russia seems unbothered by the possibility of Western cyberattacks in return, as they have yet to exhibit sufficiently destructive potential toward Russia compared to the Russian cyber operations against the West. Besides, any devastating Western cyberattack on Russia, once made public, might cause political uproar and backlash in the West and global South at an alleged\"cyber-aggression\"on the part of liberal democracies and deal a major reputational blow, which might have nurtured the West's caution thus far. Conversely, executed by the well-known recidivist, Russia's cyberattacks are not surprising, which removes the same political and reputational risks for the Kremlin. On the defensive side, Russia can use Western cyberattacks, which have been path-dependent and limited in damage inflicted, to further improve GosSOPKA. This system is grounded in a learning feedback mechanism when cyber-intrusions and their solutions pile up as playbooks to better standardize and operationalize cyber-incident response in the country, which may also incentivize Moscow to ossify the normalcy of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\nLastly, Moscow's cyber operations can exacerbate political crises in its key global rivals—liberal democracies. The latter must maintain a sufficient degree of openness, diversity, inclusion, and nondiscrimination in their domestic technological and political markets to thrive. Russia has been exploiting this democratic mechanism profusely by leveraging cyberspace to meddle in foreign elections, spreading disinformation and fake news through bot farms and troll factories on social media, and manipulating public opinion.¹⁰⁶ This helped Moscow promote pro-Russian politicians to the position of power or enhance social divide and popular mistrust in government so that these countries become absorbed by domestic issues instead of countering Russia's expansionism and assassination campaigns abroad. Conversely, as an autocracy, Russia does not face democratic tradeoffs of transparency and openness versus increased vulnerability. It has built extensive repressive tools to control local cyberspace, such as FSB's use of System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to intercept and monitor Internet and phone services; Yarovaya laws' 374-FZ and ¹⁰⁵ Ellen Nakashima,\"Russian Military Was Behind 'NotPetya' Cyberattack in Ukraine, CIA Concludes,\"The Washington Post, January 12, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html;\"NotPetya and WannaCry Call for a Joint Response from International Community,\"The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/news/2017/notpetya-and-wannacry-call-for-a-joint-response-from-international-community/.\n¹⁰⁶ Andrew Dawson,\"How Russia's Internet Research Agency Built Its Disinformation Campaign,\"The Political Quarterly 90, no. 2: 245–56; Marco Bastos and Johan Farkas,\"Donald Trump Is My President\": The Internet Research Agency Propaganda Machine,\"Social Media + Society 5, no. 3: 11.\n\n375-FZ (2016) that oblige operators and Internet companies to store users' correspondence; Russia's Federal Laws N139-FZ (2012), and N398-FZ (2013) enabling Rozkomnadzor to blacklist and block websites; and the Federal Law N276-FZ (2017) that prevents users from accessing banned content through VPN or proxy services. It has also restricted business activities of foreign tech giants on Russian soil through the data localization law and fines for not deleting\"illegal\"(anti-government) content on their platforms.¹⁰⁷ With such mechanisms in place, Russia's capacity to withstand foreign information and psychological operations is superior to that of the West. Tolerating state-sponsored cybercrime globally means that Russia could continue its information-psychological warfare, while analogous actions of the Western nations against Russia would either stumble upon its fortified information infrastructure rendering them hardly effective, or be met with domestic protests against the West's\"unlawful and undignified\"double-standards, echoing the protests against the US mass cyber-surveillance program that engulfed many Western countries following the 2013 Snowden revelations.¹⁰⁸ In sum, given its technological inferiority to the West, Russia's ability to use cyberattacks to steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert Western democracies overall outweigh, in Moscow's calculus, the harm it suffers from cyberattacks from abroad. Consequently, the Kremlin dodges the practice of PAC and punitive response in favor of a more tolerant attitude toward state-sponsored cyber-intrusions.\n## Implications for Research and Policy The securitization theory of PAC, which draws on criminology, provides an improved way of discussing the social construction of cybersecurity. It demonstrates that political response to state-sponsored cybercrime is a result of double asymmetry: difference in power between the accuser and the accused, and difference in strategic utility of tolerated crime vis-à-vis internationally prosecuted crime. This double asymmetry applies to Russia: it is inferior to the West in terms of cyber-power, and it also profits from internationally tolerated cybercrime more than the West. The theory argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet benefits from cyber-intrusions technically and politically might choose—despite suffering ¹⁰⁷ State Duma of the Russian Federation,\"Kak Budet Rabotat' Zakon o 'Prizemlenii' IT-Gigantov\"[How the Law on the Localization of IT Giants Will Work], January 14, 2022, http://duma.gov.ru/news/53199/;\"Russia Fines Google over Illegal Content Breach,\"BBC, December 24, 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59784118.\n¹⁰⁸ Adam Gabbatt,\"Protesters Rally for 'The Day We Fight Back' Against Mass Surveillance,\"The Guardian, February 11, 2014, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/day-fight-back-protest-nsa-mass-surveillance.\nUNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE # harm from foreign state-sponsored cyberattacks—to refrain from public attribution of such attacks and subsequent retaliation.\nHas the invasion of Ukraine in any way impacted Russia's approach to PAC? After the land incursion into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia launched massive disruptive and destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian CII, provoking Kyiv's retaliation. In this light, on a couple of occasions, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, and Security Council did resort to PAC, accusing US government institutions, NATO agencies, and even Microsoft of targeting Russian CII at the hands of Ukraine.[109] However, none of these reports pertain to specific instances of cyberattacks, concentrating instead on the general trend; also, none contain sufficient forensic analysis and, most importantly, detailed retributive measures. Instead, FSB vaguely promised to identify the perpetrators—ironically, despite having identified them already in the report itself—and bring them to justice; Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to increase legal protections for Russian entities against cybercrime and promote respective measures through the UN; and Patrushev called for further internationalization of Internet governance to prevent Western cyber-intrusions.[110] The lack of credible punishment for cyberattacks and the recurrent theme in most of these reports of Ukraine's IT Army being merely an instrument of the Western cyber-aggression against Russia indicate that the purpose of Russia's PAC has been not so much deterrence or reprisal. Instead, it was rhetorical support for the Kremlin's strategic narrative about Ukraine's alleged loss of sovereignty, which could, in Moscow's perspective, justify the ongoing invasion.[111] This is even more evident in light of a competing line of state-media reporting, where the Kremlin does not accuse any specific government of cyberattacks, instead focusing on the United States, NATO countries, and Ukraine merely as territories where such cyberattacks have originated, or on cyber groups and\"couch hackers\"from Ukraine, the United States, 109Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation,\"Zayavlenie MID Rossii V Svyazi S Prodolzhayushcheisya Kiberagressiei So Storony 'Kollektivnogo Zapada\"[Statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Ongoing Cyber Aggression of the 'Collective West'], March 29, 2022, https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1806906/;\"MID Obvinil SSHA V Provedenii Kiberatak Protiv Rossii Rukami Ukraine\"[The Foreign Ministry Accused the United States of Carrying Out Cyberattacks Against Russia at the Hands of Ukraine], RBC, October 25, 2022, https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/635763059a794795ca558d0e;\"V MID Zayavili, Chto Microsoft Lishaet Ukrainu Tsifrovoi Samostoyatel'nosti\"[The Foreign Ministry Claims That Microsoft Is Depriving Ukraine of Digital Independence], RIA Novosti, July 18, 2022, https://ria.ru/20220718/microsoft-1803305452.html;\"FSB Zayavila, Chto Za Massirovannymi Kiberatakami Iz Ukrainy Protiv RF Stoyat Pentagon I NATO\"[FSB Claims That the Pentagon and NATO Are Behind Massive Cyberattacks from Ukraine Against the Russian Federation], TASS, April 13,2023, https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17515409;\"Patrushev Obvinil SSHA V Organizatsii Kiberatak 'Pod Ukrainskim Flagom'\"[Patrushev Accused the United States of Organizing Cyberattacks 'under the Ukrainian Flag'], TASS, July 24, 2023, https://tass.ru/politika/18349119.\n110\"Patrushev Rasskazal Ob Ukrainskikh Kiberatakakh Na Rossiyu Pod Rukovodstvom SSHA\"[Patrushev on Ukrainian Cyberattacks Against Russia Led by the United States], RIA Novosti, July 24, 2023, https://ria.ru/20230724/kiberataki-1885989781.html.\n111RIA Novosti,\"V MID zayavili.\"# R. KOLODII Georgia, Poland, Turkey and European Union that could be behind them. At times, Moscow even refers to Ukraine's IT Army as a hacker group rather than part of the Ukrainian government, possibly in a bid to minimize its role as an element of Ukraine's state agency. Characteristically, Peskov interpreted attempts to link all foreign cyberattacks against Russia originating on the US territory with the White House as absurd, and Patrushev's deputy Khramov—while acknowledging more than 5,000 foreign cyber-intrusions against Russia since February 2022—straightforwardly called the practice of political attribution of computer attacks unacceptable for Russia. The Kremlin has thus stopped short of publicly implementing any specific punitive measures against state sponsors of foreign cyberattacks and maintained ambiguity regarding its reporting of foreign cyberattacks post-2022, which largely conforms to its pre-war restraint.\nThese findings, apart from theoretical insight, can also be of value to the practitioner community. The Russia case of PAC, investigated through criminologically-tuned ST, challenges a popular assumption that state-sponsored cyberattacks are necessarily as much of a security issue for all nations as they are intuitively perceived to be, whether in peacetime or wartime. For policy-oriented analysis and decision-making research, it shows that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given, but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and the intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Therefore, when a government resorts to PAC, analysts are encouraged to pay close attention to how this policy choice relates to a country's technological maturity and its ability to benefit from cyberattacks in the first place.\n# Acknowledgments The author would like to express sincere gratitude to Editor-in-Chief, Ron Hassner, and the two anonymous reviewers for their nuanced and insightful feedback, which has improved the paper.

    "abstract": "Western states are increasingly holding foreign governments accountable for cyberattacks. They couple public attribution of cyberattacks (PAC) with indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns. Russia, however, while routinely subject to foreign cyber-intrusions, has seemed much less responsive toward these attacks. I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC stems from its desire to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategy stems from Moscow's technological inferiority to the West and from the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. Despite the harm to Russia, tolerance toward cybercrime helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. Merging securitization theory with criminology, I propose a novel theoretical lens to explain this phenomenon and then test it—quantitatively and qualitatively—against a large dataset of Russian-language media reports, forensic investigations, and policy documents. I argue that threat perception of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyberpower among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Gone are the days when the term hacker referred only to a computer nerd behind the keyboard looking for trouble and personal gain. Today, nation-states resort to hacking activities against each other to spy, steal, and destroy digital assets abroad. Often on the receiving end of this tendency, Western countries have made a drastic move toward public attribution of such cyberattacks (PAC), followed by indictments, sanctions, and collective \"naming and shaming\" campaigns against suspected foreign governments. In stark contrast to the West, Russia, an enfant terrible in the global cyber domain, has been quite reluctant to publicly attribute foreign cyberattacks against its assets to specific governments, least of all impose sanctions or other punitive measures in response. The dataset of 6,209 reports from key Russian state-owned media outlets, selected for Roman Kolodii is a PhD candidate at the Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

UNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE # data analysis in this paper, contains only 121 reports (1.9%) with incidents of PAC. Even these reports are not fully compliant with Western-type PAC, revealing Moscow's puzzling lenience toward foreign state-sponsored cyber-intrusions. If PAC exposes hostile acts of other states in cyberspace and provides a solid excuse for retaliation—potentially discouraging antagonistic behavior in the future—why does Russia refrain from public attribution? I argue that Russia's restraint regarding PAC is motivated by its intention to maintain the relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks. This strategic choice is the mixture of two critical factors: Moscow's technological inferiority to the West, and the strategic benefits of internationally tolerated cybercrime. The latter—despite being detrimental to Russia itself—helps the Kremlin steal foreign technology, improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and facilitate covert action against democracies abroad. By merging securitization theory with criminology and applying this framework to a vast dataset of Russian-language cyber-incident reporting, this paper provides strong interdisciplinary evidence that the security status of cyberattacks is not a given but rather is contingent upon the material distribution of cyber-power among nations and intrinsic utility of cybercrime as a political tool. Traditionally, state-led cyber-incident investigations were confidential, reaching the public mainly through investigative journalism or private cybersecurity firms, rather than government officials. While some isolated episodes of PAC—like those by the United States and Norway against China's commercial cyberespionage in 2014 and 2015—occurred sparingly in the past, after 2018 Western states shifted toward more transparency in PAC. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Norway have, individually or collectively, \"named and shamed\" Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran for unleashing cyberattacks on Western state and private organizations and infrastructures resulting in operational disruptions, data breaches, and intellectual property theft. Informally branded as \"attribution diplomacy\" under the US-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative, PAC has called for the collective imposition of real-world costs on transgressing countries. This has led the West to fortify public attributions with punitive measures, such as sweeping 1Keir Giles and Kim Hartmann, \"Silent Battle' Goes Loud: Entering a New Era of State-Avowed Cyber Conflict,\" in 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon), Tallinn, Estonia (June 2019): 1. 2Ibid., 5. 3Giles and Hartmann, \"Silent Battle,\" 5-6; Christina Wilkie, \"US, NATO and EU to Blame China for Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers,\" CNBC, 19 July 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/nato-and-eu-launch-a-cyber-security-alliance-to-confront-chinese-cyberattacks.; US Department of the Treasury, \"Treasury Sanctions Russian Federal Security Service Enablers,\" June 11, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0410. 4Christopher Ashley Ford, \"Responding to Modern Cyber Threats with Diplomacy and Deterrence,\" US Department of State, October 19, 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/responding-to-modern-cyber-threats-with-diplomacy-and-deterrence/; Josh Gold, \"The Five Eyes and Offensive Cyber Capabilities: Building a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative',\" NATO CCDCOE (2020): 20. # R.

The extant literature on the politics of PAC, scarce as it is, emphasizes PAC's deterrent function of intimidating state actors and their proxies responsible for cyberattacks, or justifying robust political response against perpetrators through denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos.6 Apart from deterrence, PAC boasts coercive potential for exposing wrongdoers publicly and, where possible, apprehending them, as well as showcasing the country's detection capabilities.7 It also has an expressive function of communicating the rules of the game in cyberspace and roles of the parties involved, which helps shape operational and normative environment of cyberattacks.8 However, the deterrent, coercive, and expressive effects of PAC do not ensue automatically, as what decides the expediency of PAC is first and foremost the incurred damage, financial, physical, or reputational.9 Importantly, deterrence through PAC has its downsides, as states tend to prioritize attribution and punishment for cyberattacks directed against their critical economic or military assets.10 Consequently, such high-value targets receive more investment in cyber-incident prevention and management and are more likely to generate political pressure from the public to retaliate, leaving vulnerabilities of low-value targets under-addressed.11 Also, PAC often foments a sense of urgency to provide more evidence to the public or right away resort to indictments, sanctions, or cyber-actions against perpetrators.12 This all may clash with the interests of decision-makers and dissuade them from PAC, thus emboldening future attacks and public anger at exploitation.13 As a result, for some societies that are particularly averse to risk and uncertainty due to societal, 5 US Department of Justice, \"Six Russian GRIJ Officers Charged in Connection with Worldwide Deployment of Destructive Malware and Other Disruptive Actions in Cyberspace,\" 19 October 2020, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and. 6 Kristen E.

Ultimately, PAC often seeks to blame familiar enemies with little evidence accessible to the public, which instigates conspiracy theories and imperils democratic accountability. The shortcomings of PAC, therefore, primarily relate to public opinion—a factor closely heeded in democratic regimes yet downplayed in tightly controlled and intently policed autocracies. As a result, PAC, with its deterrent, coercive, and expressive merits, seems like a reasonable policy choice for authoritarian countries like Russia. Nonetheless, since Moscow has not replicated the West's assertive approach toward PAC, this paper asks: what makes a nation refrain from PAC in the face of its growing significance as a foreign policy tool and its tangible strategic benefits? I answer this question incrementally. First, I develop the securitization theory of PAC by merging the Copenhagen School's securitization theory (ST) with insights from criminology. ST is a powerful tool to unravel how governments construct, rather than simply communicate, security threats and legitimize unorthodox political measures. While PAC fits into this framework, a standalone ST is not enough to explain it. States criminalize cyberattacks, yet ST has a weak conceptualization of crime and incrimination. To mitigate this theoretical deficit, I borrow from criminological thought, specifically—functionalist and labeling perspectives on crime. From their standpoint, crime can be beneficial to the state if properly constrained, while incrimination has the advantage of empowering the accuser at the expense of the accused. Given the lack of universally binding cybercrime regulations, a criminologically-enhanced ST suggests that PAC is an instrument of the states for abolishing “the normal politics” of relative impunity of state-sponsored cyberattacks and retaining a competitive edge in global technological rivalry. Whether or not a country decides to employ it depends on double asymmetry, that is—the difference in utility of cybercrime vis-à-vis its international prosecution for the said country (functionalist component) and the difference in its cyber-power relative to other states (labeling component). Subsequently, I examine Russian-language policy documents and reports on the country's cyber-incident response system and discover that its legal and organizational design is averse to PAC. I then turn to the Russian public discourse, namely a large dataset of Russian-language media reports and sporadic forensic investigations of private companies from the Russian state-owned media outlets TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti, and Lenta.ru. I then qualitatively analyzed and categorized these reports using the cyber-incident reporting matrix. This longitudinal media analysis indicates that the Kremlin tends to refrain from accusing foreign governments of state-sponsored cyberattacks. When it does so very rarely, it withholds details about the culprit or any further retributive actions. I use these empirical findings to test—and ultimately refute—five hypotheses regarding Russia's restraint: poor attribution capacity, fear of displaying vulnerability, reputational benefits of victimhood, desire not to validate Western norms, and reluctance of Russian cybersecurity firms to contradict the government. Lastly, I explain the insights from the empirical sections through the previously proposed securitization theory of PAC. Drawing on the theory's double asymmetry criterion, I first establish that Russia is inferior to the West in terms of cyberpower based on its position in the global technology supply chain and the most critical metrics of innovative development. Then, I also confirm that state-sponsored cybercrime brings Russia significant strategic benefits otherwise unattainable in an internationally regulated cyberspace. Specifically, I supply evidence that it helps Moscow steal and reverse-engineer foreign technology, test and improve its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and subvert foreign democracies. The theory thus argues that a country that does not dominate technologically yet acquires substantial benefits from cyber-intrusions both technically and politically might be inclined—despite sustaining harm from foreign cyberattacks itself—to refrain from public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks and punitive action in return. This causality, which has largely persisted even after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, eventually underscores criminologically upgraded ST as a superior explanatory lens to interrogate Russia's approach to PAC. In sum, the paper makes several contributions. First, it solves an important unaddressed puzzle in the PAC scholarship by proposing a theory that explains why a country refrains from PAC despite its strategic utility. Second, this study strengthens securitization literature by clarifying concepts of crime and incrimination in ST and the meaning of ST's concepts of speech act, exceptional measures, and normal politics in cyberspace. While ST asserts that security is a social construct, my paper also shows that material factors, namely the technological disparity between nations, still play a major role in the political construction of threats. Thirdly, the study enriches discussion on authoritarian regimes in PAC and ST scholarships, which have so far been heavily tilted toward the analysis of democracies. And finally, with a plethora of studies on Russian cyber-enabled hybrid warfare and digital authoritarianism, this paper is—to the best of my knowledge—a pioneering attempt to inspect Russia's approach to PAC, as even sporadic English-language and Russian-language papers on Russian UNPACKING RUSSIA'S CYBER-INCIDENT RESPONSE # domestic cybersecurity tend to focus primarily on its organizational, legal, or technical aspects, rather than strategic and political effects of foreign cyberattacks, including PAC and ensuing retribution.¹⁶",
