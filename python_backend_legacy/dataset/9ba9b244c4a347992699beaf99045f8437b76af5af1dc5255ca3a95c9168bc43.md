Within responsibility for violation of space law obligations cyber damage may be recovered as the result of violation of control over space objects or as harmful interference with space activities. Violation of due diligence obligation to protect space objects (as cyber threats became more vivid) and use of force by cyber means are basis for cyber damage recovery under general international law. Damage to space objects, inflicted during an armed conflict, is recoverable for violation of principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.\n1. Introduction\nOn the background of ongoing technological developments more and more legal lacunas in regulation of space activities arise. One of them is recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects by cyber means (for purposes of the present paper further \"cyber damage\").\nThe background of cyber damage recovery is traced to general issues of damage in space law, responsibility and liability, $^{1}$ analysis of existing practice\n* Darya Bohdan, PhD Student at Department of International Law, Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus.

Mejía-Kaiser⁶ and S.A. Kaiser,⁷ who detail technical peculiarities of space objects functionality and propose future developments of international law.\nMeanwhile the research of legal regime for cyber activities, including relating to space objects, and proposals for future developments of law do not provide answers to modalities of financial recovery of suffered damage under existing regulation.\nThe objective of the present work is to provide legal solutions for recovery of cyber damage based on current legal framework. With this purpose types of cyber damage are presented (Section 2) and existing legal regulation of recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, is analysed (Section 3). Then the author gives the discussion on topical legal challenges, related to cyber damage to space objects: attribution of cyber activity, determination of applicants and respondents in recovery claims and legality of damaging space objects with multiple launching states (Section 4). Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser⁸ types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments⁹ as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.¹⁰\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n6 M.

Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST)¹² declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims,¹³ what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).¹⁴\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter.¹⁵ Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force¹⁶ (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities¹⁷), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n¹¹ Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n¹² Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n¹³ Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n¹⁴ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n¹⁵ Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n¹⁶ Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n¹⁷ Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nof force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence¹⁸ under Art.51 UN Charter.¹⁹\nCompensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”.²⁰ Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB)²¹ specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).²²\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision,²³ including collision with space debris²⁴ and crashes on the Earth.²⁵\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;²⁶\n- and includes economic loss.²⁷\n18 Ibid., p.255.\n19 Ibid.\n20 Commentaries supra note 14, pp.99-101,105.\n21 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 29 March 1972), 961 UNTS 187, entry into force 1 Sep. 1972.\n22 Dunk supra note 1, pp.365-366; M.

Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC).²⁹ Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities,³⁰ including cyber-related:\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);³¹\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);³²\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).³³\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict.³⁴ When states have integrated civilian-military space industry³⁵ it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian.³⁶ On the other hand, change of space object\n28 Burke *supra* note 2, p.282.\n29 Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Filed (Geneva, 12 Aug. 1949), Final Record of the Dipl.

Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.³⁷\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.³⁸\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”.³⁹ However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.⁴⁰\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it.⁴¹ With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n37 Богдан (2020) supra note 5, p.30.\n38 Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.57.\n39 The International Court of Justice, Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) Judgment of 13 July 2009, 2009, https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/133/133-20090713-JUD-01-00_EN.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), pp.242-243.\n40 Kaiser supra note 7, p.399.\n41 Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.62.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.⁴²\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.⁴³\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.⁴⁴\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest;⁴⁵ breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state,⁴⁶ thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals.⁴⁷ Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection⁴⁸).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.⁴⁹\n⁴² *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n⁴³ *Ibid.*, p.63.\n⁴⁴ *Ibid.*, p.64.\n⁴⁵ Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n⁴⁶ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n⁴⁷ Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n⁴⁸ *Supra* note 64.\n⁴⁹ Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment.⁵⁰ Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim.⁵¹ Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties,⁵² not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n⁵⁰ Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n53 Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.157.\n54 Ibid., p.177.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take.⁵⁵ In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself.

Within responsibility for violation of space law obligations cyber damage may be recovered as the result of violation of control over space objects or as harmful interference with space activities. Violation of due diligence obligation to protect space objects (as cyber threats became more vivid) and use of force by cyber means are basis for cyber damage recovery under general international law. Damage to space objects, inflicted during an armed conflict, is recoverable for violation of principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.\n1. Introduction\nOn the background of ongoing technological developments more and more legal lacunas in regulation of space activities arise. One of them is recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects by cyber means (for purposes of the present paper further \"cyber damage\").\nThe background of cyber damage recovery is traced to general issues of damage in space law, responsibility and liability, $^{1}$ analysis of existing practice\n* Darya Bohdan, PhD Student at Department of International Law, Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus.

Foster, The Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, the Canadian Yearbook of Int. Law (1972) 137-185.; P.S. Dempsey, Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects under International and National Law, IAC-11.E7.2.9, 62nd International Astronautical Congress, Cape Town, South Africa, 2011, 3-7 October.\n\nSpecific legal issues, related to cyber damage, are researched by M. Mejía-Kaiser and S.A. Kaiser, who detail technical peculiarities of space objects functionality and propose future developments of international law.\nMeanwhile the research of legal regime for cyber activities, including relating to space objects, and proposals for future developments of law do not provide answers to modalities of financial recovery of suffered damage under existing regulation.\nThe objective of the present work is to provide legal solutions for recovery of cyber damage based on current legal framework. With this purpose types of cyber damage are presented (Section 2) and existing legal regulation of recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, is analysed (Section 3). Then the author gives the discussion on topical legal challenges, related to cyber damage to space objects: attribution of cyber activity, determination of applicants and respondents in recovery claims and legality of damaging space objects with multiple launching states (Section 4). Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nCyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).\n## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST) declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims, what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter. Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nof force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence under Art.51 UN Charter.\nCompensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”. Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB) specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision, including collision with space debris and crashes on the Earth.\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;\n- and includes economic loss.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nThe reasoning is Art.XII LIAB referring to compensation in amount, necessary to restore the victim to condition, “which would have existed if damage had not occurred” (restitutio in integrum), what shall cover indirect damage. Here, we shall point out, that space debris increase (damage to space environment) may be used to raise compensation amount under LIAB as evaluation of restitutio in integrum.\nIn time of armed conflict IHL applies as *lex specialis*. Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC). Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities, including cyber-related:\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict. When states have integrated civilian-military space industry it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian. On the other hand, change of space object\n\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nfunctioning regime triggers change in protection regime. Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”. However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it. With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest; breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state, thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals. Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.\n *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n *Ibid.*, p.63.\n *Ibid.*, p.64.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n *Supra* note 64.\n Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment. Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim. Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties, not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n Ibid.\n Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take. In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions. In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s, thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result. If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework\nThere are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n Ibid.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n## 6. Conclusions\nRecovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object.

On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]",

    "## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences Based on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser⁸ types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments⁹ as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.": "Means, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.¹⁰ rymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Cyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).¹¹ ## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects Existing international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST)¹² declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims,¹³ what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).¹⁴ Specific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter.¹⁵ Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force¹⁶ (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities¹⁷), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use ¹¹ Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n¹² Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n¹³ Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n¹⁴ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n¹⁵ Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n¹⁶ Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n¹⁷ Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE of force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence¹⁸ under Art.51 UN Charter.¹⁹ Compensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”.²⁰ Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB)²¹ specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).²² Initially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision,²³ including collision with space debris²⁴ and crashes on the Earth.²⁵ Currently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when: - it follows from “the initial damaging event”; - it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event; - it is not too remote, is foreseeable; - it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage; - estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;²⁶ - and includes economic loss.²⁷ PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 The reasoning is Art.XII LIAB referring to compensation in amount, necessary to restore the victim to condition, “which would have existed if damage had not occurred” (restitutio in integrum), what shall cover indirect damage.²⁸ Here, we shall point out, that space debris increase (damage to space environment) may be used to raise compensation amount under LIAB as evaluation of restitutio in integrum.\nIn time of armed conflict IHL applies as *lex specialis*. Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC).²⁹ Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities,³⁰ including cyber-related: - principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);³¹ - principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);³² - principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).³³ Space law also continue to apply during an armed conflict.³⁴ When states have integrated civilian-military space industry³⁵ it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian.³⁶ On the other hand, change of space object SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE functioning regime triggers change in protection regime. Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.³⁷ ## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage Cyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.³⁸ The key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”.³⁹ However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.",
    "## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State Attribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.⁴⁰ Nevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it.⁴¹ With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Proposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.⁴² Both of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.⁴³ We support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.⁴⁴ ## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage Under international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest;⁴⁵ breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state,⁴⁶ thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals.⁴⁷ Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection⁴⁸).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.⁴⁹ ⁴² *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n⁴³ *Ibid.*, p.63.\n⁴⁴ *Ibid.*, p.64.\n⁴⁵ Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n⁴⁶ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n⁴⁷ Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n⁴⁸ *Supra* note 64.\n⁴⁹ Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE In any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment.⁵⁰ Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim.⁵¹ Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties,⁵² not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.",
    "## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL As space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.": "Consequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n⁵⁰ Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 ## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework Techniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on: In other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.",
    "## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB CD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.": "During LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that: when CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery; when CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery; damage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE as special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by\"fault\"in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.",
    "## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage Can cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?": "There is no agreed definition of\"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not\"space activity\"under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it.\"Control\"may be defined as\"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\"(B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Recovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take.⁵⁵ In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.",
    "## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law Meanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions.⁵⁶ In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.": "Damaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s,⁵⁷ thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result.⁵⁸ If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.",
    "## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework There are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.": "Peculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n⁵⁷ Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n⁵⁸ Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE ## 6. Conclusions Recovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]"

Within responsibility for violation of space law obligations cyber damage may be recovered as the result of violation of control over space objects or as harmful interference with space activities. Violation of due diligence obligation to protect space objects (as cyber threats became more vivid) and use of force by cyber means are basis for cyber damage recovery under general international law. Damage to space objects, inflicted during an armed conflict, is recoverable for violation of principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.\n1.

Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nCyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).\n## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST) declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims, what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter. Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nof force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence under Art.51 UN Charter.\nCompensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”. Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB) specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision, including collision with space debris and crashes on the Earth.\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;\n- and includes economic loss.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nThe reasoning is Art.XII LIAB referring to compensation in amount, necessary to restore the victim to condition, “which would have existed if damage had not occurred” (restitutio in integrum), what shall cover indirect damage. Here, we shall point out, that space debris increase (damage to space environment) may be used to raise compensation amount under LIAB as evaluation of restitutio in integrum.\nIn time of armed conflict IHL applies as *lex specialis*. Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC). Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities, including cyber-related:\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict. When states have integrated civilian-military space industry it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian. On the other hand, change of space object\n\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nfunctioning regime triggers change in protection regime. Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”. However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it. With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest; breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state, thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals. Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.\n *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n *Ibid.*, p.63.\n *Ibid.*, p.64.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n *Supra* note 64.\n Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment. Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim. Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties, not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n Ibid.\n Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take. In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions. In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s, thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result. If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework\nThere are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n Ibid.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n## 6. Conclusions\nRecovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]",

Dempsey, Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects under International and National Law, IAC-11.E7.2.9, 62nd International Astronautical Congress, Cape Town, South Africa, 2011, 3-7 October.\n\nSpecific legal issues, related to cyber damage, are researched by M. Mejía-Kaiser and S.A. Kaiser, who detail technical peculiarities of space objects functionality and propose future developments of international law.\nMeanwhile the research of legal regime for cyber activities, including relating to space objects, and proposals for future developments of law do not provide answers to modalities of financial recovery of suffered damage under existing regulation.\nThe objective of the present work is to provide legal solutions for recovery of cyber damage based on current legal framework. With this purpose types of cyber damage are presented (Section 2) and existing legal regulation of recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, is analysed (Section 3). Then the author gives the discussion on topical legal challenges, related to cyber damage to space objects: attribution of cyber activity, determination of applicants and respondents in recovery claims and legality of damaging space objects with multiple launching states (Section 4). Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nCyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).\n## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST) declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims, what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter. Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nof force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence under Art.51 UN Charter.\nCompensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”. Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB) specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision, including collision with space debris and crashes on the Earth.\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;\n- and includes economic loss.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nThe reasoning is Art.XII LIAB referring to compensation in amount, necessary to restore the victim to condition, “which would have existed if damage had not occurred” (restitutio in integrum), what shall cover indirect damage. Here, we shall point out, that space debris increase (damage to space environment) may be used to raise compensation amount under LIAB as evaluation of restitutio in integrum.\nIn time of armed conflict IHL applies as *lex specialis*. Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC). Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities, including cyber-related:\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict. When states have integrated civilian-military space industry it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian. On the other hand, change of space object\n\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nfunctioning regime triggers change in protection regime. Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”. However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it. With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest; breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state, thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals. Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.\n *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n *Ibid.*, p.63.\n *Ibid.*, p.64.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n *Supra* note 64.\n Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment. Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim. Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties, not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n Ibid.\n Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take. In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions. In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s, thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result. If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework\nThere are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n Ibid.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n## 6. Conclusions\nRecovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]"

Mejía-Kaiser⁶ and S.A. Kaiser,⁷ who detail technical peculiarities of space objects functionality and propose future developments of international law.\nMeanwhile the research of legal regime for cyber activities, including relating to space objects, and proposals for future developments of law do not provide answers to modalities of financial recovery of suffered damage under existing regulation.\nThe objective of the present work is to provide legal solutions for recovery of cyber damage based on current legal framework. With this purpose types of cyber damage are presented (Section 2) and existing legal regulation of recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, is analysed (Section 3). Then the author gives the discussion on topical legal challenges, related to cyber damage to space objects: attribution of cyber activity, determination of applicants and respondents in recovery claims and legality of damaging space objects with multiple launching states (Section 4). Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser⁸ types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments⁹ as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.¹⁰\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n6 M.

Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST)¹² declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims,¹³ what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).¹⁴\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter.¹⁵ Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force¹⁶ (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities¹⁷), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n¹¹ Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n¹² Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n¹³ Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n¹⁴ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n¹⁵ Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n¹⁶ Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n¹⁷ Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nof force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence¹⁸ under Art.51 UN Charter.¹⁹\nCompensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”.²⁰ Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB)²¹ specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).²²\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision,²³ including collision with space debris²⁴ and crashes on the Earth.²⁵\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;²⁶\n- and includes economic loss.²⁷\n18 Ibid., p.255.\n19 Ibid.\n20 Commentaries supra note 14, pp.99-101,105.\n21 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 29 March 1972), 961 UNTS 187, entry into force 1 Sep. 1972.\n22 Dunk supra note 1, pp.365-366; M.

Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC).²⁹ Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities,³⁰ including cyber-related:\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);³¹\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);³²\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).³³\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict.³⁴ When states have integrated civilian-military space industry³⁵ it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian.³⁶ On the other hand, change of space object\n28 Burke *supra* note 2, p.282.\n29 Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Filed (Geneva, 12 Aug. 1949), Final Record of the Dipl.

Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.³⁷\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.³⁸\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”.³⁹ However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.⁴⁰\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it.⁴¹ With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n37 Богдан (2020) supra note 5, p.30.\n38 Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.57.\n39 The International Court of Justice, Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) Judgment of 13 July 2009, 2009, https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/133/133-20090713-JUD-01-00_EN.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), pp.242-243.\n40 Kaiser supra note 7, p.399.\n41 Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.62.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.⁴²\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.⁴³\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.⁴⁴\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest;⁴⁵ breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state,⁴⁶ thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals.⁴⁷ Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection⁴⁸).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.⁴⁹\n⁴² *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n⁴³ *Ibid.*, p.63.\n⁴⁴ *Ibid.*, p.64.\n⁴⁵ Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n⁴⁶ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n⁴⁷ Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n⁴⁸ *Supra* note 64.\n⁴⁹ Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment.⁵⁰ Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim.⁵¹ Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties,⁵² not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n⁵⁰ Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n53 Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.157.\n54 Ibid., p.177.\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take.⁵⁵ In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions.⁵⁶ In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s,⁵⁷ thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result.⁵⁸ If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework\nThere are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n⁵⁷ Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n⁵⁸ Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n## 6. Conclusions\nRecovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]"

Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences Based on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser⁸ types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments⁹ as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.¹⁰ rymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Cyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).¹¹ ## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects Existing international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST)¹² declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims,¹³ what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).¹⁴ Specific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter.¹⁵ Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force¹⁶ (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities¹⁷), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use ¹¹ Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n¹² Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n¹³ Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n¹⁴ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n¹⁵ Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n¹⁶ Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n¹⁷ Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE of force by cyber means also triggers the right to self-defence¹⁸ under Art.51 UN Charter.¹⁹ Compensation in state responsibility is secondary and covers “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established” (Art.36.2 ARS). Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”.²⁰ Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB)²¹ specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).²² Initially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision,²³ including collision with space debris²⁴ and crashes on the Earth.²⁵ Currently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when: - it follows from “the initial damaging event”; - it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event; - it is not too remote, is foreseeable; - it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage; - estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;²⁶ - and includes economic loss.²⁷ PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 The reasoning is Art.XII LIAB referring to compensation in amount, necessary to restore the victim to condition, “which would have existed if damage had not occurred” (restitutio in integrum), what shall cover indirect damage.²⁸ Here, we shall point out, that space debris increase (damage to space environment) may be used to raise compensation amount under LIAB as evaluation of restitutio in integrum.\nIn time of armed conflict IHL applies as *lex specialis*. Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC).²⁹ Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities,³⁰ including cyber-related: - principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);³¹ - principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);³² - principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).³³ Space law also continue to apply during an armed conflict.³⁴ When states have integrated civilian-military space industry³⁵ it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict). Thus, register of space objects – public primary source of information about them – shall be consulted for verification of whether the object is military or civilian.³⁶ On the other hand, change of space object SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE functioning regime triggers change in protection regime. Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.³⁷ ## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage Cyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.³⁸ The key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”.³⁹ However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State Attribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.⁴⁰ Nevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it.⁴¹ With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Proposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.⁴² Both of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.⁴³ We support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.⁴⁴ ## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage Under international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest;⁴⁵ breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state,⁴⁶ thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals.⁴⁷ Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection⁴⁸).\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.⁴⁹ ⁴² *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n⁴³ *Ibid.*, p.63.\n⁴⁴ *Ibid.*, p.64.\n⁴⁵ Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n⁴⁶ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n⁴⁷ Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n⁴⁸ *Supra* note 64.\n⁴⁹ Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE In any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment.⁵⁰ Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim.⁵¹ Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties,⁵² not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL As space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n⁵⁰ Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 ## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework Techniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on: In other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB CD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that: when CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery; when CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery; damage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE as special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by\"fault\"in Art.III LIAB.\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage Can cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\nThere is no agreed definition of\"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not\"space activity\"under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it.\"Control\"may be defined as\"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\"(B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020 Recovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take.⁵⁵ In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law Meanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions.⁵⁶ In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s,⁵⁷ thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result.⁵⁸ If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework There are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n⁵⁷ Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n⁵⁸ Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.\nSPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE ## 6. Conclusions Recovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).\n^{}[]"

    "Space Law Challenges for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects by Cyber Means\n\nDarya Bohdan*\n\nAbstract\n\nThe paper analyses existing models for recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, and addresses major challenges, related to cyber damage: the issue of attribution, procedural issues of cyber damage recovery, possibility to recover space damage, inflicted during an armed conflict.\n\nA proposal is made to consider cyber damage as direct damage under space law liability regime and evaluate resulting increase of space debris (damage to space environment) for the purposes of compensation amount. Within responsibility for violation of space law obligations cyber damage may be recovered as the result of violation of control over space objects or as harmful interference with space activities. Violation of due diligence obligation to protect space objects (as cyber threats became more vivid) and use of force by cyber means are basis for cyber damage recovery under general international law. Damage to space objects, inflicted during an armed conflict, is recoverable for violation of principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nOn the background of ongoing technological developments more and more legal lacunas in regulation of space activities arise. One of them is recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects by cyber means (for purposes of the present paper further \"cyber damage\").\n\nThe background of cyber damage recovery is traced to general issues of damage in space law, responsibility and liability, $^{1}$ analysis of existing practice\n\n* Darya Bohdan, PhD Student at Department of International Law, Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus.

    "SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n\nSpecific legal issues, related to cyber damage, are researched by M. Mejía-Kaiser⁶ and S.A. Kaiser,⁷ who detail technical peculiarities of space objects functionality and propose future developments of international law.\n\nMeanwhile the research of legal regime for cyber activities, including relating to space objects, and proposals for future developments of law do not provide answers to modalities of financial recovery of suffered damage under existing regulation.\n\nThe objective of the present work is to provide legal solutions for recovery of cyber damage based on current legal framework. With this purpose types of cyber damage are presented (Section 2) and existing legal regulation of recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, is analysed (Section 3). Then the author gives the discussion on topical legal challenges, related to cyber damage to space objects: attribution of cyber activity, determination of applicants and respondents in recovery claims and legality of damaging space objects with multiple launching states (Section 4). Models for recovery of cyber damage are proposed (Section 5) and, finally, conclusions are made (Section 6).\n\nThe present paper is shortcut version of the paper for 71st International Astronautical Congress IAC-20-E7,4,9x60590.\n\n## 2. Cyber Damage: Types, Means of Infliction, Consequences\n\nBased on classification of vulnerable infrastructure given by S.A. Kaiser and M. Mejía-Kaiser⁸ types of cyber damage may be given in the following way: on-ground damage (“terrestrial segment”), damage in space (“space segment”) and damage “to peripheral systems, necessary for the operation of space systems” (not necessary connected to terrestrial segment of particular space object). The disruption of communication links between ground and space segments⁹ as cyber damage, from our perspective, shall be included into damage to peripheral systems.\n\nMeans, by which cyber damage can be inflicted, are diverse: with the use of the Internet, Universal Serial Bus devices, transmission through a powerful radio signal.¹⁰\n\nrymaHnTaHOrO npaBa, npHMeHHMIX K JeTeJIbHocTH B KOCMHueCKOM npoctpaHCTBe, AkTyJIbHbIe npo6JIeMbIMITI H CMI 1 (2020) 26-33.\n\n6 M.

    "PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n\nCyber damage may lead to a variety of consequences, among which, but not limited to, are unauthorized usage of space object information, damage to space object soft- and hardware, manipulation of space object in unauthorized ways, including infliction of damage to other space objects, detriment to economic and society development in communication, transport, energy, financial, agriculture, environment and other sectors (as nowadays many of them are dependent on space-based infrastructure).¹¹\n\n## 3. Current Framework for Recovery of Damage, Inflicted to Space Objects\n\nExisting international law treaties regulate general issues of recovery of damage in peace time and during armed conflict without any specification given to cyber means. National pieces of regulation, related to space activities will not be considered, as currently limited number of states has developed national space law.\n\nArt.VI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (OST)¹² declares state responsibility for all national space activities irrespective of entity, which carries it out, governmental or non-governmental.\n\nIn their turn, Art.IX OST taken with Art.III OST (obligation to carry out space activity in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promote international co-operation and understanding), Art.VI OST (responsibility for national space activities) and Art.VII OST (liability for damage, caused by space object) justify OST application as legal basis for debris pollution claims,¹³ what may take place after cyber-caused space objects collision.\n\nAlso states bear responsibility for OST and other obligations violation under general customary international law of responsibility, codified in Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS).¹⁴\n\nSpecific here is use of force, prohibited under Art.2.4 UN Charter.¹⁵ Thus, when cyber attacks amount to use of force¹⁶ (due to cyber nature additional factors shall be evaluated such as the purpose of attack, repetitiveness and other military activities¹⁷), responsibility is triggered. On the other hand, use\n\n¹¹ Ibid., pp.350-351; Livingstone supra note 4, pp.23,36.\n\n¹² Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 27 Jan. 1967), 610 UNTS 205, entry into force 10 Oct. 1967.\n\n¹³ Commentary (2013) supra note 1, p.193.\n\n¹⁴ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, 2001, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).\n\n¹⁵ Roscini supra note 5, p.233.\n\n¹⁶ Focarelli supra note 5, p.265.\n\n¹⁷ Tronchetti supra note 5, p.355.",

Damage under compensation may be direct or incidental, caused to state or to its nationals and demanded under diplomatic protection, based on “causation, remoteness, evidentiary requirements and accounting principles, which seek to discount speculative elements from projected figures”.²⁰ Even in circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, state shall compensate inflicted injury (Art.27 ARS).\n\nMeanwhile the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (LIAB)²¹ specifies regulation for recovery of damage, inflicted by space objects, during lawful activities and is lex specialis.\n\nThe Convention operates with two regimes of liability: absolute and “fault-based”. However, “fault” is not clarified and is widely discussed in doctrine. The conclusion is that fault for LIAB purposes is either intent (willful misconduct) or negligence (failure to take reasonable care).²²\n\nInitially LIAB covered only direct damage, resulted from space object physical collision,²³ including collision with space debris²⁴ and crashes on the Earth.²⁵\n\nCurrently, the doctrine considers LIAB as basis for recovery of indirect damage, when:\n\n- it follows from “the initial damaging event”;\n- it may not occur locally or immediately, but as a consequence of or during a chain of events after damaging event;\n- it is not too remote, is foreseeable;\n- it would not occur, if there had been no initial damage;\n- estimation period for damage is one year from initial impact;²⁶\n- and includes economic loss.²⁷\n\n18 Ibid., p.255.\n19 Ibid.\n20 Commentaries supra note 14, pp.99-101,105.\n21 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. 29 March 1972), 961 UNTS 187, entry into force 1 Sep. 1972.\n22 Dunk supra note 1, pp.365-366; M.

Many IHL norms are of customary nature, which also are codified in four Geneva Conventions dated 1949 (GC).²⁹ Besides Art.1-3, common for four GC, applicable to any armed conflict irrespective of its place and persons involved, core principles of IHL are also applicable to space activities,³⁰ including cyber-related:\n\n- principle of distinction (only attacks on combatants and military objectives are legal, duty to protect civilian population and civilian objects);³¹\n- principle of proportionality (acts, causing incidental or excessive damage to civilians and civilian objects, are prohibited);³²\n- principle of precautions in attack (demands to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects during armed activities).³³\n\nSpace law also continue to apply during an armed conflict.³⁴ When states have integrated civilian-military space industry³⁵ it complicates space object clarification as legitimate target (only *military* objects of an opposite party of armed conflict).

Military objects, used purely for civilian purposes, enjoy protection while civilian, used purely for military purposes, lose it. Simultaneously, change in civilian object functionality demands higher standard of prove than military.\n\nThis is also true in respect of space stations as a special kind of a space object. When a space station consists of several modules, belonging to different states, attack on a whole station to target an enemy without complete evidences that civil personnel of other states is absent is contrary to principles of distinction and precautions in attack.³⁷\n\n## 4. Challenges for Recovery of Cyber Damage\n\nCyber possibilities for damage causation were not known at time of OST and LIAB adoption. At the same time each technological evolution should not create an impression that lack of regulatory framework leads to possibility of any behavior.³⁸\n\nThe key in “updating” existing legal rules without their amendment is interpretation. The Navigational Rights Case clarified that “terms used in a treaty must be interpreted in light of what is determined to have been the parties’ common intention” and meaning is “intended to follow the evolution of the law”.³⁹ However, we shall carefully preserve the balance and do not interpret treaties too broadly and include external notions and content.\n\n## 4.1. Attribution of Cyber Acts to a State\n\nAttribution is an element of an internationally wrongful act, which also comes to our attention during fault-liability usually under LIAB. The difficulty in identification of cyber activity perpetrator is considered to be an obstacle for attribution, but studies show that cyber activities tracing is possible.⁴⁰\n\nNevertheless, the major problem of cyber activity attribution is that we can identify the object, used for action, but hardly ever the person, committing it.⁴¹ With this we cannot be sure whether particular cyber action against space objects can be attributable to a state, as attribution rules require conduct, not mere usage of state equipment.\n\n37 Богдан (2020) supra note 5, p.30.\n38 Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.57.\n39 The International Court of Justice, Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v.

    "PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n\nProposals for cyber activity attribution are that either state discloses, who operated its devices, traced for cyber activity, or presumption is made that cyber activity is attributable to territorial state.⁴²\n\nBoth of these seem to be non-working options: a state, violating its obligations, hardly ever will disclose this voluntarily; and the Corfu Channel Case by the International Court of Justice established that mere existence of dangerous items on state territory does not impose violation of obligations on this state.⁴³\n\nWe support the point of view that the solution for problem of cyber acts attribution is found in more flexible approach to evidence. For the sake of unlawful cyber activity attribution such evidences shall be evaluated as expert technical knowledge, press reports and statement of public officials of concerned state.⁴⁴\n\n## 4.2. Applicants and Respondents in Recovery of Cyber Damage\n\nUnder international space law applicants and respondents are states. Within the regime of state responsibility a state is eligible to file a claim against respondent when: it suffered injury (Art.42 ARS); breached obligation is *erga omnes partes* (Art.48.1.a ARS), owed to a group, to which an injured state belongs, and such obligation protects the collective interest;⁴⁵ breached obligation is owed to an international community as a whole (Art.48.1.b ARS). A special case is diplomatic protection of nationals. Injury to nationals (physical and juridical persons) is considered as injury to a state,⁴⁶ thus state is eligible to file a claim, receive compensation for further payment to nationals.⁴⁷ Conditions for diplomatic protection are exhaustion of local remedies by nationals and nationality link between the applicant state and injured nationals (Art.1 and Art.14 of Articles of Diplomatic Protection⁴⁸).\n\nAt the same time Art.IX LIAB directly refers to diplomatic protection. When a state of nationality does not file a claim for damage, nationals may resort to a state, on whose territory the damage was sustained, or to a state, where private persons are permanent residents (Art.VIII LIAB). Despite LIAB does not prohibit usage of local remedies, that can be done by respective national law of a state.⁴⁹\n\n⁴² *Ibid.*, pp.62,64.\n\n⁴³ *Ibid.*, p.63.\n\n⁴⁴ *Ibid.*, p.64.\n\n⁴⁵ Commentaries *supra* note 14, p.126.\n\n⁴⁶ The United Nations, Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries, 2006, https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_8_2006.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021), p.22.\n\n⁴⁷ Commentaries *supra* note 14, pp.99,110.\n\n⁴⁸ *Supra* note 64.\n\n⁴⁹ Dempsey *supra* note 1, pp.4-5.",
    "SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n\nIn any event, cyber damage to public and private space objects is recoverable. Recovery of damage to space environment raises additional questions. Here, as outer space is general sphere for space activities, it seems that many more actors than one or several, whose space object was damaged, may be found injured.\n\nLegal nature of outer space (res communis omnium) gives right to anyone, who considers growing debris as an injury, right to file a claim for protection of space environment.⁵⁰ Obligation to protect space environment under Art.IX OST is erga omnes partes, thus any OST party also may file a claim.⁵¹ Both cases leave room for further deliberations on actor, whom compensation may be awarded. From our perspective, compensation for space environmental damage per se shall not be awarded. The reason is that if it shall be paid, it shall be given to all 110 OST parties,⁵² not only to initial applicant. This does not follow the idea of international responsibility – cessation of wrongful activities and restitution of situation before the breach of an obligation, but rather serves as penalty.\n\n## 4.3. Plurality of Launching States of a Space Object and Compliance With IHL\n\nAs space law treaties do not cease its force during an armed conflict, space objects having plurality of launching states, do not “lose” those, who are not party to an armed conflict.\n\nConsequently, infliction of cyber damage to space objects with at least one launching state, which is not party to a conflict, is illegal for attacking state under principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Further any launching state, not involved into an armed conflict, is eligible to file a claim for inflicted damage. Meanwhile those launching states, who participate in armed conflict, lose their right to file a claim for damage as their military objects are eligible targets.\n\nCurrently several states have capabilities to launch space objects, thus it seems hard to justify cyber damage to a space object with plurality of launching states. Special case is that all of them shall belong to one security block and thus shall all be involved in an armed conflict on one side. However, if one of them is protecting power or keeps neutrality this case does not work and damage still shall be considered illegal. Maybe, that is a hidden obstacle for a space war.\n\n⁵⁰ Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.177.\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² Status of International Agreements Relating to Activities in Outer Space as at 1 January 2020, https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/treatystatus/TreatiesStatus-2020E.pdf, (accessed 15.01.2021).",
    "PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n\n## 5. Models for Cyber Damage Recovery Under Existing Legal Framework\n\nTechniques of cyber damage infliction, from our point of view, are not crucial for the purposes of responsibility and liability for damage caused.\n\nOn the other hand, responsibility and liability for cyber damage may vary depending on its consequences, what directly influences recovery of inflicted damage. For the purposes of current legal research and formulation of legal models for recovery of cyber damage, we propose to divide cyber damage on:\n\n1) cyber damage, harming estimated functionality of space objects (CD-I), \"pure cyber damage\";\n2) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight (CD-II) and\n3) cyber damage to space objects resulting in infliction of damage to other space object (CD-III).\n\nIn other words, both CD-II and CD-III consist of CD-I and additional inflicted damage. We shall notice that mentioned additional damage is inflicted by space object and thus its recovery shall be governed by discussed above legal approaches.\n\nCD-I, in its turn, is damage inflicted to space object, not by it. In combined scenarios (CD-II and CD-III) CD-I shall be recovered by respective liable/responsible state under regress procedure. Meanwhile, new approaches for recovery of cyber damage shall be proposed and let us formulate them in turn.\n\n## 5.1. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under LIAB\n\nCD-I is caused by cyber interference. This addresses us to notion of damage under LIAB and possibility of its infliction by means other than physical collision with a space object.\n\nDuring LIAB drafting cyber means were not treated as a real instrument for damage causation. At the same time each space object is aimed to receive and transmit signals. Bearing in mind necessity of up-to-date approach to legal regulation, based on technical background and taking into consideration modern technological development we propose that:\n\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, such damage shall be considered as direct damage under Art.III LIAB and be subject to recovery;\n\nwhen CD-I is inflicted by a space object, located in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth, to ground element or peripheral systems of another space object this also shall be covered as direct damage under Art.II and Art.III LIAB respectively and be subject to recovery;\n\ndamage to space environment as the result of space debris increase shall be considered for restitutio in integrum and evaluation of compensation, but not",
    "SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n\nas special type of cyber damage, recovered under LIAB. Approaches to compensation estimation are subject to further deliberations.\n\nThere is a room for deliberation whether such infliction of damage is lawful activity and can be considered under liability regime instead of responsibility. Our position is that damage to ground systems is subject to absolute liability in any event. In their turn damage to peripheral systems and to a space object in a place elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth shall be considered as intent (as international wrongful act) or negligence (if incidentally due to some reasons cyber activity of a space object harmed another one), what is covered by \"fault\" in Art.III LIAB.\n\nContrary to proposed above, if CD-I is inflicted not by a space object, LIAB shall not apply and other rules shall be enforced.\n\n## 5.2. OST as a Ground for Recovery of Cyber Damage\n\nCan cyber activity, aimed at damaging space objects, be considered as national space activity, which shall be authorized under Art.VI OST? Is cyber activity, targeted at space object, a priori attributable to a state?\n\nThere is no agreed definition of \"space activity\", but place of such activity does not play role: space object launching, supervision, monitoring, etc. are conducted from the ground, but are space activity. With this either cyber damage is inflicted from space or from the Earth, its focus on a space is decisive. Does this activity have another element – state authorization? That is doubtful that a state will authorize cyber damaging actions (in peacetime).\n\nConsequently, our opinion is that damaging cyber activity is not \"space activity\" under Art.VI OST and CD-I cannot be recovered on this basis.\n\nArt.VIII OST declares that state, in whose registry space object is included, retains control over it. \"Control\" may be defined as \"exclusive right and actual possibility to supervise the activities of a space object\" (B.Schmidt-Tedd and S.Mick), include direction, cessation, modification and correction of a space object and its mission (G.Lafferranderie).53 Meanwhile Art.IX OST prohibits harmful (anything, causing significant harm)54 interference into ongoing space activities without prior consultations on this matter. From our perspective taken in conjunction Art.VIII and Art.IX OST are the basis for declaring violation of space law obligations in a case, when space object is damaged by cyber means or control over it is overtaken: it is interference in space object control, which shall belong to a limited number of states, influencing its activity.\n\nThis approach does not depend on means of infliction of cyber damage by space object, contrary to LIAB proposal. OST model would be the same, if cyber damage had been caused from any facility on the Earth.\n\n53 Commentary (2009) supra note 1, p.157.\n54 Ibid., p.177.",
    "PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SPACE LAW 2020\n\nRecovery of damage to space environment in the light of growing number of space objects gives a floor for one more model of cyber damage recovery. Art.IX OST also contains provision of prohibition of harmful contamination, which form space debris may take.⁵⁵ In our opinion, this construction is secondary in relation to cyber damage to space objects. After establishment and recovery of cyber damage under LIAB or Art.VIII and Art.IX OST, damage to space environment may be recovered as a special category.\n\nWhether damage to space environment shall be broaden to “anticipatory” damage, arising from cyber damage, is subject to further discussions.\n\n## 5.3. Recovery of Cyber Damage on the Basis of General International Law\n\nMeanwhile this does not solve the problem of hijacking, when a state, whose equipment was used for illegal actions, did not commit illegal actions itself. This situation is closely connected to a breach of due diligence obligation – obligation of conduct, arising from a state duty to prevent usage of its territory for unlawful actions.⁵⁶ In the light of cyber damage, inflicted via hijacking of ground or space element, it leads us to proper protection.\n\nDamaging cyber activities directed at space objects are known from 1980s,⁵⁷ thus it is reasonable to expect up-to-date cyber protection on the ground and in space (firewalls, formation of cyber reaction teams, etc.). Since damaging cyber activity is detected, notice on this shall be done and actions taken to cease it, irrespective of their result.⁵⁸ If described above is not done by a state, or organs/persons under its control, a state shall be found responsible for violation of due diligence duty with further compensation for damage.\n\nRecovery of sustained damage is done under general rules of state responsibility.\n\n## 5.4. Recovery of Cyber Damage Under IHL Framework\n\nThere are no doubts that IHL forms a very specific branch of international law, first of all, due to legitimization of use of force.\n\nPeculiarities of armed conflict imply that there is no legal basis for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted to space object – legitimate target.\n\nOn the other hand, in a case of damage to a space object with plurality of launching states, those, who are not party to an armed conflict, may file a claim for recovery of damage under general rules of state responsibility.\n\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n\n⁵⁶ Antonopoulos supra note 5, pp.66-68.\n\n⁵⁷ Mejía-Kaiser supra note 6, p.352.\n\n⁵⁸ Antonopoulos supra note 5, p.69.",
    "SPACE LAW CHALLENGES FOR RECOVERY OF DAMAGE, INFLICTED TO SPACE\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nRecovery of cyber damage is ambiguous question under current space and general international law regulation as reveals lacunas in law and inconsistency of legal norms with existing technologies.\n\nThe answer for provision of adequate legal protection and compensation for sustained damage seems to be in evolutionary interpretation of existing rules and careful understanding of ongoing practice of space activities.\n\nInitially LIAB provides for recovery of direct damage from physical collision with a space object. Later the Convention started to be viewed with an intent to compensate indirect damage as well. Now that it is evident that direct damage may be caused by cyber means without direct collision, what is another step forward for LIAB application.\n\nOST provision of control over space objects may be viewed as the basis for claims of treaty violation, when a space object is damaged by cyber means or is overtaken, with a demand of appropriate compensation.\n\nSituation of an armed conflict justifies use of force against legitimate targets, thus, cyber damage to these space objects cannot be recovered. On the other hand, IHL protection of civilians and civilian objects and simultaneous application of space law treaties leave place for recovery of cyber damage, inflicted illegitimately (damage to civilian objects, use of force against a state not participating in an armed conflict, violation of IHL principles).",

    "abstract": "The paper analyses existing models for recovery of damage, inflicted to space objects, and addresses major challenges, related to cyber damage: the issue of attribution, procedural issues of cyber damage recovery, possibility to recover space damage, inflicted during an armed conflict. A proposal is made to consider cyber damage as direct damage under space law liability regime and evaluate resulting increase of space debris (damage to space environment) for the purposes of compensation amount. Within responsibility for violation of space law obligations cyber damage may be recovered as the result of violation of control over space objects or as harmful interference with space activities. Violation of due diligence obligation to protect space objects (as cyber threats became more vivid) and use of force by cyber means are basis for cyber damage recovery under general international law. Damage to space objects, inflicted during an armed conflict, is recoverable for violation of principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.",
