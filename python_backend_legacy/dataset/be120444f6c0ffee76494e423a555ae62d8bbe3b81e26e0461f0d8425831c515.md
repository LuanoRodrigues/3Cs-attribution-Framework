Putting the 'cyber' back in 'cyberwarfare'\n\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\" (attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s)\nThe purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as:\n- a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online (Green 1981)\n- b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). (Shakarian 2013)\n- c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances (Taddeo 2012).\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption (Clarke 2010)\n- e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles (Arquilla and Ronfeldt 1997)).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of\n375\nKeith Scott\nElectronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm (Fogleman 1995). Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n376\nKeith Scott\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. (Qiao and Wang 2020, Part 1).\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ (Gerasimov 2016). This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ (Rumer 2019);\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West (Galeotti 2016 and 2019);\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW (Moore 2019). However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ (Qiao and Wang 2020, p.189). If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n377\nKeith Scott\ncontractors (McFate 2019b) between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following:\n- i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms (Marks 2020; Safi 2019). Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology (Emanuel et al. 2019; Lin 2012; Royal Society 2012); this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic:\na single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13)\nIf applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines:\nonly if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory (Qiao and Wang 2020: 200-01).\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict\nWhat, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains,\n378\nKeith Scott\nautomatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events:\nMini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create:\nthe perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’ (Cummings 2020a). Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of;\n- the selection, education and training of people for high performance\n- the frontiers of the science of prediction\n- data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management)\n¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\n379\nKeith Scott\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini)\ndecision-making institutions at the apex of government.\n(Cummings 2020b).\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create:\na case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that:\nWar is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989):\nWhether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)",

War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. .\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ . This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ ;\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West ;\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW . However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ . If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n\ncontractors between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following: - i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms. Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology; this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic: a single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13) If applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines: only if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory.\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict What, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains, automatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events: Mini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create: the perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’. Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of; - the selection, education and training of people for high performance - the frontiers of the science of prediction - data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management) ¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\n\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini) decision-making institutions at the apex of government..\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create: a case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that: War is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989): Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)",

    "__preamble__": "Connected, Continual Conflict: Towards a Cybernetic Model of Warfare Keith Scott De Montfort University, Leicester, UK jklscott@dmu.ac.uk DOI: 10.34190/EWS.21.046 Abstract:\"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\"(George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\"(attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s) The purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as: - a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online - b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). - c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption - e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles ).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of Electronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm. Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.",

In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains, automatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.": "There have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events: Mini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create: the perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’. Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of; - the selection, education and training of people for high performance - the frontiers of the science of prediction - data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management) ¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini) decision-making institutions at the apex of government..\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create: a case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that: War is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989): Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)"

They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\"(George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\"(attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s) The purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as: - a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online - b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). - c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption - e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles ).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of Electronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm. Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. .\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ . This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ ;\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West ;\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW . However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ . If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n\ncontractors between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following: - i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms. Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology; this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic: a single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13) If applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines: only if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory.\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict What, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains, automatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events: Mini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create: the perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’. Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of; - the selection, education and training of people for high performance - the frontiers of the science of prediction - data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management) ¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\n\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini) decision-making institutions at the apex of government..\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create: a case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that: War is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989): Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)",

      "flat_text": "Connected, Continual Conflict: Towards a Cybernetic Model of Warfare\nKeith Scott\nDe Montfort University, Leicester, UK\njklscott@dmu.ac.uk\nDOI: 10.34190/EWS.21.046\nAbstract: \"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\" (George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\n1. Putting the 'cyber' back in 'cyberwarfare'\n\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\" (attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s)\nThe purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as:\n- a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online (Green 1981)\n- b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). (Shakarian 2013)\n- c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances (Taddeo 2012).\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption (Clarke 2010)\n- e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles (Arquilla and Ronfeldt 1997)).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of\n375\nKeith Scott\nElectronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm (Fogleman 1995). Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n376\nKeith Scott\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. (Qiao and Wang 2020, Part 1).\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ (Gerasimov 2016). This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ (Rumer 2019);\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West (Galeotti 2016 and 2019);\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW (Moore 2019). However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ (Qiao and Wang 2020, p.189). If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n377\nKeith Scott\ncontractors (McFate 2019b) between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following:\n- i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception.

Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology (Emanuel et al. 2019; Lin 2012; Royal Society 2012); this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic:\na single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons.

Confronting cybernetic conflict\nWhat, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains,\n378\nKeith Scott\nautomatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events:\nMini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create:\nthe perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three.

      "flat_text": "Connected, Continual Conflict: Towards a Cybernetic Model of Warfare\nKeith Scott\nDe Montfort University, Leicester, UK\njklscott@dmu.ac.uk\nDOI: 10.34190/EWS.21.046\nAbstract: \"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\" (George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\n1. Putting the 'cyber' back in 'cyberwarfare'\n\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\" (attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s)\nThe purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as:\n- a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online (Green 1981)\n- b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). (Shakarian 2013)\n- c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances (Taddeo 2012).\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption (Clarke 2010)\n- e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles (Arquilla and Ronfeldt 1997)).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of\n375\nKeith Scott\nElectronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm (Fogleman 1995). Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n376\nKeith Scott\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. (Qiao and Wang 2020, Part 1).\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ (Gerasimov 2016). This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ (Rumer 2019);\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West (Galeotti 2016 and 2019);\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW (Moore 2019). However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ (Qiao and Wang 2020, p.189). If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n377\nKeith Scott\ncontractors (McFate 2019b) between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following:\n- i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms (Marks 2020; Safi 2019). Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology (Emanuel et al. 2019; Lin 2012; Royal Society 2012); this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic:\na single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13)\nIf applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines:\nonly if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory (Qiao and Wang 2020: 200-01).\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict\nWhat, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains,\n378\nKeith Scott\nautomatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events:\nMini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create:\nthe perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred.

They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\"(George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\"(attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s) The purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as: - a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online - b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). - c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption - e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles ).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of Electronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm. Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. .\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ . This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ ;\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West ;\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW . However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ . If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n\ncontractors between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following: - i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms. Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology; this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic: a single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13) If applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines: only if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory.\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict What, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains, automatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events: Mini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create: the perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’. Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of; - the selection, education and training of people for high performance - the frontiers of the science of prediction - data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management) ¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\n\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini) decision-making institutions at the apex of government..\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create: a case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that: War is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989): Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)"

They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\"(George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.\nKeywords: cyber warfare, strategy, hybrid warfare\"Use the word 'cybernetics', Norbert, because nobody knows what it means. This will always put you at an advantage in arguments.\"(attributed to Claude Shannon in letter to Norbert Wiener, ca. 1940s) The purpose of this assembly is to discuss Cyber Warfare and Cyber Security; the purpose of this paper is to argue for a redefinition of these terms, arguing that the word 'Cyber' has become so loose and imprecise in meaning that its use blinds us to a more helpful and productive model for understanding and mitigating the threats posed by new forms of conflict.\nWhat do we mean by 'Cyber Warfare?' There are a multiplicity of possible definitions, which while all covering roughly the same domain, display shades of nuance specific to the concerns of the group or author coining them. Consider the following, which define 'Cyberwarfare' as: - a. interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online - b. an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived). - c. warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\n- d. actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption - e. conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles ).\nThe differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools (essentially a form of Electronic Warfare), while for others, it implies a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry (Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action, this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT- and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm. Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the modern world in general) – connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets, and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.'\n'Cyber' has become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both too vague and too precise; computers are not the important element, rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) – and many of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a cybernetic framework. The reason for this is simple; cybernetics offers a system-based model for understanding the informational network(s) within which Cyber Warfare operates, and it focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these networks of non-human and human elements.\n'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...) than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses 'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis). By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of effective organization'. As such, the adoption of a 'cybernetic mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future conflict seems not only advisable but essential. As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming, autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling within this ambit), the holistic, systems-based worldview offered by cybernetics seems to be unavoidable if we are to stand any chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline, cybernetic military thinking can follow many different paths. on the one hand, we have the more traditional C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear, dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources, forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting formations. The cybernetic perspective, focusing on the network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, is better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges. When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the situation in its totality.\n\n---\n\n## ## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict What, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains, automatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\n\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events: Mini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n[...]\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create: the perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed.

    "Keith Scott\n\n## 2. War everywhere, all the time: Cybernetic conflict\n\nthis kind of war means that all means will be in readiness, that information will be omnipresent, and the battlefield will be everywhere. (Qiao and Wang 2020, Part 1).\n\nThe starting point for grasping the nature of a truly cybernetic warfare is to recognise that ‘warfare’ itself manifests in many forms, both throughout history and in the present. Contemporary conflict can employ ‘traditional’ engagements between large forces of troops and matériel (e.g. the Battle of Medina Ridge during Operation Desert Storm), the use of non-kinetic IT-based ‘ordinance’ (such as STUXNET), the deployment of UAVS for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and targeted strikes, and still have troops fighting hand-to-hand ‘with iron bars, rocks and fists’ (Safi, Ellis-Petersen, and Davidson 2020). The theoretical division between ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ war is, and always has been, illusory. As McFate (2019a) says, ‘[t]here is no such thing as conventional versus unconventional war – there is just war’ (pp. 27-8). The norm is that there is no norm, or that rather, that a new paradigm is in play. It is undeniably true that what has been seen as ‘cyberwarfare’ exists, and has an ever-growing role to play in the battlespace, but this is only one facet of the wider cybernetic model. Previous military theorists, from Sun Tzu through von Clausewitz to Galula and Kitson and beyond, have each focused on one particular martial model; the future of warfare seems likely to privilege those who can think beyond traditional boundaries. The nature of cybernetic warfare is that it is uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted. As Wiener (1980) said, in discussing the desire to divide neat boundaries between disciplines, ‘[t]here is no Maginot Line of the brain’ (p.122.) It is striking that Wiener should make reference to one of the greatest examples of an outmoded military technology; the most interesting work on modern and future conflict comes from those who take a similarly flexible approach. In a key text for understanding this new vision of warfare, Qiao and Wang (2020) dismiss the concept of ‘cyber’ as a discrete domain:\n\n[information technology] is a synthesis of other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. (p.5)\n\nThere will be those who read the preceding and argue that it is merely nothing more than rebranding as ‘cybernetic warfare’ the ideas that have been dubbed the ‘Gerasimov doctrine’ (Gerasimov 2016). This is incorrect, for the following reasons:\n\n- a. Gerasimov did not create a truly new ‘doctrine’, but simply sought to ‘develop an operational concept for Russia’s confrontation with the West in support of the actual doctrine that has guided Russian policy for over two decades: the Primakov doctrine’ (Rumer 2019);\n- b. the idea that Gerasimov’s ideas amount to a revolutionary new model of military thinking has been called into question, not least by one of the writers who initially helped to publicise it in the West (Galeotti 2016 and 2019);\n- c. above all, while the ‘doctrine’ does suggest the use of both ‘conventional’ and ‘unconventional’ methods, and of combining soft and hard power, it does not advance a holistic model for using combined techniques simultaneously; it is not a truly multi-domain model.\n\nI return to the earlier description of cybernetic warfare as ‘uncertain, unbounded, and unrestricted’; these are the key aspects, as outlined below:\n\na. UNCERTAIN: one of the hallmarks of cyber-actions is that attribution for an attack is extremely difficult; online identities can be spoofed or concealed. The online domain offers potential for maskirovka which would be impossible in non-virtual battlespace. As is shown by the fact that the standard term for military deception is Russian, it is no surprise that Russia has been quick to develop informational deception as a tool of IW (Moore 2019). However, it is to be expected that the use of such tactics will become much more widely-used, as a means of low-risk offensive operations, whether as Information Warfare (‘fake news’ is not going to go away) or for attacks on financial markets and critical national infrastructure targets, as well as within a conventional military context. Not only will we be uncertain as to who the attacker is, it is more than likely that we will be unaware that an attack is actually occurring (consider the insertion of malware as part of apparently routine traffic).\n\nb. UNBOUNDED: we should see cybernetic warfare as inextricably linked to the porosity and weakness of traditional boundaries; ‘[i]n a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative’ (Qiao and Wang 2020, p.189). If we examine the West, we can see a collapsing of the barriers between private and public sectors, between military and civilian realms (consider the ever-growing use of private military\n\n377",
    "Keith Scott\n\ncontractors (McFate 2019b) between 'conventional' and 'unconventional' warfare, and, of utmost concern for those concerned with cybernetics, between human and non-human actors. Future conflicts will continue this process of collapse, and we should consider the implications of the following:\n\n- i. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL: The recent UK Ministry of Defence Joint Concept Note on Multi-Domain Integration marks a step change in British military thinking; it does not simply argue that a modern fighting force must be configured to operate in all five domains, but that it should adopt as a fundamental principle the employment of actions which operate across domains. This is of course not an inherently radical concept (consider aerial bombardment of a land target), but the true conceptual shift comes with the embedding of the informational domain within all other domains; we might almost consider that there are not five domains, but an informational domain from which depend and within which operates activity in all the other domains. An informational attack on, for example, a navigational satellite affects not just that asset, but all other networked assets that depend on it; this could lead to the denial of communications, inaccurate targeting data for both human and non-human offensive forces, the disabling of fly by wire systems, and a range of other catastrophic results in land, sea and air forces simultaneously.\n\n- ii. HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION AND CONVERGENCE: Cybernetics, as stated earlier, deals with 'animal and machine'; the modern world in general rests on a network (or network of networks) of human and non-human elements and actors, and the martial realm is no exception. Discussion of the interaction/convergence of human and machine in a military context inevitably leads to fears of two distinct nightmare scenarios. Firstly, machine intelligences achieve full autonomy; see, for example, Slaughterbots. This pseudo-documentary seems all-too plausible, given what is known about ongoing research into autonomous drone swarms (Marks 2020; Safi 2019). Secondly, there is the fear of human augmentation, of combat troops being 'upgraded' and made less human (oddly, cardiac pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements do not raise the same fears), as with the psychopathic half-machine assassin in Warren Ellis' Global Frequency (2003). Again, the imagined future is an extrapolation of current research into augmentation technology (Emanuel et al. 2019; Lin 2012; Royal Society 2012); this can in turn be traced back to one seminal paper, Clynes and Kline's (1960) article which coined the word 'cyborg', derived from 'cybernetic organism'.\n\nc. UNRESTRICTED: 'Unrestricted' does not mean 'unrestrained'; as defined by Qiao and Wang (2020), it signifies a holistic view of conflict, where any part of an enemy's systems (military, political, economic, social...) is a legitimate target, and an 'attack' need not be kinetic:\n\na single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumour or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country's exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. (p. 13)\n\nIf applied as Qiao and Wang suggest, this form of 'warfare' is a truly integrated, network-wide, 'supra-domain' (their term) form of conflict, and it cannot be left solely to the military. A cybernetic warfare is multi- and transdisciplinary, fought across all areas of human activity, in an integrated, interlinked chain of action and result; for this to succeed, it must be devised and governed across traditional managerial and administrative lines:\n\nonly if we break through the various kinds of boundaries in the models of our line of thought, take the various domains which are so completely affected by warfare and turn them into playing cards deftly shuffled in our skilled hands, and thus use beyond-limits strategy and tactics to combine all the resource is of war, can there be the possibility that we will be confident of victory (Qiao and Wang 2020: 200-01).\n\nIn the war that is coming, silos will be for missiles, not thinking.\n\n## 3. Confronting cybernetic conflict\n\nWhat, then, might a truly cybernetic attack look like? And how might it be combatted? In answer to the first question, we cannot yet say in truth; if we consider the classic triad of criminal investigation – motive, means, opportunity – then up until now there have been no shortage of motives for an attack, nor opportunities to launch one (and the multiple overlapping networks of systems of systems, vulnerable SCADA systems, and the Internet of Things have vastly increased the threat surface for on- and offline actions). What has been lacking are the means, or rather the ability to coordinate a range of complex and overlapping actions in real time; the use of AI-driven tools for planning, delivering, and coordinating a range of events across the domains,\n\n378",
    "Keith Scott\n\nautomatically generating commands to the actors and transmitting misinformation to the targets will be a significant threat in the future.\n\nThere have been a plethora of fictional depictions of future war¹, but perhaps the finest initial depiction of what a cybernetic attack might look like is presented in Philip Palmer’s 2012 play *Red and Blue: Terror*. A British brigadier and Bradley Shoreham, a former colonel (who now runs corporate and government-level wargames) discuss various hypothetical ways of destroying London. Shoreham outlines a scenario which combines attacks that have previously occurred with as-yet unreal events:\n\nMini-nuke in Central London – triggers all the protocols. We evacuate. Add sarin in the Tube. Throw in a series of bomb threats on the M25, M1, South Circular, North Circular, and you stymie all attempts at orderly evacuation. Mix in Mumbai-style terrorists in the suburbs; mass panic. Mobs in the street; crush injuries. Rioters throughout London, taking advantage of the sudden and total absence of a police force. A coordinated attack on many fronts. Everything happens at once.\n\n[...]\n\nWest End theatre. A crowded place. Or a cinema, flooded with VX gas. Or leave an anthrax vial in Leicester Square – doesn’t need to be broken, the rumour is enough. You leave the anthrax, then you tweet about it. Panic inevitably ensues. Or inject a rat with botulinum toxin and throw it into the underground system. Set fires in assorted London suburbs; there’s nothing terrifies people so much as a good blaze on the 10 o’clock news. A sniper; shoot a few shoppers on Oxford Street with a military-issue sniper’s rifle, and suddenly the streets will be empty. It’s all about maximising fear.\n\nThe key phrase here is ‘Everything happens at once’; kinetic and non-kinetic events perturb all sectors of the social and informational networks simultaneously. The death toll and fear is merely one aspect of the attack; it generates shockwaves which create:\n\nthe perfect economic, social, political and military storm. A terror attack; the threat of a mini-nuclear bomb in London. [the country at a standstill. The City destabilised. British bonds plummeting in value. Economic meltdown, political meltdown. A Third World War played out in the stock markets. The end of capitalism...\n\nAre we able to combat such an attack? The inability to coordinate an effective response to a single event (the current pandemic) or to combat the informational assaults of Fake News attacks, suggests not. Just as the adoption of a cybernetic approach to warfare requires the adoption of new supra-domain command and control structures, so the effective response to such actions will require root and branch revision of our current security structures. History, sadly, tells us that while such change can occur, it is only after the catastrophe has occurred. There needs to be much closer cooperation between domestic security, intelligence, and military authorities; instead of setting up the much-vaunted ‘Space Force’, the United States would be better occupied establishing an integrated cross-service multi-domain defence force, which can sit within existing structures and pivot into action whenever needed. This of course poses the question of how they will know when and where they are needed, given the number of possible attack points and the amount of data that will require monitoring.\n\nIn the Christmas edition of *The Spectator* last year, Dominic Cummings (the former key adviser to the UK Prime Minister) wrote about Stanislav Petrov, the Russian Officer who refused to notify his superiors that monitoring systems indicated an American nuclear strike was underway. Through his decision, Petrov prevented World War Three. Cummings argues that ‘far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events’ (Cummings 2020a). Cummings is an avowed evangelist for Al-driven analysis of Big Data as an analytical and predictive tool, and has argued that we are neglecting the benefits of working at the intersection of;\n\n- the selection, education and training of people for high performance\n- the frontiers of the science of prediction\n- data science, AI and cognitive technologies (e.g. Seeing Rooms, ‘authoring tools designed for arguing from evidence’, Tetlock/IARPA prediction tournaments that could easily be extended to consider ‘clusters’ of issues around themes like Brexit to improve policy and project management)\n\n¹ See inter alia: Lewis 2018, Singer and Cole 2015, Krepinevich 2010, and the texts listed in Newman and Unsworth 1984.\n\n379",
    "Keith Scott\n\ncommunication (e.g. Cialdini)\ndecision-making institutions at the apex of government.\n\n(Cummings 2020b).\n\n- in short, a technocratic solution to a cybernetic problem. Such an approach will almost inevitably fail; as McFate (2019a) says, of the Pentagon's Project Maven (an attempt to develop AI-led 'algorithmic warfare'), it will create:\n\na case study in modern war ethics and the violation of privacy rights. It would take the guesswork out of the future by sucking in every email, camera feed, broadcast signal, data transmission - everything from everywhere - to know what the world is doing, with the omniscience of a god. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: hubris (p.50).\n\nThe technological superiority of the US Army did not help them defeat the Viet Cong; nor have UAV strikes eradicated Al-Qaeda or ISIS/ISIL. The conflict in Northern Ireland may offer a better example of the approach to take; The IRA were not 'defeated' as such, rather they were outflanked by intelligence gathering, policing, military action, political negotiation and economic investment; a blended approach operating on all fronts simultaneously, covertly and overtly. McFate argues that:\n\nWar is armed politics, and seeking a technical solution to a political problem is folly. Ultimately, brainpower is superior to firepower, and we should invest in people, not platforms. (p.57).\n\n- he is right, but he is only partially right. It should be remembered that cybernetics is concerned with the 'animal and the machine'; only a blended approach can truly hope to combat the supra-domain threats we face. Consider in closing an example taken from law enforcement; automated facial recognition is, as we know, inaccurate and prone to serious flaws when observing people of colour, reflecting the way in which an algorithmic system will always reflect and magnify the biases of the society in which it is created. No AI-based system can match the abilities of human 'super-recognisers' (Bobak et al 2019; Moshakis 2018), but humans tire; the future must lie in a properly-constructed machine learning and human-machine teaming to create an effective and accurate 'always-on' recognition system, which is always overseen by humans. When Cummings praises Petrov while simultaneously calling for a greater use of AI, he forgets that his hero is a perfect example of a human intelligence rejecting the opinion of a machine intelligence. A truly cybernetic approach recognises that what matters is neither human nor machine intelligence per se, but intelligence pure and simple. To return to the foundations of the discipline, we must be guided by Wiener (1989):\n\nWhether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions (p. 185-6)\n\n# References\n\nAmpère, A-M.

    "abstract": "\"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.\" (George W. Bush) The purpose of this paper is to argue that to see 'cyber warfare' as a discrete form of combat, or as merely a combination of Electronic and Information Warfare, is a fundamental error. We must see 'cyber' as shorthand for 'cyberNETIC', and cyber warfare as a form of conflict which operates across all domains, and where action in one domain inevitably influences other zones of conflict. The UK military is seeking to reshape itself according to the concept of Integrated Operating, and this paper contends that such a model is essential. Marshall McLuhan defined World War 3 as 'a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation'; a cybernetic conflict is infinitely more complex, erasing the boundaries between kinetic and non-kinetic warfare, between civilian and military, and indeed between peace and war themselves. The paper will consider a scenario demonstrating what such a multi-domain conflict might be like, considering the use of non-human combatants operating in cooperation and against human forces, and the impossibility of maintaining a clear division between 'war' and 'operations other than war'. Ultimately, it will contend that the current structures of military forces are too rigid and rooted in earlier eras of warfare to allow us to respond effectively to the conflicts that await us in the all-too-near future. Norbert Wiener sought to avoid applying his knowledge of cybernetics to the military domain; this paper argues that it must be done. It is, in short, the most useful theoretical framework for waging hybrid, non-linear warfare.",
