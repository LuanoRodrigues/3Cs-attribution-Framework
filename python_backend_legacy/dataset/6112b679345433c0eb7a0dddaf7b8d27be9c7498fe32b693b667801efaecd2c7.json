A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\n\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n\n$^{573}$ LL.M.

Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\n\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n\n574 Daniel T Kuehl, ‘From cyberspace to cyberpower: Defining the problem’ in Franklin D Kramer et al, *Cyberpower and National Security* (National Defense University Press: Washington DC, 2009), p. 28.\n\n575 ‘Cyberspace’ was coined in a science fiction novel; William Gibson, *Neuromancer* (Ace Books: New York, 1984).\n\n576 Alexander Graham Bell is widely regarded as making the first telephone call on 10 March 1876 see, Michael E Gorman, ‘Confirmation, disconfirmation, and invention: The case of Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone’ (1995) 1 Thinking &amp; Reasoning 31, p. 45.\n\n577 The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.

As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level.⁵⁹¹ As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced.

Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda.⁵⁹⁵ The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching.⁵⁹⁶ However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations.⁵⁹⁷ Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation.

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\n\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\n\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n\n126</https:>",

Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform.⁶⁰² With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.⁶⁰³\n\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law.⁶⁰⁴ Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\n\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606]\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security.

The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud,⁶¹⁰ offences related to child pornography,⁶¹¹ and copyright violations.⁶¹² Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law.⁶¹³ Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\n\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction.⁶¹⁷ It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales,⁶¹⁸ all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco.⁶¹⁹ He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment.⁶²⁰ The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\n\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website.

For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace.⁶³⁶ As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space.⁶³⁷ Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’.⁶⁴¹ Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\n\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them.

Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state.⁶⁴⁸ Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued.

This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\n\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication.

The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\n\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force.⁶⁷³ The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\n\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however.⁶⁸⁰ If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school.⁶⁸¹ This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.⁶⁸²\n\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter,⁶⁸³ there are attributional issues that must be overcome.

If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor.

The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH),⁶⁹⁶ through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\n\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I,⁶⁹⁷ addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons,⁶⁹⁸ or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces,⁶⁹⁹ then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.⁷⁰⁰\n\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare.

Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself.⁷⁰² We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction.⁷⁰³ This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict.

This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces.⁷⁰⁵ Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character.

As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them.

The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n$^{573}$ LL.M.

Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n574 Daniel T Kuehl, ‘From cyberspace to cyberpower: Defining the problem’ in Franklin D Kramer et al, *Cyberpower and National Security* (National Defense University Press: Washington DC, 2009), p. 28.\n575 ‘Cyberspace’ was coined in a science fiction novel; William Gibson, *Neuromancer* (Ace Books: New York, 1984).\n576 Alexander Graham Bell is widely regarded as making the first telephone call on 10 March 1876 see, Michael E Gorman, ‘Confirmation, disconfirmation, and invention: The case of Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone’ (1995) 1 Thinking &amp; Reasoning 31, p. 45.\n577 The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.

Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^[579]^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^[580]^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^[581]^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^[582]^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^[583]^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^[584]^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today. This reorganisation lead to three sectors of focus: Radiocommunication (ITU-R); Standardisation (ITU-T); and Development (ITU-D).^[585]^\n^[579]^ International Telecommunication Union, ‘Statistics’, available online at, <http: etu=\"\" itud=\"\" itu-d=\"\" statistics=\"\" pages=\"\" stat=\"\" default.aspx=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed on 7 April 2016.\n^[580]^ United Nations, ‘World Population Prospects 2015’ Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, estimates for 2015 available to download online from, <http: download=\"\" esaa.un.org=\"\" population=\"\" unpd=\"\" standard=\"\"></http:> accessed 27 April 2016.\n^[581]^ Although generally used in the context of warfare, this “fifth domain” can also be applied generally.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations.⁵⁸⁶ Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”⁵⁸⁷\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003⁵⁸⁸ and Tunis in 2005⁵⁸⁹ – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge.⁵⁹⁰ Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level.⁵⁹¹ As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints. Certain agreements, such as the 2009 Agreement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,⁵⁹² in which\n⁵⁸⁶ International Telecommunication Union (n 584).\n⁵⁸⁷ ibid.\n⁵⁸⁸ Resulting in, World Summit on the Information Society, Declaration of Principles.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online.⁵⁹³ The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988,⁵⁹⁴ the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda.⁵⁹⁵ The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching.⁵⁹⁶ However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations.⁵⁹⁷ Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it,\n⁵⁹³ David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nOpen source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace. Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform.⁶⁰² With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.⁶⁰³\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law.⁶⁰⁴ Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world. Although we will first deal with civilian\n⁶⁰² Steven Weber, *The Success of Open Source* (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2004).\n⁶⁰³ Greg Madey et al, ‘The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An Analysis Based on Social Network Theory’ (2002) Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 1806.\n⁶⁰⁴ For more on Soft Organisations in international law see, Jan Klabbers, ‘Institutional Ambivalence by Design: Soft Organizations in International Law’ (2001) 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 403.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat  $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.[608]\n[605] Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud,⁶¹⁰ offences related to child pornography,⁶¹¹ and copyright violations.⁶¹² Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law.⁶¹³ Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’).⁶¹⁴ The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access.⁶¹⁵ As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.⁶¹⁶ As with much of the\n⁶⁰⁹ Council of Europe Convention for Cybercrime (adopted 23 November 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) ETS 185 (Hereinafter Convention for Cybercrime).\n⁶¹⁰ ibid, Article 8.\n⁶¹¹ ibid, Article 9.\n⁶¹² ibid, Article 10.\n⁶¹³ For example, in the United Kingdom, it came into force through, Convention for Cybercrime (1 September 2011) Treaty Series No. 18 (2012) Cmnd 3809.\n⁶¹⁴ Hsinchun Chen, Dark Web: Exploring and Data Mining the Dark Side of the Web (Springer: New York 2012).\n⁶¹⁵ Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and Paul Syverson, ‘Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router’ (2004) Washington DC: US Naval Research Lab.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction.⁶¹⁷ It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales,⁶¹⁸ all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco.⁶¹⁹ He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment.⁶²⁰ The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany,⁶²¹ but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road,⁶²² that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross\n⁶¹⁷ Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence.⁶²³ Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).⁶²⁴ If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’.⁶²⁵ For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.⁶²⁶\nWe have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook⁶²⁷ and Twitter⁶²⁸ can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level.

Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved.⁶³⁵ We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n⁶²⁹ Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\" uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³⁰ Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" darkhotel-malware=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³¹ Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\" 2015=\"\" 26=\"\" ashley-madison-hack=\"\" fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n⁶³² For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\" security=\"\" article.php=\"\" rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\" www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n⁶³³ Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace.⁶³⁶ As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space.⁶³⁷ Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’.⁶⁴¹ Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict.⁶⁴² In short, a major issue facing international law is\n⁶³⁶ n. 581 (Maogoto, 2014), p. 53.

Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online.⁶⁴⁷ Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state.⁶⁴⁸ Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia\n⁶⁴³ Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n⁶⁴⁴ The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.⁶⁵¹\nAlthough there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians.⁶⁵² As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack.⁶⁵³ In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made.⁶⁵⁴ Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack.⁶⁵⁵ On the other hand, as this area of law is clearly in its infancy, the international response may be more subdued and restrained.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive.⁶⁵⁶ Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state.⁶⁵⁷ Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted.⁶⁵⁸ As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia.⁶⁵⁹ This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack.⁶⁶⁰ ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system.⁶⁶¹ The Conficker Worm again illustrates the issue of attribution. It is still unclear who is, or was, behind the creation of the Worm.⁶⁶² This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace.

In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^[663]^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^[664]^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^[667]^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today.

Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom,⁶⁷² faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands.

The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force.⁶⁷³ The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology.⁶⁷⁴ If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.⁶⁷⁵\n⁶⁷³ Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.⁶⁷⁸\nThe threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order.⁶⁷⁹ This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered\n⁶⁷⁶ Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69. The US have also said they will react militarily to cyber-attacks see, Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’ (2002) *Computerworld*, available online at, <http: 2579191=\"\" article=\"\" cybercrime-hacking=\"\" prospect-of-iraq-conflict-raises-new-cyberattack-fears.html=\"\" www.computerworld.com=\"\"> accessed 20 April 2016.\n⁶⁷⁷ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep, p.226 (Hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), para. 39.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however.⁶⁸⁰ If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school.⁶⁸¹ This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.⁶⁸²\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter,⁶⁸³ there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution.⁶⁸⁴ Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.⁶⁸⁵\nIncreasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online.⁶⁸⁶ Other groups which actually embody\n⁶⁸⁰ n. 663 (Roscini, 2015), p. 236.\n⁶⁸¹ Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n⁶⁸² It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012), p. 232.\n⁶⁸³ n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n⁶⁸⁴ n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012).\n⁶⁸⁵ ibid, p. 234.\n⁶⁸⁶ For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State.

In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules.⁶⁸⁸ In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks.⁶⁸⁹ This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met.⁶⁹⁰ With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford.

If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied.⁶⁹² Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law.⁶⁹³ This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.”⁶⁹⁴ We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n⁶⁹¹ Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n⁶⁹² Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2).

The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH),⁶⁹⁶ through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I,⁶⁹⁷ addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons,⁶⁹⁸ or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces,⁶⁹⁹ then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.⁷⁰⁰\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual).⁷⁰¹ The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to\n⁶⁹⁵ n. 670 (Schmitt, 2002), p. 373.\n⁶⁹⁶ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n⁶⁹⁷ ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n⁶⁹⁸ Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n⁶⁹⁹ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n⁷⁰⁰ Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n⁷⁰¹ n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\ncyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself.⁷⁰² We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction.⁷⁰³ This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them.⁷⁰⁴ Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces.⁷⁰⁵ Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences.⁷⁰⁶ This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in\n⁷⁰² David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n⁷⁰³ n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78.

When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n707 n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(4).

Conclusion\nThe future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n$^{573}$ LL.M.

Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n\n# I. Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^[579]^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^[580]^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^[581]^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^[582]^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^[583]^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^[584]^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today. This reorganisation lead to three sectors of focus: Radiocommunication (ITU-R); Standardisation (ITU-T); and Development (ITU-D).^[585]^\n^[579]^ International Telecommunication Union, ‘Statistics’, available online at, <http: etu=\"\" itud=\"\" itu-d=\"\" statistics=\"\" pages=\"\" stat=\"\" default.aspx=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed on 7 April 2016.\n^[580]^ United Nations, ‘World Population Prospects 2015’ Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, estimates for 2015 available to download online from, <http: download=\"\" esaa.un.org=\"\" population=\"\" unpd=\"\" standard=\"\"></http:> accessed 27 April 2016.\n^[581]^ Although generally used in the context of warfare, this “fifth domain” can also be applied generally.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations. Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005 – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge. Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level. As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online. The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988, the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda. The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching. However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations. Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it,\n David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nOpen source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace. Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform. With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law. Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world. Although we will first deal with civilian\n Steven Weber, *The Success of Open Source* (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2004).\n Greg Madey et al, ‘The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An Analysis Based on Social Network Theory’ (2002) Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 1806.\n For more on Soft Organisations in international law see, Jan Klabbers, ‘Institutional Ambivalence by Design: Soft Organizations in International Law’ (2001) 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 403.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat  $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.[608]\n[605] Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

It was a landmark in that it was the first multilateral treaty directly concerned with crimes committed online. The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud, offences related to child pornography, and copyright violations. Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law. Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’). The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access. As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction. It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales, all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco. He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment. The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany, but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road, that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross\n Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence. Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’. For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.\nWe have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level.

Attacks have also occurred on high street banks, software downloaded from the internet, and on credit card payment systems. As stated above, the security in place for such attacks is developed on a reactive basis. Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved. We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\" uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" darkhotel-malware=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\" 2015=\"\" 26=\"\" ashley-madison-hack=\"\" fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\" security=\"\" article.php=\"\" rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\" www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace. As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space. Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’. Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict. In short, a major issue facing international law is\n n. 581 (Maogoto, 2014), p. 53. See also, Toby L Friesen, ‘Resolving Tomorrow’s Conflicts Today: How New Developments Within the U.N.

Generally, and historically, this has been considered to be the use of physical force, such as invasions or the use of physical weaponry against other States, outside the confines of an armed conflict. Indeed, with the use of force in the physical world, States have an “inherent” right to self-defence. If cyber-attacks are to be viewed in the same vein as kinetic attacks, the question of whether self-defence can be invoked becomes relevant.\nEstonia, with its 1.3 million inhabitants, is one of the most technologically connected nations in the world today. Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online. Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state. Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia\n Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

The first wave was less sophisticated than the second, which used large ‘botnets’ of compromised computers to launch many DDoS attacks against the state. This resulted in much of the technological functioning of the state coming to a standstill. Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.\nAlthough there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians. As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack. In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made. Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack. On the other hand, as this area of law is clearly in its infancy, the international response may be more subdued and restrained.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive. Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state. Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted. As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia. This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack. ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system. The Conficker Worm again illustrates the issue of attribution. It is still unclear who is, or was, behind the creation of the Worm. This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace.

In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^[663]^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^[664]^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^[667]^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today.

In stark contrast, the internet has only been available for public consumption since the latter half of the 20th century. This relates to the ‘Revolution in Military Affairs’ (RMA) the world is currently witnessing, in which a transformation in the way opposing sides are conducting wartime activities is taking place. Indeed, major States including the US, the UK, and China, now have dedicated cyber commands embedded within their military.\nIt is certainly a very telling time for international law. Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom, faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands. As the world scratches its head over the response to such events, the\n Jared Diamond, *Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of everybody for the last 13,000 years* (Vintage Books: London, 1998), p. 253.

The proposition of ‘instant’ custom has been made see, Bin Cheng, ‘United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: “Instant” International Customary Law?” (1965) 5 Indian Journal of International Law 23, but this is generally rejected.\n\nshady area of little to no regulation is being evidenced by viruses and worms such as Stuxnet. The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force. The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology. If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.\n Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

Strong and intimidating rhetoric indeed, and whilst sounding slightly preposterous that this would genuinely come into consideration, it signifies the attitude towards such attacks, the paranoia surrounding them, and the severity with which they are being treated.\nIndeed, the case can be made that the issue at hand does not concern the weapons used to administer force on a target, but the actual force that is administered. From this consequentialist perspective, if it can be ascertained that the effect of a cyber-attack amounts to the use of force, then the international frameworks already in place can be applied to such situations. What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.\nThe threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order. This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered\n Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69. The US have also said they will react militarily to cyber-attacks see, Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’ (2002) *Computerworld*, available online at, <http: 2579191=\"\" article=\"\" cybercrime-hacking=\"\" prospect-of-iraq-conflict-raises-new-cyberattack-fears.html=\"\" www.computerworld.com=\"\"> accessed 20 April 2016.\n *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep, p.226 (Hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), para. 39.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however. If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school. This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter, there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution. Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.\nIncreasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online. Other groups which actually embody\n n. 663 (Roscini, 2015), p. 236.\n Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012), p. 232.\n n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012).\n ibid, p. 234.\n For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State. See, Alex Hern, ‘Anonymous “at war” with Isis, hacktivist group confirms’, *The Guardian* (London 17 November 2015),\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nthe ‘anonymous’ moniker are suspected of working with, or on the behest of, states to launch cyber-attacks. Such actions engage the rules on state responsibility. In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules. In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks. This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met. With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford. Such actions in self-defence,\navailable online at, <https: 17=\"\" 2015=\"\" anonymous-war-isis-hacktivist-group-confirms=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 15 April 2016.\n Although this cannot be conclusively confirmed due to attributional issues, attacks such as ‘Turla’ and ‘DarkSeoul’ have been linked to states working through non-state actors.

As such, a general test for attribution based on a principle such as on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could be a solution. If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied. Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law. This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.” We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2). The Martens Clause first appeared in, Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 29 July 1899, entered into force 4 September 1900) 187 CTS 429 (Hereinafter Hague Convention II 1899), Preamble.\n Jean d’Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (forthcoming) ACIL Research Paper 2016-11, <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"2765408\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 25 April 2016, p. 3.\n ibid.\n143</http:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nAt a basic level, an armed conflict exists when a group acts towards a common goal of injuring, killing, or destroying an opposition. If a cyber-based attack is intended to cause any of those end results in the physical world, it is well-settled that it should be considered a use of force. The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH), through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I, addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons, or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces, then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual). The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to\n n. 670 (Schmitt, 2002), p. 373.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\ncyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself. We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction. This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them. Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces. Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences. This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in\n David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78. See also, n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 48. See also n. 698 (ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 1.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(2).\n For example, see, ibid (Additional Protocol I), Articles 52, 54 and 56. The aforementioned Stuxnet attack could have potentially led to the release of ‘dangerous forces’, for example.\n n. 671 (Andress and Winterfeld, 2013), p. 58-9. See also Calvery Bowers, ‘A Plan for SCADA Security to deter DoS Attacks’ (2005) in Calvery Bowers et al, s.1 Proceedings of the Department of Homeland Security, R&amp;D Partnering Conference.\n\ncyberspace has the potential of becoming indiscriminate and as such violating one of the main tenets of the LOAC.707\nThe law applicable to cyber warfare faces further challenges when principles such as proportionality are considered. When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n\n146</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\n## III. Conclusion\nThe future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n$^{573}$ LL.M. Candidate, The University of Manchester, School of Law.\n\nclarity. This is particularly evident in cases of cyber warfare. Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n\n# I. Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^[579]^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^[580]^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^[581]^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^[582]^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^[583]^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^[584]^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today. This reorganisation lead to three sectors of focus: Radiocommunication (ITU-R); Standardisation (ITU-T); and Development (ITU-D).^[585]^\n^[579]^ International Telecommunication Union, ‘Statistics’, available online at, <http: etu=\"\" itud=\"\" itu-d=\"\" statistics=\"\" pages=\"\" stat=\"\" default.aspx=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed on 7 April 2016.\n^[580]^ United Nations, ‘World Population Prospects 2015’ Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, estimates for 2015 available to download online from, <http: download=\"\" esaa.un.org=\"\" population=\"\" unpd=\"\" standard=\"\"></http:> accessed 27 April 2016.\n^[581]^ Although generally used in the context of warfare, this “fifth domain” can also be applied generally.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations. Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005 – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge. Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level. As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online. The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988, the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda. The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching. However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations. Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it,\n David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nOpen source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace.

The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform. With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law. Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat  $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.[608]\n[605] Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

It was a landmark in that it was the first multilateral treaty directly concerned with crimes committed online. The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud, offences related to child pornography, and copyright violations. Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law. Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’). The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access. As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction. It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales, all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco. He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment. The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany, but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road, that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross\n Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence. Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’. For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.\nWe have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level. Recent history provides a wealth of examples in which this has occurred. Across 2014 and 2015 alone,\n Constitution of the United States, Amendment IV.\n n. 591, UDHR, Article 12.

Attacks have also occurred on high street banks, software downloaded from the internet, and on credit card payment systems. As stated above, the security in place for such attacks is developed on a reactive basis. Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved. We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\" uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" darkhotel-malware=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\" 2015=\"\" 26=\"\" ashley-madison-hack=\"\" fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\" security=\"\" article.php=\"\" rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\" www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace. As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space. Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’. Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict. In short, a major issue facing international law is\n n. 581 (Maogoto, 2014), p. 53. See also, Toby L Friesen, ‘Resolving Tomorrow’s Conflicts Today: How New Developments Within the U.N.

Generally, and historically, this has been considered to be the use of physical force, such as invasions or the use of physical weaponry against other States, outside the confines of an armed conflict. Indeed, with the use of force in the physical world, States have an “inherent” right to self-defence. If cyber-attacks are to be viewed in the same vein as kinetic attacks, the question of whether self-defence can be invoked becomes relevant.\nEstonia, with its 1.3 million inhabitants, is one of the most technologically connected nations in the world today. Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online. Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state. Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia\n Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

The first wave was less sophisticated than the second, which used large ‘botnets’ of compromised computers to launch many DDoS attacks against the state. This resulted in much of the technological functioning of the state coming to a standstill. Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.\nAlthough there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians. As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack. In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made. Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive. Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state. Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted. As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia. This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack. ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system. The Conficker Worm again illustrates the issue of attribution. It is still unclear who is, or was, behind the creation of the Worm. This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace.

In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^[663]^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^[664]^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^[667]^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today.

In stark contrast, the internet has only been available for public consumption since the latter half of the 20th century. This relates to the ‘Revolution in Military Affairs’ (RMA) the world is currently witnessing, in which a transformation in the way opposing sides are conducting wartime activities is taking place. Indeed, major States including the US, the UK, and China, now have dedicated cyber commands embedded within their military.\nIt is certainly a very telling time for international law. Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom, faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands. As the world scratches its head over the response to such events, the\n Jared Diamond, *Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of everybody for the last 13,000 years* (Vintage Books: London, 1998), p. 253.

The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force. The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology. If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.\n Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

Strong and intimidating rhetoric indeed, and whilst sounding slightly preposterous that this would genuinely come into consideration, it signifies the attitude towards such attacks, the paranoia surrounding them, and the severity with which they are being treated.\nIndeed, the case can be made that the issue at hand does not concern the weapons used to administer force on a target, but the actual force that is administered. From this consequentialist perspective, if it can be ascertained that the effect of a cyber-attack amounts to the use of force, then the international frameworks already in place can be applied to such situations. What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.\nThe threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order. This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered\n Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69. The US have also said they will react militarily to cyber-attacks see, Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’ (2002) *Computerworld*, available online at, <http: 2579191=\"\" article=\"\" cybercrime-hacking=\"\" prospect-of-iraq-conflict-raises-new-cyberattack-fears.html=\"\" www.computerworld.com=\"\"> accessed 20 April 2016.\n *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep, p.226 (Hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), para. 39.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however. If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school. This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter, there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution. Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.\nIncreasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online. Other groups which actually embody\n n. 663 (Roscini, 2015), p. 236.\n Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012), p. 232.\n n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012).\n ibid, p. 234.\n For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State. See, Alex Hern, ‘Anonymous “at war” with Isis, hacktivist group confirms’, *The Guardian* (London 17 November 2015),\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nthe ‘anonymous’ moniker are suspected of working with, or on the behest of, states to launch cyber-attacks. Such actions engage the rules on state responsibility. In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules. In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks. This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met. With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford. Such actions in self-defence,\navailable online at, <https: 17=\"\" 2015=\"\" anonymous-war-isis-hacktivist-group-confirms=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 15 April 2016.\n Although this cannot be conclusively confirmed due to attributional issues, attacks such as ‘Turla’ and ‘DarkSeoul’ have been linked to states working through non-state actors.

As such, a general test for attribution based on a principle such as on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could be a solution. If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied. Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law. This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.” We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2). The Martens Clause first appeared in, Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 29 July 1899, entered into force 4 September 1900) 187 CTS 429 (Hereinafter Hague Convention II 1899), Preamble.\n Jean d’Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (forthcoming) ACIL Research Paper 2016-11, <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"2765408\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 25 April 2016, p. 3.\n ibid.\n143</http:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nAt a basic level, an armed conflict exists when a group acts towards a common goal of injuring, killing, or destroying an opposition. If a cyber-based attack is intended to cause any of those end results in the physical world, it is well-settled that it should be considered a use of force. The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH), through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I, addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons, or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces, then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual). The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to\n n. 670 (Schmitt, 2002), p. 373.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\ncyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself. We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction. This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them. Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces. Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences. This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in\n David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78. See also, n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 48. See also n. 698 (ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 1.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(2).\n For example, see, ibid (Additional Protocol I), Articles 52, 54 and 56. The aforementioned Stuxnet attack could have potentially led to the release of ‘dangerous forces’, for example.\n n. 671 (Andress and Winterfeld, 2013), p. 58-9. See also Calvery Bowers, ‘A Plan for SCADA Security to deter DoS Attacks’ (2005) in Calvery Bowers et al, s.1 Proceedings of the Department of Homeland Security, R&amp;D Partnering Conference.\n\ncyberspace has the potential of becoming indiscriminate and as such violating one of the main tenets of the LOAC.707\nThe law applicable to cyber warfare faces further challenges when principles such as proportionality are considered. When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n\n146</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\n## III. Conclusion\nThe future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n$^{573}$ LL.M. Candidate, The University of Manchester, School of Law.\n\nclarity. This is particularly evident in cases of cyber warfare. Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n\n# I. Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^[579]^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^[580]^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^[581]^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^[582]^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^[583]^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^[584]^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today. This reorganisation lead to three sectors of focus: Radiocommunication (ITU-R); Standardisation (ITU-T); and Development (ITU-D).^[585]^\n^[579]^ International Telecommunication Union, ‘Statistics’, available online at, <http: etu=\"\" itud=\"\" itu-d=\"\" statistics=\"\" pages=\"\" stat=\"\" default.aspx=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed on 7 April 2016.\n^[580]^ United Nations, ‘World Population Prospects 2015’ Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, estimates for 2015 available to download online from, <http: download=\"\" esaa.un.org=\"\" population=\"\" unpd=\"\" standard=\"\"></http:> accessed 27 April 2016.\n^[581]^ Although generally used in the context of warfare, this “fifth domain” can also be applied generally.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations. Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005 – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge. Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level. As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online. The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988, the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda. The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching. However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations. Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it,\n David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nOpen source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace. Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform. With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law. Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world. Although we will first deal with civilian\n Steven Weber, *The Success of Open Source* (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2004).\n Greg Madey et al, ‘The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An Analysis Based on Social Network Theory’ (2002) Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 1806.\n For more on Soft Organisations in international law see, Jan Klabbers, ‘Institutional Ambivalence by Design: Soft Organizations in International Law’ (2001) 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 403.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat  $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.[608]\n[605] Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

It was a landmark in that it was the first multilateral treaty directly concerned with crimes committed online. The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud, offences related to child pornography, and copyright violations. Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law. Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’). The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access. As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction. It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales, all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco. He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment. The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany, but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road, that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross\n Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence. Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’. For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.\nWe have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level. Recent history provides a wealth of examples in which this has occurred. Across 2014 and 2015 alone,\n Constitution of the United States, Amendment IV.\n n. 591, UDHR, Article 12.

Attacks have also occurred on high street banks, software downloaded from the internet, and on credit card payment systems. As stated above, the security in place for such attacks is developed on a reactive basis. Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved. We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\" uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" darkhotel-malware=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\" 2015=\"\" 26=\"\" ashley-madison-hack=\"\" fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\" security=\"\" article.php=\"\" rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\" www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace. As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space. Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’. Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict. In short, a major issue facing international law is\n n. 581 (Maogoto, 2014), p. 53. See also, Toby L Friesen, ‘Resolving Tomorrow’s Conflicts Today: How New Developments Within the U.N.

Generally, and historically, this has been considered to be the use of physical force, such as invasions or the use of physical weaponry against other States, outside the confines of an armed conflict. Indeed, with the use of force in the physical world, States have an “inherent” right to self-defence. If cyber-attacks are to be viewed in the same vein as kinetic attacks, the question of whether self-defence can be invoked becomes relevant.\nEstonia, with its 1.3 million inhabitants, is one of the most technologically connected nations in the world today. Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online. Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state. Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia\n Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

The first wave was less sophisticated than the second, which used large ‘botnets’ of compromised computers to launch many DDoS attacks against the state. This resulted in much of the technological functioning of the state coming to a standstill. Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.\nAlthough there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians. As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack. In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made. Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack. On the other hand, as this area of law is clearly in its infancy, the international response may be more subdued and restrained.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive. Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state. Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted. As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia. This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack. ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system.

This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace.

In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^[663]^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^[664]^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^[667]^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today.

In stark contrast, the internet has only been available for public consumption since the latter half of the 20th century. This relates to the ‘Revolution in Military Affairs’ (RMA) the world is currently witnessing, in which a transformation in the way opposing sides are conducting wartime activities is taking place. Indeed, major States including the US, the UK, and China, now have dedicated cyber commands embedded within their military.\nIt is certainly a very telling time for international law. Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom, faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands. As the world scratches its head over the response to such events, the\n Jared Diamond, *Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of everybody for the last 13,000 years* (Vintage Books: London, 1998), p. 253.

The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force. The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology. If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.\n Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

Strong and intimidating rhetoric indeed, and whilst sounding slightly preposterous that this would genuinely come into consideration, it signifies the attitude towards such attacks, the paranoia surrounding them, and the severity with which they are being treated.\nIndeed, the case can be made that the issue at hand does not concern the weapons used to administer force on a target, but the actual force that is administered. From this consequentialist perspective, if it can be ascertained that the effect of a cyber-attack amounts to the use of force, then the international frameworks already in place can be applied to such situations. What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.\nThe threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order. This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered\n Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however. If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school. This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter, there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution. Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.\nIncreasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online. Other groups which actually embody\n n. 663 (Roscini, 2015), p. 236.\n Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012), p. 232.\n n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012).\n ibid, p. 234.\n For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State.

Such actions engage the rules on state responsibility. In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules. In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks. This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met. With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford. Such actions in self-defence,\navailable online at, <https: 17=\"\" 2015=\"\" anonymous-war-isis-hacktivist-group-confirms=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 15 April 2016.\n Although this cannot be conclusively confirmed due to attributional issues, attacks such as ‘Turla’ and ‘DarkSeoul’ have been linked to states working through non-state actors.

As such, a general test for attribution based on a principle such as on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could be a solution. If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied. Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law. This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.” We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2).

If a cyber-based attack is intended to cause any of those end results in the physical world, it is well-settled that it should be considered a use of force. The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH), through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I, addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons, or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces, then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual). The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to\n n. 670 (Schmitt, 2002), p. 373.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\ncyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself. We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction. This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them. Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces. Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences. This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in\n David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78. See also, n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 48. See also n. 698 (ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 1.\n n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(2).\n For example, see, ibid (Additional Protocol I), Articles 52, 54 and 56. The aforementioned Stuxnet attack could have potentially led to the release of ‘dangerous forces’, for example.\n n. 671 (Andress and Winterfeld, 2013), p. 58-9. See also Calvery Bowers, ‘A Plan for SCADA Security to deter DoS Attacks’ (2005) in Calvery Bowers et al, s.1 Proceedings of the Department of Homeland Security, R&amp;D Partnering Conference.\n\ncyberspace has the potential of becoming indiscriminate and as such violating one of the main tenets of the LOAC.707\nThe law applicable to cyber warfare faces further challenges when principles such as proportionality are considered. When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n\n146</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\n## III. Conclusion\nThe future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack\n$^{573}$ LL.M. Candidate, The University of Manchester, School of Law.\n121\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nclarity. This is particularly evident in cases of cyber warfare. Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n574 Daniel T Kuehl, ‘From cyberspace to cyberpower: Defining the problem’ in Franklin D Kramer et al, *Cyberpower and National Security* (National Defense University Press: Washington DC, 2009), p. 28.\n575 ‘Cyberspace’ was coined in a science fiction novel; William Gibson, *Neuromancer* (Ace Books: New York, 1984).\n576 Alexander Graham Bell is widely regarded as making the first telephone call on 10 March 1876 see, Michael E Gorman, ‘Confirmation, disconfirmation, and invention: The case of Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone’ (1995) 1 Thinking &amp; Reasoning 31, p. 45.\n577 The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.

Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations.⁵⁸⁶ Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”⁵⁸⁷\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003⁵⁸⁸ and Tunis in 2005⁵⁸⁹ – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge.⁵⁹⁰ Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level.⁵⁹¹ As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online.⁵⁹³ The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988,⁵⁹⁴ the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda.⁵⁹⁵ The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching.⁵⁹⁶ However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations.⁵⁹⁷ Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it,\n⁵⁹³ David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). $^{599}$ Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. $^{600}$ ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. $^{601}$\n$^{598}$ Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n$^{599}$ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\" pages=\"\" resources=\"\" what-2012-02-25-en=\"\" www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n$^{600}$ ibid.\n$^{601}$ Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nOpen source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace. Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform.⁶⁰² With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.⁶⁰³\nAs mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law.⁶⁰⁴ Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world. Although we will first deal with civilian\n⁶⁰² Steven Weber, *The Success of Open Source* (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2004).\n⁶⁰³ Greg Madey et al, ‘The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An Analysis Based on Social Network Theory’ (2002) Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 1806.\n⁶⁰⁴ For more on Soft Organisations in international law see, Jan Klabbers, ‘Institutional Ambivalence by Design: Soft Organizations in International Law’ (2001) 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 403.

Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful. This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage). When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat  $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.\n Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud,⁶¹⁰ offences related to child pornography,⁶¹¹ and copyright violations.⁶¹² Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law.⁶¹³ Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’).⁶¹⁴ The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access.⁶¹⁵ As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.⁶¹⁶ As with much of the\n⁶⁰⁹ Council of Europe Convention for Cybercrime (adopted 23 November 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) ETS 185 (Hereinafter Convention for Cybercrime).\n⁶¹⁰ ibid, Article 8.\n⁶¹¹ ibid, Article 9.\n⁶¹² ibid, Article 10.\n⁶¹³ For example, in the United Kingdom, it came into force through, Convention for Cybercrime (1 September 2011) Treaty Series No. 18 (2012) Cmnd 3809.\n⁶¹⁴ Hsinchun Chen, Dark Web: Exploring and Data Mining the Dark Side of the Web (Springer: New York 2012).\n⁶¹⁵ Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and Paul Syverson, ‘Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router’ (2004) Washington DC: US Naval Research Lab.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction.⁶¹⁷ It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales,⁶¹⁸ all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco.⁶¹⁹ He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment.⁶²⁰ The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany,⁶²¹ but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road,⁶²² that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross\n⁶¹⁷ Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence.⁶²³ Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).⁶²⁴ If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’.⁶²⁵ For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.⁶²⁶\nWe have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook⁶²⁷ and Twitter⁶²⁸ can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level.

Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved.⁶³⁵ We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n⁶²⁹ Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\" uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³⁰ Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" darkhotel-malware=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³¹ Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\" 2015=\"\" 26=\"\" ashley-madison-hack=\"\" fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n⁶³² For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\" security=\"\" article.php=\"\" rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\" www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n⁶³³ Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace.⁶³⁶ As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space.⁶³⁷ Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’.⁶⁴¹ Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict.⁶⁴² In short, a major issue facing international law is\n⁶³⁶ n. 581 (Maogoto, 2014), p. 53.

Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online.⁶⁴⁷ Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state.⁶⁴⁸ Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia\n⁶⁴³ Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n⁶⁴⁴ The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.⁶⁵¹\nAlthough there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians.⁶⁵² As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack.⁶⁵³ In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made.⁶⁵⁴ Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack.⁶⁵⁵ On the other hand, as this area of law is clearly in its infancy, the international response may be more subdued and restrained.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive.⁶⁵⁶ Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state.⁶⁵⁷ Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted.⁶⁵⁸ As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia.⁶⁵⁹ This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack.⁶⁶⁰ ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system.⁶⁶¹ The Conficker Worm again illustrates the issue of attribution. It is still unclear who is, or was, behind the creation of the Worm.⁶⁶² This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace. If the actions of individuals, organisations, and States cannot be accurately attributed to them, an uncertain future awaits, with levels of paranoia within the international community that have not been witnessed since the Cold War era.\n⁶⁵⁶ Council of the European Union, Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, 2009 Report, (Vol II, September 2009).\n⁶⁵⁷ Jose Nazario and Andre Dimino, ‘An In-Depth Look at the Georgia-Russia Cyber Conflict of 2008’ Arbour Networks, Shadowserver Foundation, BTF8, available online at, <https: btf8=\"\" ddos.pdf=\"\" gedos=\"\" ru=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.shadowserver.org=\"\" www.shadowserver.org=\"\" wiki=\"\"> accessed 1 April 2016.\n⁶⁵⁸ n. 606 (Heickerö, 2013), p. 138.\n⁶⁵⁹ n. 652 (Portilho-Shrimpton, 2008).\n⁶⁶⁰ For statistics on Conficker, see, Shadowserver, ‘Conficker’, available online at; <http: conficker=\"\" conficker=\"\" pmwiki.php=\"\" stats=\"\" www.shadowserver.org=\"\" wiki=\"\"> accessed 1 April 2016.\n⁶⁶¹ n. 606 (Heickerö, 2013).\n⁶⁶² ibid, p. 100.\n136</http:></https:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nPerhaps inevitably, the advent of the Stuxnet worm demonstrated the potential for a major cyber-attack. In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today. This has all happened over a remarkably short space of time.

Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom,⁶⁷² faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands.

The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force.⁶⁷³ The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology.⁶⁷⁴ If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.⁶⁷⁵\n⁶⁷³ Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.⁶⁷⁸\nThe threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order.⁶⁷⁹ This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered\n⁶⁷⁶ Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69. The US have also said they will react militarily to cyber-attacks see, Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’ (2002) *Computerworld*, available online at, <http: 2579191=\"\" article=\"\" cybercrime-hacking=\"\" prospect-of-iraq-conflict-raises-new-cyberattack-fears.html=\"\" www.computerworld.com=\"\"> accessed 20 April 2016.\n⁶⁷⁷ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep, p.226 (Hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), para. 39.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however.⁶⁸⁰ If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school.⁶⁸¹ This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.⁶⁸²\nIf states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter,⁶⁸³ there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution.⁶⁸⁴ Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.⁶⁸⁵\nIncreasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online.⁶⁸⁶ Other groups which actually embody\n⁶⁸⁰ n. 663 (Roscini, 2015), p. 236.\n⁶⁸¹ Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n⁶⁸² It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012), p. 232.\n⁶⁸³ n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n⁶⁸⁴ n. 655 (Tsagourias, 2012).\n⁶⁸⁵ ibid, p. 234.\n⁶⁸⁶ For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State. See, Alex Hern, ‘Anonymous “at war” with Isis, hacktivist group confirms’, *The Guardian* (London 17 November 2015),\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nthe ‘anonymous’ moniker are suspected of working with, or on the behest of, states to launch cyber-attacks.⁶⁸⁷ Such actions engage the rules on state responsibility. In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules.⁶⁸⁸ In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks.⁶⁸⁹ This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met.⁶⁹⁰ With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford. Such actions in self-defence,\navailable online at, <https: 17=\"\" 2015=\"\" anonymous-war-isis-hacktivist-group-confirms=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> accessed 15 April 2016.\n⁶⁸⁷ Although this cannot be conclusively confirmed due to attributional issues, attacks such as ‘Turla’ and ‘DarkSeoul’ have been linked to states working through non-state actors.

If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied.⁶⁹² Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law.⁶⁹³ This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.”⁶⁹⁴ We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n⁶⁹¹ Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n⁶⁹² Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2). The Martens Clause first appeared in, Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 29 July 1899, entered into force 4 September 1900) 187 CTS 429 (Hereinafter Hague Convention II 1899), Preamble.\n⁶⁹³ Jean d’Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (forthcoming) ACIL Research Paper 2016-11, <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"2765408\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 25 April 2016, p. 3.\n⁶⁹⁴ ibid.\n143</http:>\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\nAt a basic level, an armed conflict exists when a group acts towards a common goal of injuring, killing, or destroying an opposition.⁶⁹⁵ If a cyber-based attack is intended to cause any of those end results in the physical world, it is well-settled that it should be considered a use of force. The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH),⁶⁹⁶ through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I,⁶⁹⁷ addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons,⁶⁹⁸ or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces,⁶⁹⁹ then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.⁷⁰⁰\nThere have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual).⁷⁰¹ The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to\n⁶⁹⁵ n. 670 (Schmitt, 2002), p. 373.\n⁶⁹⁶ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n⁶⁹⁷ ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n⁶⁹⁸ Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n⁶⁹⁹ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n⁷⁰⁰ Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n⁷⁰¹ n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS\ncyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself.⁷⁰² We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction.⁷⁰³ This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them.⁷⁰⁴ Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces.⁷⁰⁵ Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences.⁷⁰⁶ This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in\n⁷⁰² David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n⁷⁰³ n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78.

When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n707 n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(4).

Conclusion\nThe future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, $^{709}$ and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, $^{710}$ ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n$^{709}$ Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.

A holistic overview of cyberspace as a further realm of human activity is undertaken. A journey through this developing dominion is embarked upon, whereby consideration is given to the ways in which cyberspace can be used to commit traditional actions in a contemporary fashion, as well as how completely new types of exploits, idiosyncratic to cyberspace itself, are being realised. Specific attention is given to existing international treaties and conventions that handle the regulation of cyberspace. Upon examination of these instruments, it is clear that they fail to give sufficient guidance on the regulation of cyberspace. A shift towards clarity and predictability in the regulation of cyberspace will help in providing a safer and more secure realm.\nConvolution typifies the regulation of cyberspace. Legal dilemmas are aplenty. Paranoia and hysteria accompanying the growing cyber threat run parallel to these difficulties. This is understandable, given the unclear and largely unprecedented threats that the law is expected to deal with. Cyberspace must be regulated not just to protect from potential attacks, but also for its general usage. In the civilian sphere, there are many different aspects of cyberspace that need to be considered in relation to regulation. These range from the general usage of cyberspace to cyber-based crime (cybercrime), and even common criminal offences committed through technological means. From a militaristic perspective, cyberspace offers a broad array of new challenges, particularly in relation to cyber-attacks and the use of force. This paper will focus on civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the threats therein. Real world incidents which have demonstrated the power of the cyber world will also be examined. It is important to see reactions to incidents in cyberspace on both a national level and within the international community. With an examination of the international treaties, conventions, and agreements used to regulate the cyber world, it is argued that the methods currently in place are inadequate and lack LL.M. Candidate, The University of Manchester, School of Law.\n\nclarity. This is particularly evident in cases of cyber warfare. Further predictability of the law in this area can help improve the safety of cyberspace for civilians and the security of cyber-based systems for the military.\nCyberspace can be understood as a “global domain within the information environment” characterised by electronic means operating through interconnected networks.574 To the layman, cyberspace is a complex world which is largely taken for granted and can never be fully understood. The multiplicity of sources from which cyberspace can now be accessed creates for a technical and vast area in which to apply legal principles. Cyberspace is no longer a concept of science fiction.575 It works hand-in-hand with the 21st-century world in which we live. From the creation of the telephone576 to the origins of the internet,577 the technological marvels of past times are now embedded in most aspects of everyday life. What is more, the rapid development of such cyber-technology means that fantastical models of the imagination are now being introduced to the public en masse.578 The flip-side of this progress is that its rapidity is exceeding the maturity of legal restraints or even general security controls, which are made largely on a reactive instead of proactive basis.\n\n# I. Civilian applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace\nThe world is now heavily connected. Estimates for 2015 show over seven billion mobile phone subscriptions and over three billion individuals using the internet.^[579]^ With approximations for the total world population recently hitting 7.3 billion people,^[580]^ the vast amount of technology existing globally cannot be understated. It is conceivable that mobile telephone subscriptions will soon overtake the number of people. Clearly, cyberspace has become an indelible part of the world in which we live,^[581]^ and so its regulation needs to be considered. We will now briefly look at some attempts at standardisation.\nIn 1865, the International Telegraph Conference in Paris resulted in the first multilateral agreement of its kind to regulate the use of telegraphs.^[582]^ The International Telegraph Union was conceived at this event. It was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1932 at the International Telecommunication Conference in Madrid, reflecting the technological advancements that now fell within its remit.^[583]^ The ITU is the United Nations (UN) Specialized Agency focusing on information communication technologies.^[584]^ In 1992, the ITU restructured to deliver the agency we have today. This reorganisation lead to three sectors of focus: Radiocommunication (ITU-R); Standardisation (ITU-T); and Development (ITU-D).^[585]^\n^[579]^ International Telecommunication Union, ‘Statistics’, available online at, <http: etu=\"\" itud=\"\" itu-d=\"\" statistics=\"\" pages=\"\" stat=\"\" default.aspx=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed on 7 April 2016.\n^[580]^ United Nations, ‘World Population Prospects 2015’ Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, estimates for 2015 available to download online from, <http: download=\"\" esaa.un.org=\"\" population=\"\" unpd=\"\" standard=\"\"></http:> accessed 27 April 2016.\n^[581]^ Although generally used in the context of warfare, this “fifth domain” can also be applied generally.

At this point, it must be stressed that the ITU does not have any regulatory enforcement power or any goal to that end. It is the oldest intergovernmental organisation, made up of 700 members, including 193 Member States, as well as International Organisations, universities, and technology corporations.⁵⁸⁶ Much of its work is based in study groups and results of the work released through statistics, with the aim of protecting the “fundamental right to communicate.”⁵⁸⁷\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) convened over two phases by the ITU – Geneva in 2003⁵⁸⁸ and Tunis in 2005⁵⁸⁹ – recognised the indispensable nature within cyberspace of the freedom of expression, flow of information, ideas, and knowledge.⁵⁹⁰ Such aims and focuses are vital to civilian enjoyment of cyberspace. As another domain of human activity, such fundamental human rights, like the freedom of expression, must be considered on an international level.⁵⁹¹ As with all international law, however, the rules pertaining to cyberspace are politically influenced. Much of the issues that can arise, do so because of traditional tensions between democratic and authoritarian standpoints. Certain agreements, such as the 2009 Agreement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,⁵⁹² in which\n⁵⁸⁶ International Telecommunication Union (n 584).\n⁵⁸⁷ ibid.\n⁵⁸⁸ Resulting in, World Summit on the Information Society, Declaration of Principles.

Definitions within the Agreement indicate a neglect of the protection of individual freedoms, such as of expression, and an emphasis on state sovereignty online.⁵⁹³ The International Treaty Regulations (ITRs) also demonstrate the opposing political tensions at work and are the focus of the next part of this essay.\nOriginating in 1988,⁵⁹⁴ the ITRs have been contained within a global treaty with the intention of establishing general principles with regards to international telecommunications, under the auspices of the ITU. Recommendations for amendments were most recently mooted in 2012, in which the dramatic growth of the internet ensured its position as a key topic on the agenda.⁵⁹⁵ The revisions proposed for the ITRs contained elements indicating further governance over the internet. As the ITRs were conceived in relation to telecommunications principally, the attention given to the internet seemed, to some states, as over-stretching.⁵⁹⁶ However, it would be absurd to ignore the importance of the internet in global communication. Frictions between the importance placed on protecting freedoms and protecting territorial sovereignty on the internet resulted in the unsuccessful revision of the Regulations.⁵⁹⁷ Only 89 countries, from a possible 144, signed the revised Regulations. Those who did came from a communist background and included China and Russia. Despite all of this, the Regulations do not have any authoritative legal command and hold no obligatory or mandatory power over state parties, unless they have been incorporated into national legislation. As such, the actual influence the treaty has is minimal. The ITU cannot enforce the treaty and it, ⁵⁹³ David P Fidler, ‘Cyberspace and Human Rights’ in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.)

We will now focus on further ways in which civilian cyberspace can be regulated.\nA rather idiosyncratic feature of civilian cyberspace is its layers of self-regulation. The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) exemplifies such self-regulation. ICANN is a non-profit, private sector organisation, which maintains the online database of names and addresses, namely the Domain Name System (DNS). Due to the fluidity of the internet and the ease at which online pages can be formed, it is perhaps surprising that this is not regulated through a large international organisation. The plasticity of the internet is a great advantage to meeting the aforementioned freedoms, although such freedoms are where problems with self-regulation can arise.\nAgain, the political aspect of cyberspace for public consumption is apparent. As an American institution, ICANN adopts American principles in its work. However, as ICANN essentially regulates the ‘registration plates’ for the internet on a global scale, it is perplexing that this is not handled through more transnational cooperation. Through ICANN, the private sector has developed a system of self-regulation through three principal methods: the ‘Code’ the DNS and the ‘Architecture’. ICANN carries out these functions through Functions Contracts with various actors, including the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce, the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), as well as another large US corporation, Verisign Inc. \n Vincent G Cerf, ‘The Internet at Risk’ (2013) 17(2) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society 3, p. 4.\n The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ‘What Does ICANN Do?’, available online at, <https: news=\"\"pages=\"\"resources=\"\"what-2012-02-25-en=\"\"www.icann.org=\"\"> accessed 7 April 2016.\n ibid.\n Milton L Mueller, *Networks and states: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* (MIT Press: Cambridge, 2010), p. 62-3.\n126</https:> MANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS Open source software further encapsulates the levels of self-regulation within civilian cyberspace. Such software, such as the Mozilla Firefox browser, can be accessed and customised by its users. The advantage of this is that the software can be adapted to the individual needs of a user, in an environment in which vulnerabilities can be recognised and resolved with speed and ease, for the benefit of the community of users operating on the same platform.⁶⁰² With these vulnerabilities comes the greater potential for abuse, however, with theoretically more widespread damage to the system as a whole in the event of such abuse, and no central support system in place.⁶⁰³ As mentioned above, the legal basis of the self-regulation that largely characterises civilian cyberspace at most only amounts to soft law.⁶⁰⁴ Nonetheless, this is not necessarily negative. Due to the tensions discussed between territorial sovereignty and individual freedoms in cyberspace, the implementation of hard law regulating civilian cyberspace has the potential to prejudice one of these positions. We will now look at some of the threats that cyberspace in the civilian domain faces.\nAs we have seen, there are many States, organisations, and agencies involved in working towards a cyber world which benefits all. The benefits of freedom of information and expression, however, do not come without the threats and disadvantages of such a connected world. Parallel to the advantages and expediency of cyberspace are factors that could endanger the enjoyment or even safety of those partaking in online activities. Cyber-attacks develop in the same way as other technology. As we will see, these take place against civilian and military targets across jurisdictions in a borderless online world. Although we will first deal with civilian ⁶⁰² Steven Weber, *The Success of Open Source* (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2004).\n⁶⁰³ Greg Madey et al, ‘The Open Source Software Development Phenomenon: An Analysis Based on Social Network Theory’ (2002) Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 1806.\n⁶⁰⁴ For more on Soft Organisations in international law see, Jan Klabbers, ‘Institutional Ambivalence by Design: Soft Organizations in International Law’ (2001) 70 Nordic Journal of International Law 403. For criticisms of soft law see, Jean d’Aspremont, ‘Softness in International Law: A Self-Serving Quest for New Legal Materials’ (2008) 19(5) European Journal of International Law 1075.\n\nthreats, due to the porous nature of cyberspace, the same threats can similarly affect military targets.\nAttacks on computer systems can come in many forms, such as viruses, worms, trojan horses, and malicious software (malware). Infection of systems can also occur in various ways including through targeted attacks or through random targeting on a widespread basis. Cyber-attacks can cause havoc and destruction (at its worst) or inconvenience (at best) to their victims, to be considered a success for the attacker. Potential victims need to be successful in their evasion of such attacks every time. A notorious method for infiltrating systems is the 'phishing' technique. Phishing is a basic form of attack which can be extremely effective. By posing as a trustworthy source, the attacker can acquire sensitive information from its victim, if successful.[605] This occurred, for example, in 2006, when the Scandinavian bank, Norden, was attacked and had sensitive financial information stolen about its customers.[606] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the US has highlighted how serious the threats we face online can be. Cybercrime is recorded third in the list of the FBI's scale of threats, behind only terrorism and counterintelligence (espionage).[607] When considering that the two threats ranked as more serious than cybercrime can also be committed through, or in, cyberspace, it makes for a harrowing prospect for future security. The mysterious world in which cybercriminals operate has led to the inception of a somewhat $21^{\\text{st}}$ -century folk devil in the form of online criminals and hackers.[608] [605] Rachna Dhamija, J D Tygar and Marti Hearst, ‘Why Phishing Works’ (2006) *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, Association for Computing Machinery 581.

The Convention dealt with various issues regarding online criminality, with a focus on computer-related fraud,⁶¹⁰ offences related to child pornography,⁶¹¹ and copyright violations.⁶¹² Much of the foci were therefore on offences not idiosyncratic to cyberspace. However, it still marked an important step in the international acknowledgement of the criminal activity that can take place in cyberspace. International agreement on the principles contained within the Convention had the goal of percolating into national legislation and thus becoming hard law.⁶¹³ Conventions such as these are necessary for the development of offences to be applied to acts committed in cyberspace.\nAnother way in which the cyber world can have ramifications in the physical world is through the ‘deep web’, and more specifically, the ‘dark net’. The deep web is the label given to the unindexed content that sits beneath the visible content on the internet (the ‘surface web’).⁶¹⁴ The dark net is the hidden area of the deep web which requires software, such as the military-grade ‘Tor’, to gain access.⁶¹⁵ As its appellation suggests, the dark net is hidden. Use of it cannot be traced by law enforcement, intelligence, or any other government agencies (or anyone else for that matter) in the way that actions on the conventional internet can be. This makes it a popular environment for criminals to operate, as well as journalists and even undercover police officers.⁶¹⁶ As with much of the ⁶⁰⁹ Council of Europe Convention for Cybercrime (adopted 23 November 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) ETS 185 (Hereinafter Convention for Cybercrime).\n⁶¹⁰ ibid, Article 8.\n⁶¹¹ ibid, Article 9.\n⁶¹² ibid, Article 10.\n⁶¹³ For example, in the United Kingdom, it came into force through, Convention for Cybercrime (1 September 2011) Treaty Series No. 18 (2012) Cmnd 3809.\n⁶¹⁴ Hsinchun Chen, Dark Web: Exploring and Data Mining the Dark Side of the Web (Springer: New York 2012).\n⁶¹⁵ Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and Paul Syverson, ‘Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router’ (2004) Washington DC: US Naval Research Lab.

To clarify, Silk Road made headlines for the ability of its users to purchase drugs, and even, for example, order the services of a hitman from their computer in a virtually untraceable transaction.⁶¹⁷ It is reported that it made $1.2 billion in sales,⁶¹⁸ all underpinned by the virtual currency ‘Bitcoin’, further adding to the covert nature of the medium. After extensive investigations and legal processes, the FBI arrested the supposed mastermind of Silk Road. 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was arrested whilst logged into the administrator’s account in a public library in San Francisco.⁶¹⁹ He was eventually convicted and received five sentences including two for life imprisonment.⁶²⁰ The full force of the law, usually used in the physical world, was felt by Ulbricht because of actions taken in cyberspace.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about the Silk Road saga is the way in which the FBI managed to shut down the website. They traced the servers to Iceland and Germany,⁶²¹ but the techniques used to find them have not been revealed. This has led to accusations of the FBI hacking into Silk Road,⁶²² that is, fighting criminal enterprise through a violation of individual rights (in this case, Ross ⁶¹⁷ Martin James, ‘Lost on the Silk Road: Online drug distribution and the “cryptomarket”’ (2014) 14(3) Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice 351.

Legal dangers for the authorities themselves then become somewhat apparent. In this case, the issue at hand was over rights contained within the US Constitution relating to improperly obtaining evidence.⁶²³ Similar principles can also be found in international legal instruments, such as comparable articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).⁶²⁴ If law enforcement agencies turn to hacking online communities and individuals within them, it sets a dangerous precedent and runs the risk of encroaching on the rights and freedoms of individuals. The case also demonstrates a lack of international cooperation in the handling of cybercrime perpetrators.\nActions in cyberspace can also result in legal consequences in the physical world on a smaller scale. This can be seen through abusive and deliberately inflammatory comments made online, often anonymously, which has been termed ‘trolling’.⁶²⁵ For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the Malicious Communications Act can and has been used, to prosecute individuals for such online abuse.⁶²⁶ We have seen how actions in cyberspace can have effects in the physical realm regarding civilians. Such actions can also have a simultaneous effect in cyberspace. For example, online trolling on social media sites such as Facebook⁶²⁷ and Twitter⁶²⁸ can lead to online sanctions. Blocking or removing particular accounts from such sites is only a short-term solution and has the potential to become somewhat circular, again due to the plasticity of the internet. Certain actions in cyberspace can result in more destructive effects, for example economically, as well as personal ramifications, for victims on an individual level.

Additionally, striving for justice for cyber-attacks is often futile due to the inherent anonymity of cyberspace.\nCybersecurity on a state level presents another platform in which political attitudes can have influence. This can be observed through, for example, an authoritarian state such as China. Cybersecurity has different connotations for States such as China, as, through online censorship of its residents, control over challenges to the authority of the communist regime can be achieved.⁶³⁵ We will now look at how cyberspace is used in a military setting, with attention given to real-world incidents that have shaped the discussion around regulation of cyberspace for military purposes.\n⁶²⁹ Lisa Ricchwine, ‘Cyber attack could cost Sony studio as much as $100 million’ (2014) Reuters, available online at, <http: article=\"\"us-sony-cybersecurity-costs-iduskbn0jn2l020141209=\"\"uk.reuters.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³⁰ Kim Zetter, ‘DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests’ (2014) Wired, available online at, <https: 11=\"\"2014=\"\"darkhotel-malware=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 May 2016.\n⁶³¹ Robert Hackett, ‘What to know about the Ashley Madison hack’ (2015) Fortune, available online at, <http: 08=\"\"2015=\"\"26=\"\"ashley-madison-hack=\"\"fortune.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 15 April 2016.\n⁶³² For example, Richard Adhikari, ‘RBS WorldPay Data Breach hits 1.5 million’ internetnews.com, 24 December 2008, available online at, <http: 3793386=\"\"security=\"\"article.php=\"\"rbs+worldpay+data+breach+hits+15+million.htm=\"\"www.internetnews.com=\"\"> accessed 27 April 2016.\n⁶³³ Such as the infamous malware affecting Adobe software.

Military applications, threats, and regulation in cyberspace The military sphere relies on technology and cyberspace to a similar extent as the civilian world. For example, military operations on the ground are supported with technologies from radio contact to satellite imagery support. In addition to traditional methods of warfare in which technology plays its part, the “fifth domain” of warfare is indeed cyberspace.⁶³⁶ As already indicated above, this follows the traditional methods of land, sea, and air, as well as the possibility of warfare in the fourth domain of outer space.⁶³⁷ Throughout the last decade, there have been notable attacks orchestrated by, and directed at, States and their online systems, such as ‘Code Red’, ‘Turla’, ‘Regin’, and the work of the ‘Equation Group’.⁶⁴¹ Again, attribution of such attacks is an issue. The law that governs the fifth domain of cyberspace in a military context will be the focus of this part of the paper.\nHow cyber-attacks directed towards States are perceived by the international community is decisive regarding the methods used to deal with them. Such attacks can be distinguished as Information Operations (IO) which generally occur outside the existence of a conflict, and Information Warfare (IW) which is resorted to during a conflict.⁶⁴² In short, a major issue facing international law is ⁶³⁶ n. 581, p. 53.

Much of its national infrastructure is based upon and within technological means. For example, 97% of all banking transactions in Estonia are made online.⁶⁴⁷ Whilst this delivers convenience, it inevitably leaves the country vulnerable to attacks on the structure upon which it is based. Such attacks can be committed from anywhere else with internet access; this vulnerability was indeed exploited in 2007, in the first cyber-attack of its kind against a sovereign state.⁶⁴⁸ Following the movement of the ‘Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn’ statue from the city centre in Tallinn to a military cemetery, riots and cyber-attacks against Estonia ensued. The monument was originally built in 1944 during the Soviet era, and its relocation angered many Russians. Through two main waves of attack, Estonia ⁶⁴³ Charter of the United Nations (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI (Hereinafter UN Charter), Article 2(4). ‘Force’ in Article 2(4) has been seen as broad enough to include cyber-attacks see, Richard W Aldrich, ‘How do you know you are at war in the information age?’ (2000) 22 Houston Journal of International Law 223, p. 254.\n⁶⁴⁴ The type of force is not specified in Article 2(4) UN Charter see, Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by states* (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1963) p. 265-70.

Of course, this had a negative impact on Estonia, particularly from an economic standpoint.⁶⁵¹ Although there has never been any conclusive evidence to this effect, it is strongly believed that the cyber-attacks emanated from Russia, and were committed by Russians.⁶⁵² As Estonia is a NATO member state, collective self-defence could be invoked under the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of an armed attack.⁶⁵³ In the wake of the cyber-attacks on Estonia, the incident was dealt with entirely under criminal law and no invocation of collective self-defence was made.⁶⁵⁴ Such action, or inaction, may indicate that the international perspective on cyber-attacks is that they do not reach the threshold of an armed attack.⁶⁵⁵ On the other hand, as this area of law is clearly in its infancy, the international response may be more subdued and restrained.

In another prime example of unprecedented events taking place, the world witnessed the first combination of cyber-attacks with a military offensive.⁶⁵⁶ Before any military action had begun, DDoS attacks on a small scale were launched against the state.⁶⁵⁷ Georgia suffered website deficiencies and more seriously, larger DDoS attacks, as well as ‘SQL injections’, which supplement DDoS attacks through installing junk code which is intended to mystify the back-end database of the websites being targeted.⁶⁵⁸ As with the cyber-attacks on Estonia, although Russia was, and is, suspected of having carried out the attacks, there is no concrete evidence to link the Russian authorities to the events in Georgia.⁶⁵⁹ This highlights the recurring issue of attribution, which will be developed further, later in this paper.\nThe introduction, also in 2008, of the largest computer worm known to date, went on to infect more computers than any other attack.⁶⁶⁰ ‘Conficker’, as it is known, was specially designed to attack computers running a Windows operating system.⁶⁶¹ The Conficker Worm again illustrates the issue of attribution. It is still unclear who is, or was, behind the creation of the Worm.⁶⁶² This impedes the development of legal doctrine dealing with the regulation of cyberspace.

In the first experience of its kind, the Iranian Nuclear Program was infiltrated by a computer-born weapon in 2009, targeted at disrupting the nuclear centrifuges in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.^[663]^ It is the first worm to be credited with targeting real-world infrastructure.^[664]^ The potential of such cyber warfare weapons was immediately realised. This worm had penetrated a security system of the highest level and could directly manipulate the nuclear materials the system was meant to protect. Disaster could plausibly have ensued. What further complicates matters is that the attack appeared to be almost certainly the actions of States, due to the level of sophistication and the strength and capability of the worm.^[665]^ Israel and the US have become the main suspects for the Stuxnet attack. It almost does not matter whether they were responsible for its creation or not. The fact that this had occurred and international law had no recourse to deal with the attack is the main concern. There is growing trepidation across the international community towards the potential for terrorist groups to gain control of nuclear materials and make a weapon with such capabilities.^[666]^ A targeted cyber-attack in the vein of Stuxnet is indeed a plausible technique by which such groups could gain control of dangerous materials.\nComputer viruses have not always been of such high levels of sophistication. The first viruses to emerge, in the 1980s, mainly destroyed information on the computers being targeted rather than aiming to steal that information.^[667]^ Such malware has developed into the highly intricate labyrinths of code in action today.

Law, particularly international law, which is largely based on custom,⁶⁷² faces perhaps its biggest challenge yet. The technology behind potential cyber warfare is advancing at an astounding rate. Even the technological defences to cyber-attacks are left in the dust of offensive capabilities. For laws to be developed in such an environment is a monumental challenge. New treaties, conventions, and agreements would realistically take many years of ripening to tackle the issues. However, applying existing international legal principles to these new developments carries its own demands. As the world scratches its head over the response to such events, the ⁶⁶⁸ Jared Diamond, *Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of everybody for the last 13,000 years* (Vintage Books: London, 1998), p. 253.

The proposition of ‘instant’ custom has been made see, Bin Cheng, ‘United Nations Resolutions on Outer Space: “Instant” International Customary Law?” (1965) 5 Indian Journal of International Law 23, but this is generally rejected.\n\nshady area of little to no regulation is being evidenced by viruses and worms such as Stuxnet. The deniability that comes hand in hand with cyber-attacks is part of the reason for this. But the lack of proper regulation using established international legal principles means that when serious cyber-attacks from States on other States occur, there may be no obvious redress that can be sought by the victim state. We will now examine the options available in such circumstances.\nMuch of the legal framework used to regulate cyberspace comes from existing treaties and custom surrounding, for example, armed attacks. When such treaties dealing with armed attacks were first drafted, the only consideration at the time was of military force.⁶⁷³ The biggest obstacle for states and international organisations, progressing into the technological age has been, and will be, the use of these existing laws, to suit an area of law which is evolving at a much slower rate than the technology for which it is meant to regulate.\nUse of force may no longer automatically mean the use of traditional artillery on the battlefield. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone would argue that the use of a nuclear weapon in an attack against another state would not amount to a use of force. This is just another development of technology.⁶⁷⁴ If cyber-attacks can cause physical damage in the ‘real’ world then there is no legitimate argument as to why it should not be considered a use of force.⁶⁷⁵ ⁶⁷³ Elizabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by states in Self-Defence’ (2005) Chatham House, ILP WP 05/01, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, p. 6.

What must be clear is the threshold of a use of force. This is where lies many of the problems and disagreements in this field.⁶⁷⁸ The threshold for a use of force (armed attack) with which a cyber-attack must reach can be seen through different perspectives. One viewpoint is offered by Professor Reisman, who amalgamates several categories that represent force, regardless of legality, as having occurred if coercive actions challenge or enrich world order.⁶⁷⁹ This can be understood in the light of a target-based approach and applies irrespective of damage done. If an attack is aimed at national infrastructure, it will automatically be considered ⁶⁷⁶ Martin Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and cyberwar* (The RAND Corporation: California, 2009), p. 69.

The target-based approach is over-inclusive, however.⁶⁸⁰ If a small-level attack which did little or no damage to critical national infrastructure was worthy of being perceived as a use of force, a dangerous precedent might be set. On the other hand, coercion and violence on a large and international scale could amount to the use of force, through the lens of the New Haven school.⁶⁸¹ This can be more closely assimilated with a ‘consequence’ or ‘effects-based’ approach. Through this approach, the cyber-attack will only reach the threshold of an armed attack if it has direct damaging effects on people and objects. Cyber-based attacks can target many facets of infrastructure, which all have the potential to have such damaging effects on people and objects.⁶⁸² If states were to respond to cyber-attacks, under their inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in the UN Charter,⁶⁸³ there are attributional issues that must be overcome. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks and cyberspace in general, this may take considerably longer and involve much more complex processes than with traditional modes of conflict. Attribution will require technical and political calculation on top of the necessary legal attribution.⁶⁸⁴ Cyberspace offers attackers anonymity, the platform to launch multiple, simultaneous, and successive attacks, as well as the opportunity to deliver attacks with a haste that is alien to comparable kinetic attacks.⁶⁸⁵ Increasingly, non-state actors are becoming involved in attacks launched against both civilian and state targets. Vigilante organisations such as the infamous, and satirically named, hacker group ‘Anonymous’ have progressively claimed responsibility for high-profile actions online.⁶⁸⁶ Other groups which actually embody ⁶⁸⁰ n. 663, p. 236.\n⁶⁸¹ Myers S McDougal and Florentino P Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1961).\n⁶⁸² It has even been suggested that if a cyber-attack was directed at a State’s national infrastructure such as the financial system as a whole, it could amount to a use of force see, n. 655, p. 232.\n⁶⁸³ n. 643 (UN Charter), Article 51.\n⁶⁸⁴ n. 655.\n⁶⁸⁵ ibid, p. 234.\n⁶⁸⁶ For example, their efforts against the so called Islamic State. See, Alex Hern, ‘Anonymous “at war” with Isis, hacktivist group confirms’, *The Guardian* (London 17 November 2015), MANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS the ‘anonymous’ moniker are suspected of working with, or on the behest of, states to launch cyber-attacks.⁶⁸⁷ Such actions engage the rules on state responsibility. In very much the same way as comparable physical actions, wrongful acts committed in cyberspace by states will be subject to these rules.⁶⁸⁸ In addition to this, the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case will apply in cases regarding the use of non-state groups to launch such attacks.⁶⁸⁹ This can be straightforwardly transposed from the rules which have developed in relation to kinetic actions. The difficulties, as already discussed above, are in relation to the high levels of deniability that cyber-attacks afford the aggressor.\nProfessor Tsagourias suggests the lengths required to go to for the attribution necessary in relation to cyber-attacks, emphasising technical, political, and legal aspects, needed to be met.⁶⁹⁰ With only an indifferent reference to it, he appears to overlook a crucial issue in this area – time. When a state is dealing with a cyber-attack in real time, it is likely to be unprepared. During the resulting confusion, the time acquiring the technical, political, and legal requirements of attribution that he suggests, pales into insignificance. Hypothetically speaking, if a state is suffering a prolonged cyber-attack to its critical national infrastructure, whereby the only way to stop it would be to act in self-defence, the luxury of thorough and in depth investigation is one which the victim state could simply not afford.

The ICJ reaffirmed the ‘effective control’ test in *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro*), 26 February 2007, ICJ Rep, p. 43 (Hereinafter *Bosnia Genocide* Case), para. 406.\n⁶⁹⁰ n. 655.\n142</https:> MANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS without true attributional confirmation, is of concern, however.⁶⁹¹ As such, a general test for attribution based on a principle such as on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could be a solution. If this was strictly applied to acting in self-defence only through cyberspace, such a test would likely be more effective than if it allowed for a reaction in the kinetic world. It does face obstacles, however, in that due to the nature of the sphere in which cyber-attacks occur, it is not difficult to frame an attack as coming from a certain state or actor. This does not mean that the test on the ‘balance of probabilities’ could never operate successfully, as contextual and sociological factors can also be applied.\nIf a conflict is perceived to exist following a cyber-attack reaching the threshold for an armed attack, the LOAC will become relevant. The Martens Clause is intended to deal with areas of the LOAC that are not yet regulated and allows for the principles already in place to be applied.⁶⁹² Indeed, there is a distinct lack of new legal frameworks or legislation regarding cyberspace under international law.⁶⁹³ This has, in turn, had the inevitable consequence of international lawyers feeling as though cyberspace is an area left “dangerously unregulated.”⁶⁹⁴ We will now look at the regulations that can be applied to cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict.\n⁶⁹¹ Evidential difficulties such as this were recognised by the ICJ in, *Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Rep, p. 4, p. 18.\n⁶⁹² Modern version of the Martens Clause is embodied in, Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (adopted 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1978) 1125 UNTS 3 (Hereinafter Additional Protocol I), Article 1(2). The Martens Clause first appeared in, Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 29 July 1899, entered into force 4 September 1900) 187 CTS 429 (Hereinafter Hague Convention II 1899), Preamble.\n⁶⁹³ Jean d’Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law (forthcoming) ACIL Research Paper 2016-11, <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"2765408\"papers.ssrn.com=\"\"sol3=\"\"> accessed 25 April 2016, p. 3.\n⁶⁹⁴ ibid.\n143</http:> MANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS At a basic level, an armed conflict exists when a group acts towards a common goal of injuring, killing, or destroying an opposition.⁶⁹⁵ If a cyber-based attack is intended to cause any of those end results in the physical world, it is well-settled that it should be considered a use of force. The problems, however, include how the principle of distinction can be retained and attributional issues pertaining to cyber-attacks. To launch such an attack is not necessarily an intrinsically military capability and this, therefore, raises questions relating to civilians directly participating in hostilities (DPH),⁶⁹⁶ through their actions in cyberspace. This further adds to the conglomeration of issues that cyber warfare has brought to international law.\nPrior to discussion of the rules pertaining to the LOAC and its potential application to cyber warfare, it should first be considered whether a cyber weapon can be treated as a weapon at all. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I,⁶⁹⁷ addresses new weaponry. This includes the duty to determine whether it would be prohibited in any way by Additional Protocol I. As has been established above, cyber-attacks can occur across a range of methods against an array of targets. If a cyber-attack was aimed at the release of a prohibited weapon under international law, such as incendiary weapons,⁶⁹⁸ or could have an effect on a work or installation containing dangerous forces,⁶⁹⁹ then the legality of the cyber weapon itself needs to be considered, not just the use of it, as the literature has focused on thus far.⁷⁰⁰ There have been attempts to create a document that can be applied to cyberwarfare. One such example is the Tallinn Manual of the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Tallinn Manual).⁷⁰¹ The Manual argues for the application of the LOAC to ⁶⁹⁵ n. 670, p. 373.\n⁶⁹⁶ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(3).\n⁶⁹⁷ ibid (Additional Protocol I), Article 36.\n⁶⁹⁸ Jean-Marie Henckaerts, Louise Doswald-Beck, ICRC: Customary International Humanitarian Law, Volume I: Rules (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2005) (Hereinafter ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 84.\n⁶⁹⁹ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 57.\n⁷⁰⁰ Katharina Ziolkowski, ‘Computer Network operations and the law of armed conflict’ (2010) 49 Military Law and Law of War Review 47, p. 69.\n⁷⁰¹ n. 675 (Tallinn Manual).\nMANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS cyber-attacks and the principles that apply in physical warfare to be applied also to cyber warfare. Applying the rules in place for physical conflict, to the fifth domain of warfare, would appear straightforward. However, this overlooks the complexities within the LOAC itself. Much of the LOAC is contested. When adding to it the novel issues that cyberwarfare creates, it does not become any more straightforward. This is complicated further, as the Tallinn manual's authors come from NATO Member States, and despite declarations to the contrary, can be seen as representing the attitudes and values of NATO itself.⁷⁰² We will now look at some of the ways in which cyber-attacks can create issues within the LOAC.\nOne of the cornerstones of the LOAC is the principle of distinction.⁷⁰³ This principle is important as it relates to who can be targeted in an armed conflict. It protects civilians in prohibiting the intended and deliberate targeting of them.⁷⁰⁴ Cyberspace is accessible by all and does not face the same physical restraints as kinetic attacks. This may have numerous military advantages, including a reduction of personnel on the physical battlefield, and the ability to launch attacks from one part of the world to have an effect in another. There is, however, the danger of attacks spilling into the civilian sphere, and also those which could release dangerous forces.⁷⁰⁵ Cyberspace is inherently of a dual-use character. An attack aimed at a military target, therefore, could plausibly have residual effects in the civilian cyberspace domain. Attacks against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been known to cause disruption and have the potential for disastrous consequences.⁷⁰⁶ This can also occur transnationally over a borderless online world. An attack in ⁷⁰² David P Fidler, ‘NATO, Cyber Defense, and International Law’ (2013) 4 St. John’s Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law 1.\n⁷⁰³ n. 677 (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion), p. 257, para. 78. See also, n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 48. See also n. 698 (ICRC Study on CIHL), Rule 1.\n⁷⁰⁴ n. 692 (Additional Protocol I), Article 51(2).\n⁷⁰⁵ For example, see, ibid (Additional Protocol I), Articles 52, 54 and 56. The aforementioned Stuxnet attack could have potentially led to the release of ‘dangerous forces’, for example.\n⁷⁰⁶ n. 671, p. 58-9. See also Calvery Bowers, ‘A Plan for SCADA Security to deter DoS Attacks’ (2005) in Calvery Bowers et al, s.1 Proceedings of the Department of Homeland Security, R&amp;D Partnering Conference.\n\ncyberspace has the potential of becoming indiscriminate and as such violating one of the main tenets of the LOAC.707 The law applicable to cyber warfare faces further challenges when principles such as proportionality are considered. When examining the *jus in bello* (how armed conflicts are to be conducted), the way in which a cyber weapon is used within the conflict needs to be regulated to cover the extent of its use and collateral damage. As has been seen throughout this essay, cyber-attacks can have exponential and potentially uncontrollable effects once released from human control. This has led to some unhelpful suggestions. Professor Schmitt, for example, argues that once a cyber weapon has left the control of the individual operating it, they no longer have control over its effects. As such, any indiscriminate effects occurring thereon because of the cyber weapon is not a result of the weapons system itself and cannot be attributed to the human actor, or who they work on behalf of.708 Such an argument appears to be based on a willingness to relinquish all human responsibility for a cyber-attack. This is a dangerous suggestion. It is analogous to blindly dropping many bombs at a military target on a windy day, and once the bombs have been released, the effects they have, be indiscriminate or not, are not the responsibility of those who dropped them. An eccentric hypothetical situation such as this highlights the absurdity of Professor Schmitt’s submission.\n\n146</https:> MANCHESTER REVIEW OF LAW, CRIME AND ETHICS ## III. Conclusion The future of cyberspace is both predictable and unpredictable. It is both rosy and gloomy. The potential benefits seem unconstrained and perpetual. Undercutting this is the growing threat to the safety and security of those who operate within cyberspace. As this essay has discussed, there are many actors participating in cyberspace. Rising levels of reports of ‘ransomware’ affecting cyber systems, and the impending threat of a large-scale attack on portable ‘smart’ phones, ensure an uncertain future for the widespread stability of the domain. From a militaristic perspective, it is now clear that cyberspace is certainly a field from which attacks can originate. It can be used to great effect in individual and coordinated offensive military strikes. More harrowing is the prospect of terrorist organisations acquiring the competence to launch cyber-attacks against high-profile targets and even critical national infrastructure. Such occurrences could have monumental impacts on both civilian and military applications for cyberspace and the domain as a whole. Any attack of this kind would threaten the two most highly venerated tenets within cyberspace – online freedoms and online sovereignty. Attributional issues have been highlighted as a critical obstacle to the further development of legal regulation in cyberspace. This essay has demonstrated some of the inadequacies of the current legal framework pertaining to cyberspace, and offered suggestions of improvements that can be made in both the civilian sphere and on the military stage. The not-too-distant future will be sure to illuminate further developments in both the capabilities of the cyber world and the principles used to regulate it.\n Alexandre Gazet, ‘Comparative analysis of various ransomware virii’ (2010) 6(1) Journal in Computer Virology 77.
