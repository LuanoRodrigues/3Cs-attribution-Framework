CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\n\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

            "markdown": "Several months later, in October, and a month before the U.S. presidential election, the U.S. government (USG) made its own public attribution through a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the director of National Intelligence. In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\n\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the",

Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\n\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\n\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\n\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\n\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and",

This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\n\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\n\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\n\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\n\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE",

This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\n\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\n\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\n\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.",

            "markdown": "Attribution by the Private Sector\n\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\n\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\n\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\n\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to",

As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\n\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\n\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\n\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups.

For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\n\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\n\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\n\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n\n##",

Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\n\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3",

In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\n\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\n\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\n\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\n\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\n\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven",

The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\n\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\n\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\n\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3",

One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\n\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\n\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\n\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\n\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE",

The purpose of attribution. What are the motivations, reasons, and value of private-sector and government stakeholders attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state or other threat actor?\n2. The risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG (including IC and law enforcement); that is, does attribution by the private sector pose any risks to the USG (such as forcing it to act prematurely), or does it present any benefits (such as helping provide an unclassified vehicle for discussions)?\n3. A comparison of capabilities between private-sector companies and USG agencies; that is, which group has better or different capabilities for information visibility, acquisition, and analysis, relative to the other?\n4. Opportunities for collaboration between the USG and private sector. Given that these groups now exist in this ecosystem, what sort of collaboration makes sense going forward?\n\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company).

All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\n\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n\n### Purpose of Attribution\n\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\n\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\n\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building).

And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\n\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n\n### Risks\n\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\n\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and",

One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\n\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\n\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\n\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would",

Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\n\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\n\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively",

It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\n\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\n\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\n\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations",

The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\n\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\n\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\n\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that",

For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\n\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\n\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE",

Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\n\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\n\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\n\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n\n##",

The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\n\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\n\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6.

The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution.[56] The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.[59]\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n1. The purpose of attribution. What are the motivations, reasons, and value of private-sector and government stakeholders attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state or other threat actor?\n2. The risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG (including IC and law enforcement); that is, does attribution by the private sector pose any risks to the USG (such as forcing it to act prematurely), or does it present any benefits (such as helping provide an unclassified vehicle for discussions)?\n3. A comparison of capabilities between private-sector companies and USG agencies; that is, which group has better or different capabilities for information visibility, acquisition, and analysis, relative to the other?\n4. Opportunities for collaboration between the USG and private sector. Given that these groups now exist in this ecosystem, what sort of collaboration makes sense going forward?\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

An APT may or may not be under the direct control of a nation-state.\n20 See Chris Porter, “Toward Practical Cyber Counter Deception,” Journal of International Affairs (Winter 2016); Matt Bishop, Carrie Gates, and Jeffrey Hunker, “Sisterhood of the Travelling Packets,” NSPW’09, 8–11 September 2009, Oxford, UK; Brian Bartholomew and Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, “Wave Your False Flags!

There are many other examples of malicious actors using attack infrastructure, code, or techniques used by other attackers with the intention of confounding attribution.\n21 An example of this is the Cyber Caliphate incident against TV5Monde that was originally attributed to the Islamic State, but was later determined to be Russian.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\n22 Jason Healey, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” Atlantic Council Issue Brief, 2011, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/beyond-attribution-seeking-national-responsibility-in-cyberspace/; Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries* (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\n23 See discussion of legal responsibility of states for cyber actions emanating from their territory.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

He can be contacted at bboudreau@rand.org.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSeveral months later, in October, and a month before the U.S. presidential election, the U.S. government (USG) made its own public attribution through a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the director of National Intelligence. In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6. Timeline of BRONZE UNION activity (images by the author based on data from SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit Intelligence, \"Threat Group 3390 Cyberespionage,\" https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage, accessed 10 November 2019). The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution.[56] The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.[59]\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6.

The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution.[56] The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.[59]\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6. Timeline of BRONZE UNION activity (images by the author based on data from SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit Intelligence, \"Threat Group 3390 Cyberespionage,\" https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage, accessed 10 November 2019). The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution.[56] The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.[59]\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity. Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time, while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity. Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party, and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6.

The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694. Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence. The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices, the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\" Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived. On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n1. The purpose of attribution. What are the motivations, reasons, and value of private-sector and government stakeholders attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state or other threat actor?\n2. The risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG (including IC and law enforcement); that is, does attribution by the private sector pose any risks to the USG (such as forcing it to act prematurely), or does it present any benefits (such as helping provide an unclassified vehicle for discussions)?\n3. A comparison of capabilities between private-sector companies and USG agencies; that is, which group has better or different capabilities for information visibility, acquisition, and analysis, relative to the other?\n4. Opportunities for collaboration between the USG and private sector. Given that these groups now exist in this ecosystem, what sort of collaboration makes sense going forward?\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews. The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.

CrowdStrike explained that part of what motivated the publication of their finding was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.”²\nSasha Romanosky is a Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation, a faculty member of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an affiliated faculty in the Program on Economics &amp; Privacy at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University.

In this joint statement, the USG claimed that it was “confident” that the breach was directed by “senior most officials” of the Russian government.3 Although the statement did not include any evidence or technical details, it was followed by a DHS/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Joint Analysis Report called “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” that offered technical details about the malicious tools.4 The GRIZZLYSTEPPE report, however, included a broad range of vague indicators, some not necessarily relevant to the DNC hack, and was widely criticized by the information security community as “sowing confusion about the hackers”” identities.5 In January 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration, the USG Intelligence Community (IC) released a coordinated report that situated the DNC breach as part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign.\nIn Congressional hearings, senior USG leaders were asked in detail about the methods they employed to arrive at their attribution. In response, former FBI director James Comey noted they could not offer details without revealing sensitive sources and methods, but explained that the FBI experts analyzed the forensic and other technical details provided by CrowdStrike (“we got the forensics from the pros that they hired”).6 Former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson added that “the DNC did not feel it needed DHS” assistance at that time “... they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike.”7\nThis case depicts a variety of dynamics emerging from the growth of private-sector firms that attribute malicious cyber incidents to nation-state actors, and how these capabilities interact with USG activities and interests. First, it speaks to the motivations behind publicly attributing a cyber incident, both for private companies as well as the USG. For example, CrowdStrike's attribution may have been intended to help other potential victims, but it also generated extensive media attention that raised CrowdStrike's public profile in a growing cyber threat marketplace. On the other hand, the USG must balance a range of interests in its public attribution, including its responsibilities for domestic cybersecurity, intelligence collection, deterrence in cyberspace, and an effective foreign policy. Second, attribution of the DNC breach demonstrates that there are opportunities for the USG to leverage private-sector capabilities, but also that there are risks with the government now not always having a preeminent role in this space. For example, CrowdStrike may have had the capabilities to disclose the breach months before the USG, and its attribution might have pressured the USG to offer its own attribution or otherwise respond to the\nRussians responsible. Third, in part because of its extensive cyber-forensics capabilities and direct access to the victim's network, a high-profile victim of a major nation-state actor (the DNC) relied on the capabilities of a private firm for assistance rather than the federal government. This raises the questions of who may have better capabilities and under which conditions would be able to collect information and associate an incident with an attacker. Fourth, perhaps in part because of the close connections between the FBI and CrowdStrike (the president of CrowdStrike Services is a former senior FBI official), the two entities participated in a valuable and growing form of public--private cooperation through CrowdStrike's sharing of forensic analysis.8\nEach of those four points, we argue, present emerging tensions, but also opportunities for the USG intelligence apparatus as it seeks to navigate and further understand its role, and the role of the private sector in cyberspace.\nTherefore, in this article, we seek to answer the following four questions: What is the purpose of attributing a cyber incident to a nation-state, or nation-sponsored individual or entity, both for the private sector and the USG?What are the risks and benefits of private-sector attribution of cyber incidents for the USG and its agencies, such as the IC and law enforcement?What are the relative capabilities for reaching high-confidence attributions between private companies and the USG?What opportunities exist for collaboration between these groups going forward?\nWhile this discussion is presented in the context of the USG (including the IC, law enforcement, network defense entities, and foreign policy community) these same issues can likely impact the governments of any country that confronts malicious cyber activity.\n## WHAT IS ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS?\nCyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and associated to an originating party (i.e. the attacker).9 Since the first rigorous threat intelligence report in 2013, which sought to attribute a collection of cyber intrusions of U.S. companies to the Chinese military, there has been a growing body of literature concerning the technical challenges of attributing a cyber incident to an individual or government entity.10 Other scholarship has addressed particular strategic, legal, and ethical issues that arise when entities seek to attribute cyber events.11 In addition, other scholars have discussed the international and\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 1. Attribution diagram. This Sankey flow diagram is a notional description of how pieces of information are combined to create various forms of attribution. We recognize that these information types are not exhaustive, nor always available during attribution. Further, the arrows suggest a strictly linear progression toward political attribution, which we recognize is not always the case. (Source: RAND).\npolitical challenges involved with attribution in regard to deterrence and delegation of cyber activity.[12]\nThe current state of affairs is complicated enough that there have even been numerous proposals to standardize attribution reports or even create new international or private-sector-led organizations whose mission is to attribute malicious cyber activity.[13] Others have also developed analytic models to help frame attribution procedures. For instance, the Diamond Model uses graph theory to formally characterize the distinct components of a cyber incident, and track any developments of those characteristics over time,[14] while the Q model takes a conceptual and strategic approach to help analysts better understand intrusion activity.[15] Lin distinguishes between three types of attribution, each requiring increasing forms and degrees of evidence: attribution to the machine, to the human, and to the party,[16] and Mejia proposes to decompose attribution into two parts: the act and the actor, arguing that these components are important to isolate and examine separately because they \"delineate responsibility\" and \"determine the appropriate response.\"[17]\nFor the purpose of this article, however, we consider two main types of attribution: technical and political, as shown in Figure 1. Technical attribution is the act of associating software, computer, or networking artifacts with a cyber incident. The body of evidence collected for technical attribution may include computer log entries, network traffic, malicious software (malware), file timestamps, or other modifications to computing hardware or software.\nAdditional evidence that can be brought to bear may include all-source intelligence, which can include signals intelligence (SIGINT) intercepted communications and human intelligence (HUMINT) from well-positioned human sources. In general, advanced SIGINT and HUMINT were historically only available to highly sophisticated nation-states; however, threat intelligence companies (and other nongovernmental organizations) are now developing their own capabilities that may rival nation-states'\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncapabilities.18 Open source intelligence based on publicly available information may also help in attribution. This type of evidence is available for all stakeholders and includes activities, such as surfing Darknet sites, leveraging publicly available websites, blogs, document repositories, and otherwise studying the behavior and tactics of cyber-threat actors. Together, these additional sources help achieve higher levels of attribution confidence.\nThe most challenging type of attribution, political attribution, requires understanding the geopolitical context and motives of potential attackers, such as information about the threat group's governance, financial, or reputational gains. Together, this information is incorporated in order to associate an incident or campaign to the particular threat actor—commonly referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT)—responsible for tasking, directing, or controlling the operation.19\nUnsurprisingly though, attribution is rarely a straightforward exercise. An investigator will likely not have all the necessary information, and even if they do, the evidence may be misleading. Technical indicators can be re-used, marred by incomplete data, false flag and deception trickery, and forensic difficulties.20 All-source intelligence may not be available or may provide conflicting evidence. Political attribution is also difficult since political motives are not always clear and can be purposely obscured to create confusion.21 For example, states regularly use proxy and nongovernment actors to conduct cyber operations, with these actors being directed, controlled, and monitored by official state authorities to varying degrees.22 The relevant government might be aware of these operations and thus might bear some legal or other responsibility to prevent them, but might also be able to create sufficient distance to muddy a judgment.23 Indeed, states might even benefit from the plausible deniability that these dynamics create—see, for example, Russian denials that they were responsible for the 2007 Estonian distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, claiming that these were patriotic hackers rather than officials acting on behalf of the Russian government. Last, political attribution might not ever be reached with analysis of a single incident and instead might require analyzing an incident in relation to other incidents leveraging similar tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs).\n## WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED CYBER INCIDENTS?\nNext, we examine what cyber attribution looks like, and who is making it. We do this by examining three sources of attribution information: the private sector, the USG, and an independently curated source of state-sponsored cyber incidents.\nAttribution by the Private Sector\nPrivate-sector companies have enjoyed an interesting and expansive evolution from providing simple information security services, like forensic investigation and incident response, to developing very sophisticated global intelligence and reporting capabilities.24 One of the consequences of competition in the threat intelligence space, and a reason that attribution has become a confusing matter, is that companies attribute incidents to different things. In some cases, the thing being attributed is malware (as in the case of trojans,25 remote access tools,26 or exploits27), or a particular attack (as in the case of botnet attacks or ransomware28), or campaigns of related attacks (as with a number of identified North Korean incidents by Group 123).29 Or it could be a nation-state, a state-sponsored entity, or a criminal group.30 For the purpose of this article, however, it is the latter group of threat actors (states, state-sponsored entities, and criminal groups), collectively referred to as APTs, with which we are mainly concerned.31\nThese APTs are differentiated from historic and simpler actors or malicious activity that may simply deface or DDoS a website, or crash a networking device. Instead, APTs are generally characterized by being deliberate in their choice of victims, using custom-built malware which may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, operate slowly and deliberately over months or years, and are able to adapt to an organization's network defense and hunt teams. Specifically, FireEye defines APTs as, “[D]istinct set of cyber tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are employed directly or indirectly by a nation-state or a sophisticated, professional criminal organization for cyber espionage or the long-term subversion of adversary networks.”32 Similarly, Kaspersky defines them as, “[C]oncerted, stealthy, ongoing attacks against specific organisations—in contrast to speculative, isolated, opportunistic incidents that make up the bulk of cybercriminal activity.”33\nAs described above, the general practice is to associate APTs to specific countries or state-sponsored groups (in addition to terrorist and criminal groups). For example, CrowdStrike takes a very adversary-based approach to attribution, stating that their “primary focus is to track adversaries associated with nation-state actors and monitor their activity,”34 and when naming threat groups, the intention is that the name “designates both the adversary's nation-state and the group they targeted.”35\nFurther, some companies seek to publicly call out specific individuals who allegedly carried out the cyber incident.36 For example, FireEye's Mandiant began this trend with its APT1 report describing Chinese exfiltration of corporate information from the United States, where it used a number of techniques to connect cyber activity with individual(s) from the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department, or Unit 61398.37 Not to be outdone, CrowdStrike sought to\nconnect the individual “cpyy” of PUTTER PANDA to the 12th Bureau of the 3rd Department of the GSD through “unintentional backgrounds in images of his dormitory and images of his office.”38\nOn the other hand, Cylance specifically does not focus on disclosing information about the humans conducting a cyber incident. As they state in Operation Cleaver,“[A]ll personally identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don't care who the adversary is, where they work or reside, who they're dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook—all we care about is preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.39”\nKaspersky very deliberately does not attribute those APT groups to any particular state actor or criminal group because of the potential for false or misleading indicators.40 However, they may sometimes refer to APT names used by other companies, which have been associated to nation-states.\n### How Many Named APTs are There?\nIt is difficult to know with much precision how many APT groups any given private company is tracking and when they were formally named. For example, CrowdStrike states privately that they track 133 distinct APTs groups,41 while FireEye claims to track thousands of threat actors,42 Google's Threat Analysis Group is tracking over 270 attacker groups,43 and Secureworks describes 66 unique threat groups.44 Yet not all reports are available to the public, and even when attribution reports are made public, in our experience corporate websites make it difficult to locate a complete list. By far, the most comprehensive source of information about the number of named APTs comes from the crowdsourced effort lead by Florian Roth (@cyb3rops),45 a cybersecurity expert in Germany, who has curated a list of named APTs. As of this article, he and his contributors have identified 141 unique APT groups across China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as shown in Figure 2.\nClearly, most (60%) of the identified groups have been attributed to China, with much smaller numbers of identified and named groups attributed to the other most active countries. The next best source of reported APTs comes out of Mitre's ATT&CK framework, which has identified 94 distinct APTs.46\nAttribution is also muddled because each company uses different naming conventions and often there are multiple names given to the same (suspected) threat groups. Again, the compilation of threat groups curated by Florian\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 2 APT groups  $(n = 141)$  (Source: Florian Roth).\nFigure 3. APT naming conventions. (Source: APT, \"Groups and Operations,\" http://apt.threattracking.com, accessed 10 November 2019).\nRoth identifies some of the conventions currently in use by prominent security firms, as shown in Figure 3.47\nFor example, FireEye takes a pragmatic approach to naming by appending an integer to the string, \"APT,\" as shown in Figure 4.\nOn the other hand, CrowdStrike has adopted animal monikers for its APT naming convention, as shown in Figure 5, where PANDA adversaries refer to Chinese threat actors, BEARS refer to Russia, KITTENS to Iran, TIGERS to India, CHOLLIMAs to North Korea, JACKALS to terrorist groups, and SPIDERS to criminal groups.\nCisco Talos, on the other hand, uses \"Group,\" followed by an integer number for their APT naming convention, and uses common nouns when naming criminal campaigns, as with COINHOARDER.48 Secureworks uses metals (Gold, Bronze, Iron, Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt).49 And finally, while reports are not publicly available, Accenture iDefense uses fish-themed names such as, SNAKEMACKEREL, JACKMACKEREL, and SANDFISH.50\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 4. Example of FireEye APT naming (Source: FireEye. See FireEye M-Trends, 2019.).\nFigure 5. CrowdStrike APT naming (Source: CrowdStrike. See Crowdstrike 2018 Global Threat Report, https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreat Report.pdf, accessed 26 May 2020).\nAnother reason that attribution is messy is that the same threat actor can be known by multiple names across threat intelligence companies. For example, APT28 (FireEye) is also known as FANCY BEAR (CrowdStrike), TG-4127 (Secureworks), and Group 74 (Cisco Talos). CHARMING KITTEN (CrowdStrike) is also known as APT33 (FireEye) and Group 83 (Cisco Talos). GOTHIC PANDA (CrowdStrike) is also known as TG-0110 (Secureworks), APT3 (FireEye), BUCKEYE (Symantec), and Group 6 (Cisco Talos), while other APTs may go by as many as ten different names.\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nThreat Reports\nGenerally speaking, the threat reports by the private companies we examined include a number of important sections. First, they identify the named APT group, its motives, and details concerning known targets. For example, the APT37 article from FireEye mentions that this group is a “suspected North Korean cyber espionage group” whose “primary mission is covert intelligence-gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political, and economic interests,” and that it has targeted “South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector.”51 Similarly, FireEye describes APT28 (aka FANCY BEAR) as a “suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor” that has conducted operations “in support of Russian strategic interests” by targeting “entities in the U.S. Europe and countries in the former Soviet Union, including government and militaries, defense attaches[sic], media entities and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government.”52\nIn addition, the reports provide information about known attack vectors, command and control structures, and specific vulnerabilities or custom malware used or developed during exploit. For example, reports may cite phishing (or spear-phishing) campaigns that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities launched from compromised servers, whose purpose is to infiltrate an organization and exfiltrate corporate documents (see APT28, APT37).\nTimelines of observed activity are also often carefully documented in many reports. For example, Secureworks captured the time of day events of BRONZE UNION (aka TG-3390) infiltrating a victim, as shown in the top and bottom panels in Figure 6.\nFinally, some reports provide a level of confidence and justification for attributing particular incidents to a threat group. For example, FireEye asserts that “we assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government,” which they base on “targeting profile,” “malware development,” and “probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer.”53 Similarly, CrowdStrike bases attribution, in part, on patterns of life, stating that “[t]hese actors are rational and generally predictable. ... They tend to work normal business hours in their local time zone with few exceptions, and they don't typically work on weekends.”54 Kaspersky writes in one report, “Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). The tools found in this campaign ... are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. ... Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.”55\n##\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 6. Timeline of BRONZE UNION activity (images by the author based on data from SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit Intelligence, \"Threat Group 3390 Cyberespionage,\" https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage, accessed 10 November 2019). The top panel shows time stamps for a single infiltration, while the bottom panel depicts intensity of malicious activity according to time of day (as measured along a 24-hour clock), day of week (inner to outer circle), and intensity increasing in color depth.\n# Attribution by the USG\nIn the U.S. context, the 2016 Presidential Policy Directive 41, \"United States Cyber Incident Coordination,\" designates the FBI as the lead to conduct \"threat response\" activities including providing attribution.[56] The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center and with analysis provided by the full IC, is the lead on providing intelligence support. Other agencies, especially DHS, might also provide evidence or analysis that assists the USG in reaching attribution. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, has authority to attribute and sanction an entity for malicious cyber activity as part of Executive Order 13694.[57] Attribution findings might be reached at various degrees of analytic confidence based on the type, extent, and significance of available evidence.[58] The United States'\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\ndifferent bodies might not assess evidence the same way and might disagree about attribution or confidence standards.\nOnce an attribution is reached, there is a secondary policy question of whether to publicly disclose the finding, and if so, in what form. In many cases, there have been leaks from USG officials, statements from Congress, or other press reports that an attribution finding has been internally reached, even though the USG has not offered an official public statement. In the relatively rare cases where the government makes a public attribution, these have come in a variety of forms: high-level public statements, technical releases, intelligence assessments, and criminal indictments.\nIt should be noted that we do not assume that attribution by the USG (or any federal government, for that matter) is a perfectly calculated action with complete agreement by federal components and agencies. Indeed, conversations with former officials suggest that decisions to publicly attribute are fraught with political tensions and internal debates.\nBy our count, there have only been 22 official USG statements identifying actors affiliated with nation-states for their cyber activity targeting U.S. persons or business, as shown in Figure 7.\nThese data suggest that the frequency of public attribution by the USG is increasing in time. However, the USG has not taken a standardized approach to attribution—either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type or extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures. For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, those appear to be the sole cases of international collaboration.\nFurther, a number of the attribution statements explicitly reference the work of the private sector in supporting the attribution. For instance, the June 2017 DHS Technical Alert attributing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's DDoS Botnet Infrastructure references the work of private-sector companies IBM, Symantec, and Novetta, among others. In fact, for incidents involving private-sector companies (for which the USG has no immediate visibility), it may likely require collaboration and information from the private sector in order to produce an attribution statement (we discuss collaboration in detail below).\nStatements by the USG focus on the behaviors of the nation-states or offending individuals and incidents, rather than creating crafty naming schemes of APTs. For example, the documents from the Department of Justice (complaints and indictments) include extremely detailed information about the defendants and their affiliation (employment), a complete history of the defendants' TTPs, the outcome of their cyber activity, and the alleged criminal violations. For example, in the case of the indictment against seven\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 7. Timeline of USG attribution of cyber incidents (Source: RAND).\nIranians for committing DDoS attacks against companies in the United States from 2011 to 2013, the indictment includes two counts of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer.[59]\nThe attribution reports from US-CERT, on the other hand, refer to specific incidents, such as ransomware, or attacks against critical infrastructure, and therefore do not require attribution. The reports may include much of the same information as any private-sector threat report, by including indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs, as well as any information US-CERT has regarding impact and remediation measures. For example, recommendations from US-CERT for avoiding harm from the WannaCry ransomware attack include applying appropriate patches, ensuring antivirus software is up to date and functioning properly, and testing one's backups.[60]\nNow, to be clear, the variation in reporting style and content can largely be explained by the mission of the attributing agency. While the private sector may be thought of as a singular entity with similar interests, USG agency attribution is related to the purpose of the attributing agency.\n# Nation-State Attribution Data\nWhile there are many reports describing individual attribution notices,[61] the most complete dataset of nation-state incidents comes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which has collected a sample of over 300 observations of \"publicly known state-sponsored incidents.\"[62] Note that the CFR dataset only contains observations, \"in which the perpetrator ... is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state. The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests.\"[63]\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 8. Cyber incidents over time (n=418), and top nation-states (n=319) (Source: CFR).\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 8, the number of incidents increased steadily from 2005 to 2019. One explanation for the dramatic increase is the growing ubiquity, complexity, and opportunities that have arisen because of adoption of electronic devices and opportunities to exploit them. Another possible explanation is that it has become easier to detect these events. We are unable to separately distinguish the two factors because, while it is certainly the case that attacker capabilities have increased over the past decade, so too have defender capabilities.\nThe right panel of Figure 8 shows the countries to which cyber incidents are most commonly attributed in the CFR dataset: China (150), Russia (92), Iran (43), and North Korea (34). These data show that, while China has been most commonly attributed, Russia has seen the largest increase in incident attribution over the past five years. The sharp decline involving reported Chinese espionage activity is likely a result of the Obama-Xi agreement in which both countries agreed to stop conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, although this decline was short lived.[64] On the other hand, the steady rise of Russian activity is consistent with reports of Russia's growing ability and interest to use cyber capabilities as a foreign policy tool, although reported events declined sharply in 2019.[65]\nOn the other hand, Figure 9 (left panel) shows the impact (outcome) of the events, and illustrates how the bulk of attribution has been against espionage activity, which is most often attributed to China and Russia (right panel).\nThese results suggest that espionage has emerged as the most predominant form of cyber activity (mostly committed by China and Russia), and that North Korea and Russia engage in almost all forms of malicious cyber activity (of the forms recorded by this dataset).\nNow that we have highlighted some of the complexities and tensions associated with attribution, and described the landscape of publicly available attribution reports, we next present results from interviewing cyber attribution experts.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPRIVATE-SECTOR ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER INCIDENTS\nFigure 9. Impact of incidents  $(n = 398)$ , by attributed country  $(n = 304)$  (Source: CFR).\n# EXPERT INTERVIEWS\nIn order to better understand the significance that the growing capability of private-sector attribution may have for the USG, we performed qualitative research by interviewing fifteen senior subject matter experts to explore four main topics:\n\nFormally, we performed thematic analysis based on semistructured interviews in order to identify the strongest and most common themes that emerged from the interviews.[66] The purpose of thematic analysis is to achieve thematic saturation—the point at which collecting additional data reveals no new insights. Our selection criteria for participants was based on domain expertise (e.g., cyber threat intelligence, cyber policy, or cyber law), and stakeholder organization (IC, law enforcement, academic/think tank, or private-sector threat intelligence company). In many cases, individuals had experience across multiple organizations; for example, many private-sector\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 34, NUMBER 3\nparticipants were former FBI or IC employees. All participants were senior career technology, government, or policy professionals.67\nNote that this section represents the thoughts and comments of the participants of this study, and does not reflect the opinions of the authors of this article or our affiliations.\n### Purpose of Attribution\nUnsurprisingly, participants acknowledged that private firms publicly attribute, in part, to demonstrate the competence of the company, to raise its profile, and develop additional business opportunities. Participants offered examples of public attribution, such as Mandiant's APT1 report and CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC attacks, that each, in their view, significantly increased the public prominence of those companies.\nHowever, the most widespread view by participants was that private firms conduct public attribution to call attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and thereby help prepare and inform the broader community of network defenders (for instance, CrowdStrike's stated purpose for publicly attribution of the DNC hack was to “help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers”).68 Public attribution of specific incidents, it was mentioned, can help the broader cybersecurity community better understand state-sponsored campaigns and actor-groups, which then assists network defenders in preventing future attacks.\nOn the other hand, participants described how the USG has its own reasons for publicly attributing a malicious cyber incident, some of which align with private-sector goals. The most commonly stated motive for USG attribution was to promote deterrence in cyberspace. Participants noted that public attribution is an important component of deterrence for multiple reasons. First, they felt that public attribution helps deterrence by denial by sharing information that can help build more effective cyber defenses. Public attribution, it was argued, helps draw attention to these technical indicator releases and raises awareness of cybersecurity threat actors, vectors, and mitigation strategies. Second, participants described how public attribution is a prerequisite for economic sanctions or criminal indictments (e.g. the Chinese and Russian indictments to cyber activity). In these cases, public attribution is a preliminary and necessary piece of USG efforts to punish actors for their conduct. Although naming and shaming was sometimes mentioned as a goal of public attribution, participants did not think that public USG attribution alone imposes real costs.\nIn addition to deterrence, participants also noted that USG attribution may help build international consensus on what constitutes irresponsible or inappropriate behavior in cyberspace (e.g. norms-building). As more\ncountries come to agreement on the red-lines regarding state cyber conduct, they will be better able to coordinate and impose collective punitive action.\n### Benefits and Risks of Private-Sector Attribution\n### Benefits\nOverall, participants felt that private-sector attribution was beneficial for the USG because it leveraged the private sector's technical capabilities, thereby helping the USG by corroborating or validating their own public attribution, lending further credibility to any public statements.69 A number of participants also mentioned that private-sector attribution would help the USG avoid having to give up sources and methods by disclosing IOCs, TTPs, or other details publicly. And one participant mentioned how private attribution can bring together alliances (Five Eyes [FVEY]), and particularly, more than just attribution, it becomes the process of attribution that helps develop these relationships (as was likely the case with the FVEY reports of the WannaCry attack).70\nOn the other hand, one participant was much less optimistic about private-sector (or any kind of strong technical) attribution. While not a risk, per se, the participant mentioned that even if the USG or private sector could provide all the necessary information in a report, it would likely not matter because nations and their governments respond “politically, not factually.” The thinking was that the USG need not convince those who will not listen to the United States anyway, and so it becomes futile to disclose more information.\n### Risks\nParticipants cited numerous risks to the USG from private-sector attribution. While public attribution can help corroborate the USG's message, it can similarly create confusion and uncertainty if the private sector contradicts it. For example, during the Sony data breach of 2014, some private individuals and companies cast doubt on the USG's announcement of North Korea's involvement, suggesting that it was instead caused by an insider.71 The disagreement within the private sector over the Olympic Destroyer attack (in which North Korea was initially thought to have been responsible, but later it was attributed to Russia) provides another example of how easily disputes can arise during attribution.72 One participant even critically mentioned that if the government was “more effective” at attributing cyber incidents, there would be less opportunity for confusion or conflicting statements.\nOverall, the risk of interfering with U.S. foreign policy was a major issue highlighted by a number of participants. One concern is that “attribution of malicious cyber activity to a state actor has foreign policy implications,” and\nif U.S.-based companies are viewed as having too close of a relationship with the USG, then any public attribution by these companies might be interpreted as official U.S. policy, thereby reducing the USG's ability to control its own message internationally.\nFurther, there were concerns from both USG and private-sector participants about interfering—either accidentally or intentionally—with an ongoing law enforcement, military, or IC operation. One participant from a private-sector company mentioned that they take precautions to avoid “tripping into” such situations and dutifully comply with government requests to stand down their investigation if it would jeopardize a USG operation.73 However, the same participant mentioned that the private sector does not (or should not) have the responsibility to “guess what the government is doing.”\nWhile not a risk to the USG, participants also described a particular risk to private-sector companies, when publicly outing threat actors. Participants suggested that private-sector attribution of cyber activities by a nation-state or criminal organization could produce unintended blowback for the company, or its employees.74\n### Comparing Attribution Capabilities between the Private Sector and USG\nParticipants were unanimous in the belief that there was no single agency or company that had universally superior capabilities, but that they each had unique strengths. For example, most thought that the private sector had greater visibility into domestic computing networks, as well as internationally because of the sensors installed on these networks. For example, FireEye claims to have information on “over half the Fortune 500 ... with devices in more than 67 countries worldwide,”75 and Secureworks claims to have 4,400 customers in 55 countries.76 It is this visibility and access, it was argued, that enables them to examine IOCs, and track strains of malware and APTs more quickly than USG.\nHowever, participants noted that U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement have their own advantages over private companies. First, only they, it was argued, could achieve the highest confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a particular nation's command and control entity. That is, only through their intelligence apparatus would they be able to assess the context and the “greater [political] purpose, motives, and directives of the adversary.” So, while most participants agreed that this kind of political attribution would be difficult for private-sector companies, one participant suggested quite strongly that because nation-state attribution is a foreign policy matter, it is not the role of the private sector to provide this level of resolution. Instead, it should be left to the government—that only it would\nhave insights into the direction and intent of an adversary, especially in light of deterrence messaging, and the potential for false flag operations.\n### Collaboration\nAll of the participants agreed that there was genuine value in collaboration between the USG and the private sector regarding public attribution. Participants noted that there is a great deal the USG can learn from private firms, including information about the cyber threat environment, the TTPs used by malicious cyber actors, and investigatory details and techniques that can help it conduct its own attribution investigations.\nHowever, participants noted that too close of a relationship poses risks to both the government and the private firm. The private sector also might bear reputational or other risks if they are seen as an arm of the USG, rather than an independent entity. In particular, business opportunities abroad might be hampered if there is a perception that the firm shares client or other valuable information with the USG. Too close of a collaboration might also play into a Chinese or Russian narrative that U.S. firms are really just extensions of USG policy.\nIt is also important to note that collaboration between the USG and private firms is currently facilitated by personal relationships. Many threat intelligence firms have been founded by or include senior representation from persons formally occupying senior government roles (e.g. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks). The former government officials who occupy senior roles in private firms will have an understanding of how government functions and how the private firm might be well positioned to assist.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this article, we differentiated between technical versus political attribution and discussed how the practice of cyber attribution is a complicated, inexact art, with many stakeholders and equities. We described the attribution statements by the USG and the private sector, and examined a dataset of known attribution incidents. In particular, we observed that, while the USG has attributed only a handful of cyber activity (22), the private sector is much more prolific in identifying, naming, and discussing in great detail the IOCs and TTPs of these threat groups. Now, this may be expected and appropriate—the USG has materially different interests and responsibilities compared with private companies, and it is not the role of the USG (or any federal government) to publicly expose every nation or state-sponsored group for malicious cyber activity. However, the growing private marketplace and prolific attribution from the private sector creates a sharp contrast with the federal government. In effect, “The actions of private firms here effectively\nusurp what had been previously the exclusive prerogative of the state in ways that are not easily evaluated.”77 One consequence of this may be that victims, media, and even foreign governments will increasingly look to private-sector companies for assistance and information, and not see the USG as a valuable resource of information, thereby sidelining the USG's role and prominence in attribution of cyber incidents. It also may potentially create the appearance that the USG lacks the ability or resources to conduct its own attribution investigations, and thus is not able to effectively deter nation-state actors. The private sector may further come to the belief that they can operate without USG assistance, and undertake increasingly aggressive (offensive) actions into adversarial networks in order to investigate and attribute incidents (see also the Defense Science Board,78 which advocates for increased authority for private-sector companies).\nThe increase in private and public organizations conducting cyber attribution, together with the ambiguity and difficulty in conducting proper cyber attribution, has led to a confusing state of affairs. These organizations do not operate with standardized (common) evidence collection and assessment practices. An attribution reached at high confidence by one company might not be assessed at the same confidence by another. This dynamic also applies to U.S. intelligence agencies that might have (healthy) disagreement about the strength and meaning of specific pieces of evidence. In addition, different organizations do not always distinguish whether they are attributing merely to machines, persons, or ultimate responsible parties. And if they attribute to a nation-state, they are not always clear about the extent to which the nation-state exercised direction and control over the operation, potentially even including delegation to non-state actors.79 On the other hand, some private companies have been resistant to attribute to ultimate responsible parties, while others appear to leverage them for maximal marketing and sales opportunities. The use of different naming conventions (e.g. FANCY BEAR, APT 28, SOFACY) further complicates the matter.\nSince motivations for attribution are never fully clear and may well be “loaded with political, instrumental, and strategic choices,”80 some argue that these incentives by private and public stakeholders may lead to a “skewed version of cyber conflict.”81 It is likely because of this confusion that volunteer and nonprofit efforts like Florian Roth's Google Doc, APTNotes, and the CFR's dataset have emerged to track and catalog the full scope of attributions and named APTs. Yet, despite these attempts, further efforts to standardize naming, style, and content of attribution reports is greatly needed.\n### What about Attribution of Cyber Incidents to the USG?\nIt is worth noting that U.S.-based threat intelligence companies avoid openly attributing cyber operations to the USG.82 However, the cyber operations\ntracker at CFR states that “[n]ineteen countries are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations, including the United States,” and that of the state-sponsored incidents, 22 were recorded as being sponsored at least in part, by the USG.83\nThere are several possible explanations for the small number of U.S. observations. The simplest but least likely is that the United States does not conduct as many cyber operations as its rivals. This is unlikely given U.S. investments in cyber operation capabilities and reports about U.S. cyberspace activity. A more plausible explanation is that the United States has been more stealthy with its operations than other states, and that it dedicates significant care and resources to not being caught. A third and complementary explanation is that most cyber attribution capabilities in the private sector are possessed by U.S. companies who either do not have sensors and visibility in foreign (adversarial) networks, or simply do not track USG operations. It is reasonable to think that U.S.-based firms do this out of respect for U.S. operations, patriotism, and in order to maintain a good working relationship with USG entities and agencies.\nIf these latter explanations (for the rarely attributed U.S. incidents) are true, then there is an important question about how long this will remain the case. We have described an environment of a growing set of capabilities in the private sector to attribute, and it is likely that these capabilities are not owned strictly by U.S. companies. Indeed, startup threat intelligence companies around the world might find that their profile would be significantly raised if they can credibly attribute operations to the United States. And so then, perhaps the USG should prepare for this kind of exposure.\n### Attribution for Deterrence?\nOne of the major benefits of attribution is to serve as a deterrent against future malicious activity. But public attribution of a cyber incident to a nation-state does not necessarily imply any further punitive response. In some cases, public attribution might serve to denounce or name-and-shame a responsible party in a way that could be costly. For example, law enforcement hopes that indictments will restrict life opportunities for the accused (e.g. jobs, travel). However, in other cases public attribution will not itself be the primary response and will precede other forms of cost-imposition, such as sanctions. Yet the benefits of an indictment are not universally shared. One commentator argued that, “as a substitute for other responses to serious cyber intrusions, indictments on balance signal weakness.”84\nTurning back to the CFR dataset, of the 65 cases for which a response by a nation-state was recorded, the action was predominantly a denouncement, as shown in Figure 10. Specifically, the left panel shows the responses (x axis) as a function of the top four offending countries (y axis), and highlights that\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\nFigure 10. Nation-state response to cyber incident (n = 65) (Source: CFR).\nChina, Iran, and Russia each received criminal charges; that North Korea and Russia were the only countries to receive sanctions; and that all countries received multiple denouncements.\nIn addition, the cross-tabulation in the right panel shows responses (x axis) as a function of type of incident (y axis). For example, this shows that denouncements were by far the most common kind of response, and issued for every type of incident. Together this suggests that while attribution (aka denouncement) is a relatively popular nation-state response, it is often not followed up with additional measures like sanctions.\n# Privacy and Safety Concerns\nAn emerging concern regarding attribution relates to individual privacy and safety. In this article, we touched briefly on potential risks that employees of threat intelligence firms face when conducting their investigations into APT activities. And at least one of the managers we interviewed would frequently check with their employees about concerns over traveling abroad because of their work.\nIn addition, the more threat intelligence reports that are produced with more complete information about the individuals behind the operations, one wonders whether this creates a harmful norm for retaliation by other countries that could endanger U.S. persons. Indeed, one commenter wrote, \"How will the United States respond when Russia and China and Iran start naming and indicting U.S. officials? ... The Shadow Brokers revealed the identities of specific NSA operators, so even if the National Security Agency is great at concealment as a matter of tradecraft that is no protection against an insider threat.\"85 We are not aware of any specific instance where a private-sector employee of a threat intelligence company was harmed as a result of their investigations or reporting, and we sincerely hope this does not become a reality.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nFurther, there may be legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of U.S. persons and businesses if a U.S. or foreign government entity were to conduct enhanced surveillance in an effort to detect and attribute malicious cyber activity on privately owned networks. Certainly this is a complicated issue that will not be resolved by this article. We merely wish to maintain awareness in order to promote transparency.\n### Intelligence Gain/Loss\nAnother concern raised during our interviews was the risks of tipping off an adversary with a threat report. This speaks to the familiar issue of intelligence gain/loss (IGL), and the practice of publicly calling out powerful adversaries for their malicious activity is not without careful consideration and deliberation. For example, Mandiant justified their 2013 APT1 report with:“It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.86”\nFurther, Cylance writes“We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world's physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.87”\nIn effect, these firms are recognizing that, while public disclosure of adversary TTPs may cause them to abandon ongoing operations and change their practices, those risks are outweighed by the benefit of exposing the activities. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be sufficient information available that could be used to fully answer the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses. If there ever are formal efforts to standardize attribution indicators (IOCs) and reports, they should also include recommendations for assessing IGL.\n##\nSASHA ROMANOSKY AND BENJAMIN BOUDREAUX\n# CONCLUSION\nAfter analysis and reflection, we believe that the private sector provides valuable capabilities that augment and support USG interests regarding investigation and attribution of malicious cyber activity. The capabilities and reach of the private sector are obviously strong and broad, and they offer additional information and insights that can bolster existing USG capabilities to detect and manage nation-state and criminal threats.\nSpecifically, there are opportunities for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors that can (and should) leverage personal relationships between former colleagues. And there may be more opportunities for more formal, structured, or frequent interactions. However, as was mentioned during our interviews, a collaboration that is too close or structured could well backfire. So careful and thoughtful, but deliberate, interactions will likely produce the best results for detecting and managing malicious cyber activity directed toward U.S. persons and businesses.\nThis research was sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center.
