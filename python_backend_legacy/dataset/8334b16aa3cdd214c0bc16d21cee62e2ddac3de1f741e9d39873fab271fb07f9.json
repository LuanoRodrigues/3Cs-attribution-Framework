I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\n\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\n\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense",

In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\n\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\n\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\n\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\n\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies",

The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\n\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\n\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\n\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as",

That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\n\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\n\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\n\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination",

In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\n\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\n\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of",

This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\n\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\n\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\n\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1.

The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\n\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\n\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\n\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\n\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\n\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.",

            "markdown": "Legal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\n\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\n\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\n\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv",

Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\n\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\n\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to",

This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\n\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\n\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\n\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-",

While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\n\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\n\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.",

            "markdown": "Socio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\n\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\n\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\n\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe.

While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\n\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\n\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future.",

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future.",

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future.",

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future."

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49. The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms. This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers. Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack. This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective. In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted. It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware. Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices. In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor. Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future."

I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation.\nIn 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1\nWhat was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense\npolicy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks.\nMy answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents.\nSecond, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense.\nFinally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations.\nThe purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.\n## Japan's Cyber Defense Strategy and Passive Defense\nGiven that until 2010, none of Japan's annual defense white papers had contained reference to cyberspace,^{7} the evolution of its strategy is impressive. Change came quickly as cybersecurity began to affect all aspects of citizens' everyday lives. Maturation of cyber strategy accompanied a broad coverage of all things digital under a national security framework. The concept of Society 5.0, a government initiative to create a new social contract and economic model by way of technological innovations, has spurred the government move toward a systematic integration of digital technologies\nto enhance economic growth and solutions to social challenges.^{8} The latest Cybersecurity Strategy of 2018 put forward three approaches: (1) enable socioeconomic vitality and sustainable development, (2) build a safe and secure society, and (3) contribute to the international community and Japan's national security.^{9} The three-pronged approach mobilized all national resources Japan has to incorporate the private sector and non-state actors in the whole-of-government framework to shape a business-friendly digital environment and combat cybercrimes. The framework is consistent with a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity advocated by leading Japanese academics, including Motohiro Tsuchiya.^{10} In one of his latest works on the topic, Tsuchiya highlights the growing role of intelligence in cybersecurity to stress the need to reduce the trade-off between national security and civil rights in the areas of telecommunications interception, protection of secrecy and whistleblowers, and revamping of security clearance systems.^{11}\nOne of the best ways to analyze the complex policy dynamics is to use Andrew Oros's two-part approach.^{12} One part is how changes in the international environment lead to changes in domestic decision-making. This dynamics involves the realignment of political party process caused by external changes to advance party agenda, leading to changes in security policies, institutions, and practices. In cyberspace, this equals the formation of a strategy through the enactment of anticrime laws and organizational adjustment to better address malicious cyber actions. In other words, the growing uncertainty and complexity in cyberspace characterized by the rise of hostile states and non-state actors has influenced the way the Japanese government makes proper adaptation to illicit acts.\nThe other part of the framework has to do with the way the Japanese political system functions through the identification and appreciation of security environment. This process hinges on the role of appropriate security actions in the policy-making process that attracts broad support base in the population.^{13} This is reflected, for example, in both 2015 and 2018 versions of Cybersecurity Strategy, which named, among other things, the rule of law and dialogue with international partners as part of a comprehensive package.^{14} In particular, the 2018 version stated that Japan would “proactively contribute to discussions on the individual and specific applications of existing international law by strengthening its capabilities for defense, deterrence, and situational awareness.”^{15} As the international discourse on cyberspace behavior matures,^{16} global norms and institutional cooperation have added a key dimension to Japan's strategy, a development that Japanese scholars widely identify to be positive.^{17} In an important contribution to this topic, Wilhelm Vosse demonstrates that the government and digital industry have joined the global discourse on how international law extends to cyberspace, and strengthened confidence-building measures and intelligence exchange mechanisms through dialogue with countries in the European Union, NATO, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.^{18} In such multilateral settings as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace (GGE) and Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), Japan has agreed with other states that international law provides a general prohibition on the malicious use of cyber force, that international law prohibits states from digitally intervening in the internal affairs of others, and that cyber operations that interfere with states' domestic politics could qualify as violations of state sovereignty.^{19} As an upholder of international humanitarian law, Japan has sought to mitigate sufferings inseparable from war. It also abides by international human rights law, which posits that the same rights that people have offline must be protected online. In addition, Japan has ratified the 2001 Budapest Cybercrime Convention and therefore is bound by international law to incorporate in its legal system clauses on matters related to illegal access to computer networks (Article 2), data interference (Article 4), and system interference (Article 5), and cooperation with other states in investigating and prosecuting acts criminalized by the Convention (Articles 23--35).\nThere are, however, serious questions about how effective the international law approach has been as a means of deterring cyber attackers. International law extends institutions no effective mechanism to enforce law, verify state compliance with rules, or penalize violators, allowing states to liberally interpret the principles of cyberspace behavior, such as those of target distinction and proportionality. The institutions have proven even less effective against non-state attackers, such as individual hackers and hacktivists. The Japanese government is aware of the issues with international institutions,^{20} as\nthey leave significant trade-off consideration for the country. That is, while advocacy of norm discourse and international dialogue gives the image of Japan as a champion of global cooperation, it has done very little substantively to empower the country to deter cyber attacks. The most visible aspect of this challenge is that the international arrangement has largely failed to keep cyber attacks from heading Japan's way.\nAt the most fundamental level, Japan's cyber defense strategy is based on the Yoshida Doctrine. According to Paul Kallender and Christopher Hughes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a postwar strategic outlook “making for a minimalist orientation of national security policy and alliance commitments, constraints on military capabilities, and formal and informal domestic security institutions and prohibitions and norms limiting the usage of military power.” The operational centerpiece of the doctrine is the concept of denial defense, which has consistently shaped the way Japan's armed forces are organized and trained in the postwar era. Denial defense works by denying attacks through static defense (such actions as hardening networks and preventive controls) and reactive defense designed to limit damage through detective controls and remediation action. Under the doctrine of denial defense, the actions Japan takes to protect its cyberspace include setting up firewalls, security patches, software updates, monitoring, blocking, and redirecting intrusions, and using white-hat “ethical” hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities. All combined, these defensive actions, whether static or reactive, are best characterized by passive defense. But the term “passive defense” (and active defense) may mean different thing to different people. In this article, I follow Dorothy Denning and Bradley Strawser in defining passive cyber defense as little more than a defense to minimize the effectiveness of cyber threats against friendly forces and assets. In contrast, active cyber defense is a direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of such threats.\nPassive defense in cyberspace stands in stark contrast with the growth of “active defense,” a strategy that has shaped Japan's military structure in recent years. The concept of active defense is close to what Eric Heginbotham and Richard Samuels call active denial, a strategy that is “built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary and make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high.” Heginbotham and Samuels argue that active denial allows Japan to gain dispersion capability and mobility and to leverage its investment into air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era. The growth of naval and aerial power is particularly striking relative to the effort the country has made to address the gray-zone uncertainty with rivals in China and North Korea. In a separate work, Samuels shows how Japan's maritime and coastal defense capability has surged over the years to make law enforcement power more robust. The Coast Guard has become a fourth branch of defense force to help Tokyo project additional diplomatic influence. The conventional military development has served as a precursor to the recent move to assess the merit of developing missile strike capability for the next National Security Strategy. The growth of military capability is also documented in a growing number of academic works, including those of Jeffrey Hornung, who characterizes a key dimension of Japan's strategy toward China as “hard-hedging,” a strategic stance that emphasizes competitive policies that augment one's military capabilities and alignments with others. He shows how strategy has grown over the last decades; since 1972, Japan has moved from the policy of engagement toward a “soft” hedge -- a stance that stresses engagement and cooperative policies that cultivate ties with China -- before it evolved into a harder hedge. Japan has built capabilities and partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region to challenge China's freedom of action and undermine its rise. The development accompanies a long-term strategic expansion of security architecture across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean aimed to hedge against the rising China. In particular, the expanding partnership with China's neighbors has built upon existing security and economic networks with India and Australia through trade and investment. It has also reinvigorated the ongoing diplomatic effort with Southeast and South Asia in a comprehensive security and economic package.\nThe passiveness in Japan's cyber strategy is striking in comparison. It is evident in the relatively static nature of legal and bureaucratic overhaul that Japan has undertaken. To pick some of the most notable developments, in 1996 Japan set up the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination\nCenter (JPCERT/CC) for research and analysis of imminent threats in cyberspace. In 1999, the Diet passed the Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (Unauthorized Computer Access Law, or UCAL), followed by the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society, which established the IT Strategic Headquarters in the Prime Minister's Office to oversee protection of privacy and information sharing rights. The Dietn passed the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business to strengthen the system of accreditation of certification business and the distribution and information processes. Not to mention, the government established the National Security Council in 2013 with the mandate to offer strategic guidance to the Prime Minister on all issues of national security. More legislation came to make denial efforts robust; the Cybersecurity Basic Law (CBL) of 2014 set up the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) to enable it to enforce security guidelines, audit government agencies, and investigate breaches. It also established the Information Security Policy Council to coordinate policy with internal affairs, foreign affairs, trade and industry, and defense agencies.^{31} The government revised CBL in 2016 to empower the Information-technology Promotion Agency to nurture a “reliable IT society.”^{32} It also revised the Information Processing Promotion Act the same year to enhance national expertise on advising private businesses.^{33} In 2018, the government revealed the aforementioned strategy to galvanize the Internet of Things (IoT) through tax incentives for firms that increased productivity and security through investments in devices like sensors and robots. In 2020, the Yoshihide Suga administration vowed to establish a “digital agency,” a bureaucracy aimed to strengthen business infrastructure and cyber defense.^{34} Note that none of these developments gives explicit authority to Japanese officials to conduct active defense. Reform has been made within the existing framework consistent with the passive defense posture. In other words, Japan is trying to preserve its denial defense structure.\nPassive defense is the chosen path for at least two reasons. The first is its consistency with the spirit of senshu boei and the constitution that bans offensive military missions. Passive defense offers a legally and politically viable strategy that suits Japan's unique domestic political environment in ways that continue to win popular approval at home. Political pragmatism has allowed the government to justify investment into cyber defense as is, and it works both domestically and overseas. That is, passive defense upholds the principles of international law and promotes rules of cyberspace engagement, allowing Japanese leaders to stay in line with broader legal and normative standards.\nSecond, passive defense works well in the framework of the US--Japan alliance. Since the 2015 Japan--United States Security Consultative Committee (the 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting) issued a joint declaration on cyberspace cooperation, the United States and Japan have shared information on threats and capabilities, including the exchange of best practices on training and education, and cooperated to protect critical infrastructure and the digital services that their armed forces use. The 2019 2 + 2 affirmed that “a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 5 of the Japan--U.S. Security Treaty,”^{35} a key development that may allow both governments to adopt a collective defensive measure. Japan has sent delegates to observe the US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Storm III and IV exercises, and in 2016, JPCERT/CC and tNISC became active participants in Cyber Storm V.^{36} The alliance has helped Japan expand its foreign activities in cyber fields. Since 2015, Japan has participated in NATO's annual Cyber Coalition exercise and even managed to raise its status from an observer to a contributing participant in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Additional benefits include access to advanced IT services, technologies, and infrastructure of a massive cyber defense industry, which in turn nurtures interoperability and mutual confidence with US forces. This is critical because US companies account for a vast majority of commercial software and hardware necessary for boosting denial capability and offer services and products Japan needs to fix breaches quickly. The benefits outweigh the risk that breaches into US systems undermine Japan's and the risk that the alliance makes Japan likely to be involved in anti-US attacks. The alliance remains a key force-multiplier, which boosts information sharing both bilaterally and through public alert systems about technical details like indicators of compromise (IOC) and malware descriptions, attackers' IP addresses, domain names, and styles of\n#\nN. KATAGIRI\nattack. This is important because, from the infrastructure and software used in an attack, officials can gain clues about attackers' operational tempos, word usage in foreign languages, or language settings on computers used to write malware. This gives Japanese officials a broader strategic picture of aggressors' intent, capability, and operational patterns and plans.\nThe legal and bureaucratic development comes with a new status as a \"cyber power,\" a signal that Japan is projecting itself as a rising influence in cybersecurity. In the 2006 First National Strategy on Informational Security, the government claimed that it holds the position of growing responsibility for solving problems as the \"world's top runner (sic).\" In the next strategy in 2010, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) vowed that the country was ready to \"lead\" Asian countries in information assurance. In 2011, Japan made the list of top ten countries of \"cyber power index\" developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Booz Allen Hamilton. In 2013, ISPC celebrated the rollout of a \"Japan Model\" to boost cyber defense and lead the global discourse on cybersecurity. Academic scholars joined the fanfare, with Kallender and Hughes calling Japan a \"cyber power,\" after investigating its years-long investment into the defense industry. Japan was on track to tout its success in making adequate preparation for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics games before it was postponed. Most recently, in a 2020 Harvard report on National Cyber Power Index, Japan again made the list of top ten cyber powers.\n# Denial Failure, Threat Recognition, and Cyber Insurance\nEvidence points out reasons for us to be skeptical. In Figure 1, data from JPCERT/CC shows how many cyber attacks have stricken Japanese networks on the quarterly basis since 2014. The attacks include criminal attempts by both domestic and foreign entities; I use this data for this article because this is the best data we have publicly on cyber attacks specifically on Japanese networks. When we break down the quarterly numbers into daily average, the data shows that the daily average of attempts to hack Japanese networks is 49.[44] The methods used in those attacks include DDOS (distributed denial of service), phishing, and ransomware. Of the 49 daily attempts, the average of breaches (i.e. failure of Japan's defense) was 47.4. The average number of breaches per attempts makes the overall failure rate of  $96.8\\%$ , a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. Finally, the daily average of contained attacks, or the number of attacks that Japan managed to keep from spreading to other networks, was 27.3.\nThis means that Japanese systems have fairly successfully contained the spread of attacks they sustained at the daily average of  $58\\%$  (27.3/47.4), indicating that they are better at containing malware\nFigure 1. Reported cyber attacks on Japan 2014-2020. JPCERT/CC, Incident Handling Quarterly Report.\nASIAN SECURITY\n#\nspread once compromised than preventing the breaches. The most important point, however, is that the number of attempts has been largely steady over the years, if not growing incrementally since 2019. This suggests that, while passive defense has helped suppress a rise in the number of breaches, it is not deterring new attacks. Of course, analytical caution is necessary here; the fact that passive defense has failed to deter many attacks does not necessarily mean it has not deterred any. Passive defense often does not get the credit it deserves because when it deters an attack, the action is invisible and people assume that it was not responsible for the invisible effect. It remains true, however, that if passive defense had been working, it is likely that we would have seen a lower percentage of deterrence failure over time. In other words, even if passive defense may have deterred some, it has not done to the extent that we see a reduction in the number of attacks.\nThe attacks have compromised the networks of large firms like Mitsubishi Electric and Honda Motor Co. Major incidents on these firms grab news headlines for obvious reasons, but the real extent of damage on the Japanese corporate world is greater, because it is more extensive for smaller firms whose defense is weaker. Breaches into their networks are often unnoticed. Lacking resources and expertise, they have been attacked several times without knowledge and in ways that allow attackers to develop persistence. This vulnerability reflects a generally low level of cautiousness that these firms display. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 top managers of medium-to-small and large Japanese firms underscores the systemic underappreciation of threat environment. Figure 2 shows the low level of recognition of the need to take action to beef up defense among medium-to-small firms. Large firms do better, but the problem is that they hire small firms as subsidiaries through complex supply chains, so they are closely connected.\nFigure 3 indicates a low level of threat recognition. As high as  $60\\%$  of medium-to-small firms consider the chance of getting attacked either low, somewhat low, or do not know, contrary to nearly  $30\\%$  of large firms. When we combine data in Figures 2 and 3, we have a bleaker picture. That is, while a large number of small firms do not expect themselves to get attacked, a larger ratio of them thinks that they do not need to beef up defense. In sum, the data in the Figures indicates the widely recognized need for defense that is nevertheless met by the poverty of threat recognition and preparation for contingencies.\nThis assessment of cybersecurity reality is consistent with the alarmist view of experts. The cybersecurity consultancy LAC, for instance, warns that the supply chain networks of Japanese corporations are so dense that small firms will be the first target of cyber attacks before the attack quickly reaches the networks of larger firms.[46] This warning coheres with the view of Toshio Nawa, formerly in charge of message coding and transmission for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force and currently head of the Cyber Defense Institute. In a brutal critique of his former employer, he contends that the government \"is lagging significantly compared with other countries when it comes to correctly assessing cyberthreats at any given moment. The government's situational awareness on threats that are unfolding now or about to happen in the future is so low that the decision-making on the necessary\nFigure 2.

Specifically, he finds that the government has chronically underinvested in workforce training.48\nOne of the primary reasons for deterrence failure is the absence of active defense options. Deterrence requires Japan to credibly signal that it has both the capability and willingness to launch a punitive action to impose pain on attackers.[49] Drawn from the concept of deterrence via punishment, this approach posits that coercion requires the imposition of unacceptable damages in retaliation for the attack.[50] This approach differs from that of deterrence by denial, which seeks to deter hostile actions by making it infeasible for an aggressor to achieve its objective.[51] In this article, I adopt the deterrence-via-punishment approach in part because the broader literature of cybersecurity has increasingly adopted.[52] It is also consistent with some Japanese experts' view. For instance, Takahisa Kawaguchi explicitly calls on Japan to have a retaliatory capability for the purpose of deterring attacks; he goes as far as to say that Japan should \"practice preemptive actions in areas where deterrence does not work,\" that \"as soon as a sign of an attack is detected, vigilant and preemptive actions must be taken in response,\" and that \"credible retaliation and rational sanction against the adversary must also be imposed.\"[53]\nIn fact, there are some signs that Japan is considering active defense measures. In 2012, the government outsourced the development of offensive cyber capability to firms like Fujitsu to order a \"seek and destroy\" malware.[54] Since 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has run the so-called ACTIVE (Advanced Cyber Threats response InitiatiVE) program to set up honeypots in close cooperation with infrastructure services and antivirus vendors. The ACTIVE program has since helped remove malware from infected machines and blocked more infections by blacklisting command and control servers and by taking down malicious websites, leading to the overall reduction of the number of infected devices.[55] In 2019, furthermore, it was reported that Japan would begin to develop computer viruses to counter attacks and work with the private sector to develop malware software to enter targets' backdoor.[56] Japan's overall response, however, is highly muted. In fact, there is no evidence to date that Japan has never deployed active defense capability. The reason rests with three reasons, starting with a legal one.\nLegal Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe first obstacle is in the legal system. In the area of national defense, Japanese laws are known to work in “positive list” format, which allows officials to execute what is written but prohibits what is not. A practice widely recognized by scholars,^{57} this means that whoever fires an active defense measure must have legal permission in advance; without it, their actions can be illegal. The positive list practice becomes a problem when there is not enough clarity about the legality of active defense, starting with the constitution. Although the constitution does not define cyber attack as use of force and therefore not prohibit it in Article 9, it does not allow anyone to launch cyber attack because it has not explicitly authorized it. This is why, as of now, Japan's law enforcement treats cyber attacks as crimes instead of armed attacks until they are attributed to the military forces of another state. Accordingly, the constitution does not extend an explicit authorization to anyone to use the principle of self-defense as a reason to launch countermeasures. Furthermore, the constitution puts into question the legality of cyber “probing,” an act short of penetrating enemy defense, for the purpose of target surveillance. In Article 21, by prohibiting censorship and disclosure of telecommunications secrecy,^{58} the constitution presents a legal ground to treat cyber reconnaissance operations as illegal as signal intelligence.^{59} For this reason, Kawaguchi considers Article 21 more important than Article 9; “the secrecy of communication stipulated in Article 21 of the constitution (and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law) is more strictly interpreted and applied than in other developed countries, making it especially difficult for the government and telecommunications carriers to monitor packet communication.”^{60} This is why, although the MOD and SDF are authorized to monitor some wireless telecommunications, they are not authorized to do so on a vast body of wired digital information.\nIt is not the constitution, however, that presents the greatest hurdle to active defense; instead, it is the interlocking nature of the system that raises enough questions about the legality of countermeasures. More precisely, it is the multi-layered, entangling nature of existing judiciary practice that has removed the clarity of legal authorization to use countermeasures as a means of deterrence.^{61} It underscores the ambiguity of the penal code, a set of law enforcement rules enacted in 1907, which presents three conditions under which use of force is legal: (1) presence of imminent and illegal threat to the nation, (2) lack of appropriate alternative response, and (3) minimum necessary amount of force to be used (Articles 36 and 37). Like the constitution, the code does not define cyber attacks as use of force, even though they are constantly “imminent” (because they can occur any time), and presents any basis to conduct active defense. In fact, the code places heavy limits on a variety of cyberspace actions that Japan could otherwise take. In Article 168(2), as amended in 2011, the code punishes illegal production of computer virus, including attempts of unauthorized reproduction of digital signatures of public office. Article 233 extends penalty to those who damaged the credit of or obstructed private business by spreading false rumors on the internet. Article 234 protects commercial business by penalizing interference with computer operations. Finally, Article 246(2) punishes profit-makers who manipulate electromagnetic records on the acquisition and loss of property rights.^{62} Many types of active defense measures Japan would adopt are likely to involve some of the above items, making actions like hacking back and dye-packs likely illegal, especially hacking back operations conducted by private companies against cybercriminal infrastructure. The penal code alone places enough ground to reject most option of active defense.\nSimilarly, lack of specificity hinders the law of Self-Defense Forces (SDF), which spells out duties and restrictions on SDF operations. This is despite the recent organizational adjustments of SDF to cyberspace reality. SDF has, for instance, established the Cyber Defense Group (CDG) as a joint unit under the C4 (Command, Control, Communication and Computers) Systems Command to monitor communications networks. CDG personnel will increase from 220 to 290 by the year 2021. Spending on cyber affairs more than doubled between 2018 and 2019 from US$100 million to US$235 million. SDF has also built cyber defense units in each service branch of the ground, maritime, and aerial components in ways closely aligned with the CDG. However, because of the aforementioned “positiv\nlist” format, authorization is necessary for the government to deploy SDF. Yet SDF Law remains profoundly unclear about the conditions for force deployment, because it gives SDF no explicit authorization to carry out anything more than passive defense, leaving underspecified the way SDF would be permitted to conduct active cyber defense. The most that SDF is legally permitted to do is to conduct self-defensive kinetic attacks against armed forces of adversaries when the threshold of an armed attack is crossed. However, SDF Law provides no answer to what target the SDF is legally allowed to hit. It is in part because it does not say “whether cyber responses fall under the category of ‘use of force' or ‘use of weapons' for a defense operation.” A hint may be in Article 74 where the prime minister is authorized to order SDF deployed to deal with an imminent threat, but the threat is commonly understood to be kinetic, not digital. No part of SDF Law explicitly empowers SDF to conduct active defense against cyber attacks nor identifies conditions under which SDF would be deployed to counter cyber attacks. Furthermore, no part in the SDF Law empowers any CDG personnel to defend the government networks outside the MOD and that of critical infrastructure within the range of its current mission.\nStructural ambiguity essentially functions as a systematic ban on active defense operations in other parts of the legal system. The 1950 Radio Law penalizes those who transmit false messages by using communications facilities, broadly defined, to gain unfair advantage or inflict damage to other person (Article 106) and seek destruction through use of “violence” in violation of the constitution (Article 107). This law does little to keep foreign-based attackers from using force to undermine the communications systems in Japan, although it does discourage domestic actors, government officials included, from taking otherwise necessary action to protect the facilities. The 1984 Telecommunications Business Law punishes those who expose private communications being handled by authorized carriers (Article 179), obstruct telecommunications services (Article 180), and divulge the private information of people without authorization (Article 183). This law places a heavy burden on firms (and government officials working with them) contemplating to conduct active defense; Koichiro Hayashi and Yoshihiro Tagawa argue that the law, by clarifying telecommunications rules for service carriers, keeps non-telecom firms from using the network for unauthorized purposes. The 1999 Act on Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access (UCAL) bans computer-related crimes committed through acts of unauthorized computer access. Inapplicable to foreign attackers, it is a set of articles that work with the penal code in penalizing computer fraud and computer destruction. Because most perpetrators are individual hackers and hacking groups, it generates about 200 indictments a year. The 2001 “Provider Responsibility Act” places the heavy responsibility of “due diligence” on internet service providers (ISPs) by penalizing those that “knew that the infringement of the rights of others was caused by information distribution via said specified telecommunications.” The law discourages private firms from willingly assist in the malicious use of digital commons by third parties. It imposes a serious consequence on actors, including government officials, who launch a cyber attack because the attack is likely to go through routers owned by private firms. The 2003 Personal Information Protection Law requires telecommunications firms to clearly describe the purposes of using personal data (Article 15) and make public the purpose of use (Article 18), while it prohibits fraudulent collection and use of personal data (Article 17) and transfer of such data to third parties without consent (Article 23). This law makes it hard for the government to use private firms for intelligence collection purposes and allow them to conduct self-defensive cyber operations. Finally, the so-called “cyber punishment law” applies both to government officials and firms and penalizes those involved in manufacturing, possessing, and planting viruses for the purpose of operating them on people's devices.\nIn sum, the whole legal problem stifles active defense options in two ways. First, while domestic laws like these have powerful constraints on government activities and individual crimes, it hardly constrains cyber attacks launched by foreign actors. In other words, the laws may be effective against domestic hackers but not foreign ones. Many foreign hackers operate from countries without extradition treaties, such as China, Russia, and North Korea, so Japan's legal options against them are severely curtailed. As such, the legal system stands in ways that essentially condone foreign hackers to\nlaunch attacks toward Japanese networks, while keeping Japanese officials from using active defense to deter attackers. This problem becomes magnified by the problem of attribution, in which Japan would need to prove attackers' complicity to carry out active defense. This is important because, without proper substantiation of cyber attacks, even when Japanese firms were able to trace attacks to originators, foreign governments are always able to invoke plausible deniability to delegitimize Japanese claims.\nThe other problem is the lack of authority that officials need to have to grant private firms the right to launch active defense measures in self-defense situations. Through layers of aforementioned laws, officials retain a tight control over private businesses' conduct in cyberspace, in part because they fear, according to Hayashi and Tagawa, that if they let one firm conduct active defense, others would do the same against each other.^{72} This worry about digital chaos stands in contrast to the emerging practice outside Japan, especially countries in the Five-Eyes intelligence partnership.^{73} Elsewhere, experts have become more open to risks and opportunities to probe various options. In Japan's case, active defense would require legal reform. But there are three reasons why reform has been absent. First, a new law would have to specify conditions under which countermeasures will be carried out. However, to bind specific acts on a legal document is antithetic to the reality of cyberspace where strategic flexibility is often required -- cyber attacks continue to evolve. Second, reform would require lawmakers to revise all relevant laws, a bureaucratic nightmare that suppresses willingness for change. It would involve a number of government stakeholders, such as the National Police Agency (NPA), Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). This is because laws are administered by different agencies. For instance, the Telecommunications Business Law is administered under MIC while UCAL is in the NPA's realm. The seriousness of interagency friction should not be underestimated. Working across agencies to pass a new law would at least engender a significant temporal challenge; if at all, it would not be made fast enough to keep pace with attack method sophistication. Finally, there is no apparent public appetite for national security reform, especially cyber.^{74} A robust civil society and pacifist movement in the postwar period have played a pivotal role in constraining the government from drifting into aggressive national defense policy. The norm community has been so embedded in society that even Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving Prime Minister (2005--6, 2012--20) who advocated constitutional revisionism, failed to get the political process going and garner enough popular support to revise Article 9.^{75} The constitution's Article 96 stipulates that, to revise any part of it requires two thirds of votes in both chambers of the Diet and a national referendum to gain a majority, a hurdle never crossed in Japanese history. If no critical mass supported amending Article 9, it is unlikely that enough people would support authorizing what can look like a “hostile” strategy even for self-defense.\nOf course, officials are not sitting idly. They have slowly pushed Japan in the direction of so-called “cross-domain” operations -- operations that affect more than one domain (i.e. cyber and military domains) while keeping the change within the legal boundary.^{76} The 2018 version of the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) focuses on some of the most important conventional military threats Japan faces, such as those from North Korea, Russia, and China.^{77} Traditionally, NDPG has emphasized senshu boei as in other defense papers, but the latest version suggested that a combined use of cyber and military retaliation is permissible. Among other things, it stated that in case of an armed attack, Japan would consider retaliation using kinetic, space, and cyber means.^{78}\nHowever, close scrutiny reveals threes shortcomings with this arrangement. First, it does not promise a response to cyber attacks. Instead, it would only allow a mixed response to a military attack. In other words, it is not designed to deter cyber attacks. Second, by forcing Japan to wait to be attacked first, the arrangement falsely assumes that Japan would be able to retaliate after absorbing the first strike. Instead, a correct assumption should be that the first strike would remove Japan's ability to cyber-retaliate.^{79} Finally, for the SDF to synchronize operations between different domains and to do what it promises in the document, it would require revision to SDF Law to allow the establishment of a joint operations command or a permanent joint task force (JTF). This is because Article 22 of SDF Law would allow the government to set up JTFs only for specific missions (for example, for ballistic-\nssile defense missions). The legal reform, however, would be as cumbersome as I described above. While the strategic document seems to comply with provisions of the legal system, it has yet to be deemed as constitutional (or not). The latest strategic stance still comes with a severe restriction on the use of cyber force.\n## Technical Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe other obstacle is technical, centered on the need to communicate the message of deterrence to right audiences. Deterrence requires Japan to ensure that the adversary receives its message and understands the conditions under which it would launch punitive measures. However, receivers of deterrent messages may have trouble with doing so because messages are coded, internet traffic is heavy, and there is much “noise” in cyberspace. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan write that “even if a target state realizes it has been attacked, it is difficult to infer the intent behind a cyber signal based solely on an observed incursion.” This means that Japanese officials must make their message clearly communicated and act in consistent manner with the content of the message. Japan has two options to do so -- public and private communications with countries it seeks to dissuade. My analysis suggests that neither is easy.\nOn the one hand, Japan may opt to make public its threats to hackers in places like China and North Korea, declaring that it would fire punitive response to preemption, hoping that the “audiences” will get the message right and decide not to take action. Public communication is a good way to raise stakes, which is important because it increases audience costs, meaning that Japan would end up paying considerably if its threats go unheeded or if it fails to deliver the threats, so targets are likely to take the threat seriously. However, there are three problems with this process. First, it requires Japan to substantiate the damage of the initial attack that it sustained in order to make its action legitimate. To do so may Japan to reveal its capability and sensitive information, including the attack code used in the operation, when such information must be kept secret. While Japanese officials could deploy techniques like embedding unique signatures in the code to overcome the problem, they would still leave some trace of the operation on targets' network, meaning that the targets might be able to reuse and recycle the code in future operations. Second, public communication requires Japan to be willing to follow through the threat it issues, but the aforementioned legal problems make the follow-up action legally questionable and consequently make the threat less credible. This does not help deter attackers because it would allow them to simply ignore the threat. Alternative responses, such as indictments of foreign suspects and economic sanctions on individuals involved, could be costly; at the minimum, it would make Japan subject to retaliation. At a minimum, cyberspace escalation becomes likely, and worse, the heightened tension may as well spill over to other dimensions of international relations, including diplomatic, economic, and military.\nOn the other hand, Japan may seek to make threats of active defense privately, promising to retaliate against North Korean or Chinese attacks through diplomatic back-channels and crypto-messages in the attack code. Private communication may be effective because it permits bilateral communications in which no one else would know the negotiation, whether it succeeds or not, and in whose favor it ends up working. So actors are more likely to be willing to negotiate, and Japan can reassure them to quietly cease its attacks. The problem with private communication, however, is that attackers retain plausible deniability and face little incentive to admit wrongdoing because the whole thing is private. Private communication also involves the risk of getting outed by the attackers if they are not happy with the negotiation, which would embarrass Japan publicly. In other words, private communication gives Japan's adversaries a bargaining advantage. In sum, it is a risky move to threaten retaliation either publicly or privately. In both situations, escalation of cyberspace tension becomes likely.\nSocio-political Obstacle to Deterrence by Active Defense\nThe technical challenge is serious because it leads to a political one of how to control escalation when Japan launches active defense measures. It is because it is in the interest of the Japanese government to avoid public outrage.^{82} Deterrence by active defense rests with the issuance of credible threats that clarify conditions under which Japan would attack back at aggressors. Good attackers know that Japanese officials are both willing and capable to carry out threats they issue because they have a variety of techniques and network devices to hide methods of active defense measures. For example, they know that Japan is able to quietly launch a malicious code into their networks in ways that appear to exploit vulnerabilities when it actually exploits another. The code can carry out a few critical missions, including spreading false information within the network, changing data in the attacker's systems without the latter realizing that they are getting inaccurate data.^{83} Therefore, if Japan makes a declaratory policy to punish an attacker, the attacker would be pressed hard to take the message as genuine (and hostile) and vow retaliation. As such, Japanese officials expect attackers to adopt an aggressive strategy and prepare for preemptive strikes. The tit-for-tat calculus increases the chance of escalation, generating a cycle of reactions and counter-reactions that may lead to a cybersecurity dilemma.^{84}\nThis is a serious problem because the fear of escalation can make many people highly risk-averse. Increasingly aware of their vulnerability, many Japanese have reasons to oppose escalation, from ordinary citizens to bankers to insurers. For instance, the financial world is known to display aversion toward escalation of violence.^{85} Many Japanese firms have already seen their systems compromised. Services and retail industries tend to sympathize with the financial world because they are among the most targeted.^{86} Furthermore, they face the likelihood that insurance costs will rise as a result of escalation, a problem that would pose challenges to consumers and insurers alike. In part due to widespread vulnerabilities in the industries, ordinary citizens have experienced repeated data breaches and anxities about cyber insurance premiums. They rely on property and casualty insurers who have faced an increasing number of claims. Not surprisingly, many insurers have declined to pay major claims, such as the NotPetya incident of 2018, and instead invoked “war exclusions” to decline coverage for hostile action. Cyberspace escalation would upset a number of ordinary people not only financially but psychologically. Citizens have experienced a heavy mental toll in the form of frustration and financial worry.^{87} According to a 2017 government survey, Japanese people considered the internet space as the most “frightening” (sic) place, more frightening than places like commercial streets and parking lots. They also considered cybercrimes as the most frightening crimes, more frightening than financial frauds and burglaries.^{88} Victims often turn to their government to blame because it is hard to hold foreign attackers accountable.\nOpposition to active defense is a critical factor because it mounts a serious political challenge. As I discussed above, there is enough legal challenge with countermeasure options, which indicates a preexisting social foundation upon which grassroots movement may become a political opposition. Because it is hard to stop cyberspace escalation once it starts, people have enough reasons to feed extremist views on the debate when they exercise their rights to press governments. On the extreme side of the debate is the ideological left, represented by those who sympathize with the traditionally pacifist agenda of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and socialist members. JCP members and sympathizers have opposed a series of national security legislation for cybersecurity act, such as the Cybersecurity Basic Law, because they believe that they would allow Japan to operate with US forces more closely on cyber operations. They claim that, among other things, the United States has wrongfully treated cyber domain as a warfighting domain and that an expanded security alliance with the United States would draw Japan into unnecessary conflict. Seeing cyberspace escalation as the same as the militarization of it, they base their claim on the fact that the United States has preemptively (and allegedly illegally) conducted cyber attacks (i.e. NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden), possesses a strategy that unifies cyber operations with military ones, and conducts various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations on noncombatants across the globe. Furthermore,\nthey are concerned about the leak of Japanese IT companies' sensitive information to the United States when there is not enough protection extended to banking and retail sectors and not enough insurance coverage for victims of cyber fraud. While JCP and socialist advocates have long been pushed to the corner of Japanese political party dynamics, their views and influence across the Japanese society on the way legal decisions are made in the area of national security should not be underestimated. While these views have never become a majority view in Japan, the broader message of alarmism about aggressive strategy continues to resonate with the electorate.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that Japan's current defense system has not worked adequately to deter cyber attacks because of its heavy reliance on passive defense strategy. While passive defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them. Deterrence by punishment requires the use of active defense countermeasures, but they have not been the strategy of choice for legal and technical reasons. The challenges that Japan's legal system and technical difficulties pose have been tremendous; with bureaucratic reform made in recent years on the incremental basis, Japanese networks remain as vulnerable as before, consistently failing to curb the incoming hostility.\nGiven the high stakes to correct the course, reform may be forthcoming, albeit slowly. The legal reform is hard to sell to the Japanese public because it has significant bearings on domestic politics and constraints on the use of force at home and because the existing legal system is so embedded in the society. People in Japan have reasons to oppose government policy to adopt aggressive cyber strategy in a democratic process. On top of this, the technical challenges have proven themselves to be so complex that drastic change in policy may be difficult to achieve in the short period of time.\nCertainly, Japan's case presents an important case study for a broader subset of democratic nations confronted with the challenge of increasing digital hostility. Japan's example illustrates the difficulties of overcoming existing legal hurdles and technical constraints inherent in cyberspace. In this respect, this article serves as a reminder of the need to probe options of dealing with cyber attacks with deterrent threats. Even though the article spells a number of reasons for us to be skeptical about the drastic change in Japan's cyber defense strategy, it may encourage more studies on the topic to expand our research agenda in ways that may lead to additional insights about how cyber deterrence may work in the future."

    "abstract": "I investigate reasons why Japan does not use \"active-defense\" cyber strategy for the purpose of cyberspace deterrence. I show that the reason has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as \"denial defense,\" a strategic posture designed to deny attacks by defensive methods. I offer three reasons for this strategic choice. The first is the way the law works in Japan. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. All the reforms made in recent years to buttress Japan's cyber policy have been within the existing legal framework. The second reason is the enormous technical constraints that Japan face on the use of cyber force. The final reason has much to do with the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, reassuring the public, and controlling cyberspace escalation. In 2016, Japan's Ministry of Defense (MOD) realized that foreign agents had penetrated its communications network known as the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII). The DII was supposed to be more secure than private networks, many of which had been compromised elsewhere. It consisted of an external system linking the internet and an internal system that allowed defense officials to electronically communicate. Normally these systems were used separately, but officials were using them interchangeably when the hackers infiltrated. The initial point of attack was through computer networks at the National Defense Medical College, from where the attackers moved to penetrate the network of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). This was despite the fact that JGSDF had limited external connections to prevent precisely this kind of attack. Although the MOD denied the incident, news media pointed out that critical information about ground operations had been stolen within hours of attack.1 What was surprising about the incident was not the vulnerability of Japan's defense system but the absence of a “real” response to prevent further attacks.2 After locating the attack origin in China, the Japanese government decided against urging Beijing to stop or taking retaliatory strikes, and instead did what it had always done -- deny incidents and beef up defense. Japan's cautiousness was in stark contrast to the growing openness of Western governments to the option of countermeasures -- defined here as acts of proportionally responding to cyber attackers to compel them to desist -- measures that include honeypots to lure in attackers for observation and quarantine, “hacking-back” at the origin of attacks, and “dye-packs,” a malware in its networks' decoy file that traces attackers.3 Today, the contrast looks even more stark when we consider the fact that, while Japan is among many countries with the ability to launch cyber countermeasures,4 there is no record that it has ever used it. That creates a puzzle; if Japan is capable of attacking back to deter cyber attacks, why does it not use it? What makes it unwilling to use the power that others have used elsewhere? Is it because Japan's defense is simply weak? Probably not, because Japanese technocrats do have skills to operate as refined hackers. How about international legal restrictions? Not quite, because international law has little power to enforce rules on cyber retaliations. While there are many academic works on Japan's defense policy and capability, there has been a marked hole in the literature on Japan's cyber deterrence strategy. In fact, analysis of Japan's security policy, particularly one in the Western scholarship, has been so focused on the military aspects of it that the scholarship on Japan's cyber defense has been under-developed.^{5} In this paper, I seek to fill the void by explaining why Japan has been unwilling to launch countermeasures as a means of deterring cyber attacks. My answer to the puzzle consists of three dimensions. First, Japan's current defense system has not worked well to deter cyber attacks. Granted, cyber deterrence is known to be extremely hard, and Japan's case is no exception. Data shows that the average number of breaches per attempts on Japanese networks is extremely high at 96.8%, a near certainty that a cyber attacks would hit the target. The number of attack attempts has been mostly steady over the years, meaning that there is a constant flow of incoming attacks. In other words, while Japan's cyber defense strategy may be denying some illicit traffic, it is not deterring new attackers. Had the current strategy have been working, we would have seen an overall reduction of attack incidents. Second, the failure to deter cybercrimes has much to do with the passive nature of cyber strategy best characterized as “denial defense,” a strategic posture designed to deny foreign attacks by defensive methods. Denial defense centers on the use of “passive defense” actions to minimize damage, rather than “active defense” that involves attacking back. This is because Japan has spent decades building denial defense capability through new laws, organizational reform, government-wide training systems, and collaboration with the private sector. While denial defense is useful for rejecting hostile actions, it does little to deter them -- by imposing such costs on attackers that they cease operations. Instead, it is active defense that carries this retaliatory ability. The primary reason why Japan's cyber deterrence strategy has not worked well is because it has invested exclusively in passive defense. Finally, I point out three factors that keep Japan's cyber warriors from active defense operations. The first is the way the law works. The legal system, including the constitution, is the cornerstone of passive defense. Consistent with the postwar doctrine of defensive defense, or senshu boei,^{6} the existing legal system keeps cyber strategy strictly in line with passive defense. The legal constraint on active defense is buttressed by the second factor -- the enormous technical constraints that cyber warriors face on the use of force. The constraints come from the difficulty of sending credible threats to target audiences, which leads to the challenge of reassuring the public that they will not be attacked and controlling cyberspace escalation. In other words, the legal, technical, and socio-political hurdles are the reason why Japanese cyber strategy is stuck with passive defense operations. The purpose of this paper is not policy advocacy; I do not call for revision of the existing system to make way for active defense strategy. I do not assume that such revision ought to be made, either. Instead, my aim is analytical. I intend to critically assess a set of key factors that keep the counter-measure options off the table when they may be needed to deter criminal acts. I do so by presenting a detailed analysis of legal and technical challenges that are unique to Japanese context. In so doing, I combine the academic research on cybersecurity with the literature of Japanese defense policy as an intellectual source of inquiry. The analysis proceeds in five steps. First, I show how passive defense informs Japan's cyber strategy. Second, I present data to show why the current strategy has not worked adequately to deter attackers. Third, I explain how the legal system reinforces the status quo with passive defense. Fourth, I describe how technical challenges make it hard for the country to adopt active defense strategy. Finally, I conclude.",
