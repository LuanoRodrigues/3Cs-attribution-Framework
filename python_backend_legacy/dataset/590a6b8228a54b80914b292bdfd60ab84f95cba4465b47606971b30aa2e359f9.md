Westphal*\n## ABSTRACT\nCurrently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective\n* J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents\nI.

INTRODUCTION\nOn August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n1.

Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby\n16.

BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n39.

Defining Cyber-Attack\nIn addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n49.

Cyber-Attacks Versus Kinetic Attacks\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62\nCyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially\n55. See infra Section II.B. When information security personnel are discussing attribution, they are often referring to who conducted the cyber-attack. See Kristen E. Eichensehr, The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA L. REV. 520, 524 (2020). Throughout this Comment, attribution also refers to non-State actors’ conduct being attributed to State actors.\n56.

International Law Standards for Legal Attribution\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³\nThe ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷\nFurthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must . . . be shown that this ‘effective control’ was\n119.

Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴\nBecause the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶\nIn 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷ . . . agreed in a consensus report . . . that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n129.

International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n139. *Id.*\n140.

ANALYSIS\nThe existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸\nThe hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰\n## A.

State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests.

Applying the Effective Control Test\nAssuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and\n218.

Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions\nAlthough the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴\nNotably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n229. See Tran, supra note 156, at 376.\n230. See Margulies, supra note 60, at 514.\n231. See id. at 514–15; see also Jane Perlez, Tribunal Rejects Beijing’s Claims in South China Sea, N.Y.

In response to the tribunal’s decision, China’s Foreign Ministry described the decision as “invalid and has no binding force,” and “China does not accept or recognize [the decision].” Id. In reality, China’s actions in the South China Sea are plainly inconsistent with the Law of the Sea, which China is a party to. See id. Accordingly, Margulies’s expectation of bad-faith States’ willingness to voluntary cooperate in potentially adverse rulings may be overly optimistic.\n232. See U.N. Charter art. 51 (“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”).\n233.

First, *in camera* and *ex parte* proceedings would require unprecedented levels of States’ consent.²³⁸ For example, accused States must consent to an application of the VCT and to be bound by a judgement based on evidence that the State cannot examine or refute.²³⁹ Second, victim States would need to turn over evidence, gathered by secretive means, to a factfinder, whose system cannot be assumed to be free of cyber intruders.²⁴⁰ Third, the cyber attribution problem cannot be characterized as a red herring;²⁴¹ a new standard that fails to consider the nuances of the cyber domain repeats the issues resulting from applying kinetic standards to cyber operations.²⁴²\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test\nThis Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show\n238. See Perlez, *supra* note 231 (reporting on China’s decision to not give an adverse international decision legitimacy by not participating in it).\n239. See Tran, *supra* note 156, at 424 (suggesting cyber attribution factfinders should use *in camera* and *ex parte* proceedings).\n240. See *id.* at 426. Regardless of the standard being applied, victim States hoping to legally attribute an operation will need to disclose secrets; a standard that assumes the factfinder’s network would be completely secure forgets a fundamental canon of cybersecurity: no system is truly secure, there are only degrees of security. See Nicole Perlroth &amp; Scott Shane, *In Baltimore and Beyond, a Stolen N.S.A. Tool Wreaks Havoc*, N.Y.

See Rid &amp; Buchanan, *supra* note 70, at 4 (looking at the technical and tactical levels of a cyber operation to glean attribution information). The CECT includes a State action element because passive enablement or sanctioning the presence of attackers creates too many issues. See Ashley S. Deeks, “*Unwilling or Unable*”: *Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense*, 52 VA. J.

Tactical and Technical Enablement\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰\nTechnical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n246. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A, Appeal Judgment, ¶ 122 (Int'l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia July 15, 1999).\n247. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4.\n248. See Perlroth &amp; Shane, supra note 240 (highlighting the consequences of the Shadow Brokers, an elusive hacking group, leaking the N.S.A.'s EternalBlue hacking tool, including, North Korea, Russia, and China using the tool in cyber operations). This Comment does not wade into the issue of whether the United States should be liable for the damage that its leaked tools cause.\n249. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17 (discussing the importance of analyzing a cyber operation's target). Using a zero-day exploit does not violate international law. See David A. Wallace et al., Peeling Back the Onion of Cyber Espionage After Tallinn 2.0, 78 Md. L. Rev. 205, 221–24 (explaining the Tallinn Manual's experts' conclusions on whether cyber espionage violates international law in peacetime and wartime circumstances). Notably, low-impact cyber operations occur in the \"cyber gray zone\" and may include zero days. See Schmitt, \"Virtual\" Disenfranchisement, supra note 75, at 30 (categorizing operations in the cyber gray zone as operations that do rise to the level of a use of force or an armed attack). Essentially, this Comment argues that enabling a cyber operation, via a damage-enabling zero-day exploit, should be considered in the CECT's analysis, regardless of the operation's IHL categorization.\n250. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17–18 (explaining that “infrastructure is required for most malicious activities”). For example, DDoS attacks rely on infected machines, bots, as the infrastructure (means) to launch the attack. A perpetrator’s reuse of infrastructure aids the attribution process in ways similar to footprints at a crime scene. See id; see also Trickbot: U.S. Court Order Hits Botnet’s Infrastructure, SYMANTEC (Oct. 12, 2020), https://bit.ly/39nj3hD (detailing a takedown operation that targeted the Trickbot botnet, one of the largest and problematic botnets in recent years).\n251. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 10 (referring to the technical aspects of an attack as \"the how\"). Thus, in this Comment, technical enablement refers to a State enabling a non-State actor with information on how to conduct a cyber operation or how to manipulate a target's weaknesses.\n252.

(May 19, 2014), https://bit.ly/3boiDtO (explaining the debate of disclosing zero-day vulnerabilities or weaponizing them).\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n837\nnot include situations where a State discloses a zero-day vulnerability to a software developer or security researchers.²⁵³ Technical enablement could be implied when showing tactical enablement if the State provides tactical means, which includes technical information within it.²⁵⁴ Tactical enablement refers to States providing the means used for the operation.²⁵⁵ Providing the means for a cyber operation could refer to funding and organizing the perpetrators or it could refer to the transfer of command-and-control servers. Furthermore, creating the means for an operation could refer to the creation of custom malware to exploit a certain target.²⁵⁶ For example, a State could enter an adversary’s network,²⁵⁷ map that network,²⁵⁸ and create custom malware specifically designed to compromise that network or the infrastructure it oversees.²⁵⁹ Transferring that malware or the means to control it once it infects the target could satisfy tactical enablement.\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in\n253. See id.\n254. For example, the Tartarus malware in the hypothetical included a damage-enabling exploit. See supra Section III.A.\n255.

See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 53, at 193 (defining cyber espionage as “any act undertaken clandestinely or under false pretenses that uses cyber capabilities to gather (or attempt to gather) information with the intention of communicating it to the opposing party”). Therefore, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, mapping a network in peacetime would not violate international law. See Wallace et al., supra note 249, at 221–24 (explaining the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s experts’ conclusions on cyber espionage’s lawfulness).\n259.

See Perlroth &amp; Shane, supra note 240 (explaining the proliferation of the United States’ leaked hacking tools, which North Korea and Russia weaponized).\n264. See David E. Sanger &amp; Nicole Perlroth, FireEye, a Top Cybersecurity Firm, Says it was Hacked by a Nation-State, N.Y. Times (Feb. 6, 2021), https://nyti.ms/3s42ejg (noting that an attacker’s use of leaked or stolen hacking tools reduces that attacker’s identifying footprint).\n265. See id. (suggesting that attackers will weaponize others’ leaked tools to protect their own tools from being burned).\n266. The CECT, like the Q-Model, recognizes that cyber attribution is not perfect and is “what States make of it.” Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4. Further, drawing a firm line for enablement would only create a State responsibility lighthouse for bad-faith actors to steer clear from. A “but for” standard could incentivize States to leak the tools prior to the attack and subsequently claim that the non-State actors obtained the tools from a public source. See Schneier, supra note 252.\n267. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 16–17 (noting an operation’s target can shed light on the attacker’s identity).\n268. For instance, a damage-enabling exploit could grant the attacker control over a system that, if manipulated in a certain manner, could cause physical damage or harm to objects or persons.\n269. See Wallace et al., supra note 249, at 221–24 (explaining that espionage does not violate international law). Physical destruction of a power grid, however, violates the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force. U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n270. An analysis’ inclusion of exploits that proximately enable damage would create nexus issues that may overly broaden State responsibility. See Bosnia Genocide, Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, ¶¶ 404–06 (Feb. 26) (rejecting the overall control test for unnecessarily broadening State responsibility).\n271. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17 (explaining the importance of analyzing the attacker’s target once inside the targeted system).\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n839\nthe protective relays.²⁷² Essentially, tactical and technical enablement focus on the “how” and “what” of the operation, and the subsequent part of the CECT, overall control, focuses on the operational and strategical support provide by the State.²⁷³\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n272. See The Epic Turla Operation, SECURELIST (Aug. 7, 2014), https://bit.ly/3sep73t (analyzing operation “Epic Turla,” where hackers compromised various government and military computer systems; once inside those systems, the attackers searched them for documents related to “NATO” and “[EU] energy dialogue,” suggesting the attackers were not States privy to NATO or EU energy dialogue information).\n273. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4.\n274. This portion of the test draws from the overall control test, formulated by the ICTY in Tadic. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A, Appeal Judgment, ¶ 122 (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia July 15, 1999).\n275. See id. ¶ 131 (“[A] State wield[s] overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”).\n276. International law does not prohibit reconnaissance and preparation, which essentially amounts to espionage, but both should nevertheless be considered when evaluating the CECT’s overall control portion. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 53, at 170 (noting that cyber espionage by itself does not violate international law, unless the spying State’s espionage violates one of its international legal obligations to another State).\n277. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A ¶ 122.\n278. See Hathaway et al., supra note 153, at 543.\n279. See id.\n280. See Nicaragua, Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, ¶ 115 (June 27).\n281. See id. (emphasizing that to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise overall control in the course of which the alleged violations took place).\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 126:3]\nUnder the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³\nIn sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶\n## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical\nFirst, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n282. See id.\n283. See id.\n284. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 7 (noting that cyber attribution revolves around minimizing uncertainty about the attackers identity).\n285. Bosnia Genocide, Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, ¶¶ 404–06 (Feb. 26) (rejecting the overall control test for unnecessarily broadening State responsibility).\n286. See id.\n287. See supra Section III.B.1.\n288. See Wallace et al., supra note 249, at 221–24.\n289. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 53, at 415.\n290. See supra Section III.B.1.\n291. For tactical enablement purposes, State B providing the hardware and network access to HG to carry out the attack factors into the control analysis rather than enablement. See Hathaway et al., supra note 153, at 577–78 (voicing concern about control standards that result in a State’s reluctance to aide groups out of concern for being liable for the group’s later ultra vires acts).\n292. The CECT does not require both tactical and technical enablement, but in this case, both were likely satisfied.\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n841\nNext, the CECT requires an evaluation of overall control.²⁹³ State B financed, recruited, and equipped the members of HG. From there, State B issued conditional instructions to HG, telling them to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened the national interests or reputation of State B. Notably, State B did not instruct HG to use Tartarus against State A’s power grid.²⁹⁴ Overall control does not demand such specific instructions;²⁹⁵ instead, the instructions and coordination can be general in nature.²⁹⁶ State B issued implicit targeting instructions to HG when State B gifted HG a custom malware capable of melting State A’s power grid.²⁹⁷\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWith powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰²\nWhile victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴\n293.

Westphal* ## ABSTRACT Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective * J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022. I would like to thank my wife and family for their endless support and the Penn State Law Review editing team for their feedback.\n\n[Vol. 126:3] control test and rejected easier-to-satisfy tests. To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents I.

CONCLUSION...841 2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL On August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Numerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹² Notably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nConsequently, cyber-deficient States turn to the international community for attribution assistance.¹⁸ Currently, an international cyber attribution mechanism does not exist, resulting in cyber-deficient states turning to existing international bodies, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁹ for attribution assistance.²⁰ The International Court of Justice serves as the United Nations’ “principal judicial organ.”²¹ In prior proxy cases, the ICJ applied the effective control test.²² Under the effective control test, to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise effective control over the non-State actor for the specific operation(s) subject to litigation.²³ The ICJ rejected a less demanding standard, the overall control test,²⁴ and reaffirmed the effective control test as its standard for proxy attribution.²⁵ Unfortunately, the effective control test lacks efficacy in the cyber domain; multiple scholars criticize the effective control test as being impractical for cyber operations.²⁶ Some scholars, such as Yuval Shany and Michael N. Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] until international political willpower elevates their idea to acceptance and implementation.²⁸ In recognition of the cyber domain’s seemingly never-ending regulatory purgatory,²⁹ this Comment accepts existing international organizations but advocates for the effective control test’s replacement.³⁰ This Comment presents a cyber-focused test that fills the gaps left by the effective control test’s application to a proxy-executed cyber operation.³¹ This Comment suggests a new two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”).³² The CECT’s first part analyzes the technical and tactical enablement of the operation—an analysis that the effective control test omits.³³ The second part mimics the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia’s (ICTY) overall control test.³⁴ In Part II, this Comment introduces the intricacies of the cyber domain, current cyber attribution practices, and international attribution standards.³⁵ Next, this Comment highlights the problems of the current international cyber regulatory dynamic for proxy-executed cyber operations and includes previously presented solutions to address these issues.³⁶ In Part III, this Comment presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the current standards and previously suggested solutions fail.³⁷ This Comment then recommends a new standard, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), to rectify current failures.³⁸\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## II. BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## B. Cyber Attribution Methods\nCyber attribution models are meant to determine factual attribution77 for a cyber operation.78 Cybersecurity experts do not profess an industry standard for factual attribution.79\nThis Comment focuses on the Q Model,80 one of the few publicly available and academically articulated cyber attribution models.81 The Q Model attempts to improve the cyber attribution process by “minimi[z]ing uncertainty” through three levels of analysis: (1) technical;82 (2)\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] operational;83 and (3) strategic.84 The technical level pursues the “how”; the operational level determines the “what,” and the strategic goal asks “who” and “why.”85 A Q Model analysis begins at the technical level, the foundation for the attribution process.86 The technical level considers how the attackers entered the system;87 what they looked for upon entrance;88 if their patterns-of-life indicate geographical regions;89 if there are any indicators of compromise present;90 the language used in the code comments; and if applicable, mistakes.91 Some technical aspects of an attack indicate State involvement.92 For example, a cyber-attack’s attempt to be stealthy can reveal its desire to remain undetected, its concern for having the attack attributed to its conductor, and to a certain extent, the operation’s overall sophistication.93 Furthermore, States with agencies or military departments with sophisticated cyber capabilities often employ legal oversight.94 Essentially, the cyber-attack’s targeting behavior, or what it chooses not to attack, can indicate the involvement of lawyers in the operation’s development.95 The technical level feeds clues to the operational level by beginning to paint a picture of the attacker’s identity.96 The operational level uses the technical level’s findings to explain non-technical and geopolitical aspects of the attack.97 For example, the\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nOn the strategic level, findings from the technical and operational levels are aggregated to draw conclusions.104 One of the more pressing strategic aspects revolves around damage, which is separated into four categories, two of which this Comment focuses on105: (1) direct and immediate106 and (2) direct and delayed.107 Moreover, damage can be “intended but not realized” or, the opposite, “realized but not intended.”108 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Beyond damage, an inquiry into the strategic level will ask “who benefited the most” and “who was damaged most[.]”¹⁰⁹ After a Q-Model investigation, uncertainty will be minimized to a degree,¹¹⁰ and factual attribution will likely be achieved. However, whether the cyber-attack can be legally attributed remains unanswered.¹¹¹ ## C. Legal Attribution for State Responsibility The cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶ “Legal attribution... deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State... to the [victim] State...; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³ The ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷ Furthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must... be shown that this ‘effective control’ was PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups... having committed the violations.”¹²⁹ Despite this elaboration, scholars criticize the effective control test as being too high of a bar, which leaves victim States reluctant to reach for it.¹³⁰ The ICTY, in Prosecutor v. Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴ Because the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶ In 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷... agreed in a consensus report... that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] of that operation.”¹⁴⁸ While the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides insights into how the effective control test could play out in cyberspace, States are not legally bound by the Tallinn Manual 2.0.¹⁴⁹ Consequently, the effective control test remains the ICJ standard for State responsibility, even in cyberspace, where States and non-State actors enjoy an added layer of obscurity and therefore, plausible deniability.¹⁵⁰ ## 3. Proposed Solutions to Rectify the Shortcomings of the Effective Control Test Scholars question the effective control test’s viability in cyberspace and take different approaches in rectifying its perceived shortcomings.¹⁵¹ Prominent scholars, including Oona A. Hathaway, the Director of the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum and Center of Global Legal Challenges,¹⁵² and her colleagues critique the effective control test generally and suggest broadening State responsibility by imposing liability on States that fail to ensure that the non-State actors that they support ensure respect for international law.¹⁵³ Peter Margulies,¹⁵⁴ professor of law at Roger Williams and another expert in security law, suggests a new standard altogether,¹⁵⁵ which Delbert Tran builds on and provides procedural suggestions for.¹⁵⁶ **Ensure respect principle.** In the article, *Ensuring Responsibility: Common Article 1 and State Responsibility For Non-State Actors*, authors Oona Hathaway et al., suggest that States, through Common\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n**Virtual control test.** In the article, *Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility*, author Peter Margulies presents a novel construction, the virtual control test (VCT).¹⁶² “Under the virtual control test, a victim State that has demonstrated that another nation funded or equipped a non-State actor can hold the second State responsible for the non-State actor’s cyber-attacks, unless the second State rebuts the presumption of responsibility.”¹⁶³ A State accused of exercising virtual control over a group “may rebut that presumption through cooperation in the victim State’s attribution efforts.”¹⁶⁴ **In camera and ex parte hearings.** In a student-written note, Delbert Tran presents a procedural framework for applying the VCT.¹⁶⁵ Tran, who viewed the technical attribution of a cyber-attack as a red herring,¹⁶⁶ attempts to provide procedural rules that would safeguard States’ covertly gathered intelligence.¹⁶⁷ To achieve this end, Tran suggests that the factfinder should employ *in camera*¹⁶⁸ and *ex parte* hearings.¹⁶⁹ Under this system, a State that wishes to keep its intelligence information and capabilities a secret would present the evidence to the factfinder and the accused State would presumably never see the evidence nor have the opportunity to refute it.¹⁷⁰ --- ¹⁵⁸.

ANALYSIS The existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸ The hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A. Hypothetical Cyber-Attack Scenario State A suffered a cyber-attack that rises to the level of an armed attack under IHL.¹⁸¹ A cyber-weapon, in the form of malware, attacked\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUsing the Q Model,¹⁸³ State A discovered the following to be true. Beginning with the technical level,¹⁸⁴ State A realizes that an employee accidentally downloaded remote access software¹⁸⁵ into the power grid’s system by downloading a spearphishing email’s malicious file.¹⁸⁶ Because State A’s power grid was neither encrypted¹⁸⁷ nor segmented,¹⁸⁸ the attackers obtained other employees’ log-in information, freely moved throughout the network, and undermined the integrity of grid’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition’s (SCADA)¹⁸⁹ security audit logging function.¹⁹⁰ To manipulate the logging function, the actors used a PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] zero-day exploit¹⁹¹ to insert a rootkit¹⁹² that would disguise a remote user as a non-remote user if an auditor reviewed the logs.¹⁹³ Three weeks later, HG, a hacking group located within State B and long rumored to be sponsored by State B, downloaded a custom malware,¹⁹⁴ Tartarus,¹⁹⁵ onto the power grid’s programmable logic controllers.¹⁹⁶ Tartarus’s code packaging times¹⁹⁷ conformed with State B’s six-day, eight-hour work schedule,¹⁹⁸ and the code itself contained slang commonly used in State B.¹⁹⁹ On the operational level,²⁰⁰ the overall attack occurred in three stages.²⁰¹ Phase one shut off the power, resulting in hospitals, home heating systems, and the like becoming ineffective.²⁰² Phase two created chaos by switching the power back on; because a portion of Tartarus’s payload neutralized the power grid’s protective relays,²⁰³ the power’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nIn phase three, the cyber-attackers triggered Tartarus’s wiper function, permanently deleting the computers’ data.²⁰⁶ At this point the attackers had ceased their operation but its effects continued. The lack of power caused traffic jams, further increasing emergency response times to put out the fires.\nOn the strategic level,²⁰⁷ the attackers must have tested the malware before unleashing it on State A.²⁰⁸ Moreover, State C, a former republic of State B, had experienced similar blackouts that it attributed to HG.²⁰⁹ At this point, State A factually attributed the cyber-attack to HG but doubted HG’s ability to conduct the operation without State support. State A suspected that State B, a regional rival of State A, conducted the operation through HG.\n## 2. The Relationship Between State B and HG State A, knowing that factual attribution achieves little in cyber proxy circumstances,²¹⁰ focuses on legally attributing HG’s operation to State B.²¹¹ Accordingly, State A conducts an investigation into State B and HG’s relationship.\n**State B transferred Tartarus to HG.** State B transferred the cyber weapon,²¹² Tartarus, to HG. State B designed Tartarus’s capability to (explaining that protective relays in electric utility operations deactivates a system when it “suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system”).\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems²¹³ used by State A’s energy industry.²¹⁴ Further, State B created the portion of Tartarus that undermined the power grid’s protective relays, causing unprotected power surges and fires.²¹⁵ State B supports HG. State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests. Days before the attack, an investigative reporting company, incorporated in Zero-Day Hacking Techniques, WIRED (Apr. 6, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://bit.ly/3k7Kgbr (providing a map of zero-day exploit usage among States, showing some States, which are known to be behind the international curve on developing cyber capabilities, using zero-day exploits; suggesting that these States bought the zero-days instead of developing or discovering them). The sale of zero-day exploits can be categorized as a form of espionage and therefore, does not play a major role in this Comment.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³ ## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test Assuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Tran²²⁹ pursue an antidote to this dilemma, but their solutions ultimately lack efficacy in cyberspace.\n## 4. Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions Although the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴ Notably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test This Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] that the enabling State exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.²⁴⁶ Thus, the two-part test imposes liability on a State for enabling a cyber operation and exercising overall control over the non-State actor conducting it.\n\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰ Technical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] the wild” shield²⁶³—that accused States hide behind.²⁶⁴ Essentially, requiring the victim State to prove both forms of enablement would make the CECT a non-starter if the tools used in the operation were previously known.²⁶⁵ Enablement of a cyber operation should be considered under a totality of the circumstances analysis.²⁶⁶ Two potential circumstances to consider are the nature of the exploit and its target.²⁶⁷ An exploit can be damage-enabling or non-damage-enabling.²⁶⁸ For example, a zero-day exploit that enables a spyware program to self-propagate differs from a zero-day exploit wielding malware program that compromises the integrity of a power grid’s protective relays.²⁶⁹ Accordingly, States that create and transfer damage-enabling exploits should be responsible for the damage caused by those exploits when their proxies use them against other States.²⁷⁰ In addition, a targeting analysis should focus on the exploits specific target, not necessarily the general network or system that the cyber operation targets.²⁷¹ Essentially, a zero-day exploit that seeks to gain access to a power grid’s network targets the power grid; in contrast, a zero-day exploit that corrupts that same power grid’s protective relays targets\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶ ## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical First, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION With powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰² While victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴ PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²",

Westphal* ## ABSTRACT Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective * J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022. I would like to thank my wife and family for their endless support and the Penn State Law Review editing team for their feedback.\n[Vol. 126:3] control test and rejected easier-to-satisfy tests. To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents I.

CONCLUSION...841 2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL On August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Numerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹² Notably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nConsequently, cyber-deficient States turn to the international community for attribution assistance.¹⁸ Currently, an international cyber attribution mechanism does not exist, resulting in cyber-deficient states turning to existing international bodies, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁹ for attribution assistance.²⁰ The International Court of Justice serves as the United Nations’ “principal judicial organ.”²¹ In prior proxy cases, the ICJ applied the effective control test.²² Under the effective control test, to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise effective control over the non-State actor for the specific operation(s) subject to litigation.²³ The ICJ rejected a less demanding standard, the overall control test,²⁴ and reaffirmed the effective control test as its standard for proxy attribution.²⁵ Unfortunately, the effective control test lacks efficacy in the cyber domain; multiple scholars criticize the effective control test as being impractical for cyber operations.²⁶ Some scholars, such as Yuval Shany and Michael N. Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] until international political willpower elevates their idea to acceptance and implementation.²⁸ In recognition of the cyber domain’s seemingly never-ending regulatory purgatory,²⁹ this Comment accepts existing international organizations but advocates for the effective control test’s replacement.³⁰ This Comment presents a cyber-focused test that fills the gaps left by the effective control test’s application to a proxy-executed cyber operation.³¹ This Comment suggests a new two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”).³² The CECT’s first part analyzes the technical and tactical enablement of the operation—an analysis that the effective control test omits.³³ The second part mimics the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia’s (ICTY) overall control test.³⁴ In Part II, this Comment introduces the intricacies of the cyber domain, current cyber attribution practices, and international attribution standards.³⁵ Next, this Comment highlights the problems of the current international cyber regulatory dynamic for proxy-executed cyber operations and includes previously presented solutions to address these issues.³⁶ In Part III, this Comment presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the current standards and previously suggested solutions fail.³⁷ This Comment then recommends a new standard, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), to rectify current failures.³⁸\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL",
    "## II. BACKGROUND": "Binding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL",
    "## B. Cyber Attribution Methods": "Cyber attribution models are meant to determine factual attribution77 for a cyber operation.78 Cybersecurity experts do not profess an industry standard for factual attribution.79\nThis Comment focuses on the Q Model,80 one of the few publicly available and academically articulated cyber attribution models.81 The Q Model attempts to improve the cyber attribution process by “minimi[z]ing uncertainty” through three levels of analysis: (1) technical;82 (2)\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] operational;83 and (3) strategic.84 The technical level pursues the “how”; the operational level determines the “what,” and the strategic goal asks “who” and “why.”85 A Q Model analysis begins at the technical level, the foundation for the attribution process.86 The technical level considers how the attackers entered the system;87 what they looked for upon entrance;88 if their patterns-of-life indicate geographical regions;89 if there are any indicators of compromise present;90 the language used in the code comments; and if applicable, mistakes.91 Some technical aspects of an attack indicate State involvement.92 For example, a cyber-attack’s attempt to be stealthy can reveal its desire to remain undetected, its concern for having the attack attributed to its conductor, and to a certain extent, the operation’s overall sophistication.93 Furthermore, States with agencies or military departments with sophisticated cyber capabilities often employ legal oversight.94 Essentially, the cyber-attack’s targeting behavior, or what it chooses not to attack, can indicate the involvement of lawyers in the operation’s development.95 The technical level feeds clues to the operational level by beginning to paint a picture of the attacker’s identity.96 The operational level uses the technical level’s findings to explain non-technical and geopolitical aspects of the attack.97 For example, the\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nOn the strategic level, findings from the technical and operational levels are aggregated to draw conclusions.104 One of the more pressing strategic aspects revolves around damage, which is separated into four categories, two of which this Comment focuses on105: (1) direct and immediate106 and (2) direct and delayed.107 Moreover, damage can be “intended but not realized” or, the opposite, “realized but not intended.”108 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Beyond damage, an inquiry into the strategic level will ask “who benefited the most” and “who was damaged most[.]”¹⁰⁹ After a Q-Model investigation, uncertainty will be minimized to a degree,¹¹⁰ and factual attribution will likely be achieved. However, whether the cyber-attack can be legally attributed remains unanswered.¹¹¹ ## C. Legal Attribution for State Responsibility The cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶ “Legal attribution... deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State... to the [victim] State...; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³ The ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷ Furthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must... be shown that this ‘effective control’ was PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups... having committed the violations.”¹²⁹ Despite this elaboration, scholars criticize the effective control test as being too high of a bar, which leaves victim States reluctant to reach for it.¹³⁰ The ICTY, in Prosecutor v. Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴ Because the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶ In 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷... agreed in a consensus report... that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL",
    "## 2. International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors": "The Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] of that operation.”¹⁴⁸ While the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides insights into how the effective control test could play out in cyberspace, States are not legally bound by the Tallinn Manual 2.0.¹⁴⁹ Consequently, the effective control test remains the ICJ standard for State responsibility, even in cyberspace, where States and non-State actors enjoy an added layer of obscurity and therefore, plausible deniability.¹⁵⁰ ## 3. Proposed Solutions to Rectify the Shortcomings of the Effective Control Test Scholars question the effective control test’s viability in cyberspace and take different approaches in rectifying its perceived shortcomings.¹⁵¹ Prominent scholars, including Oona A. Hathaway, the Director of the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum and Center of Global Legal Challenges,¹⁵² and her colleagues critique the effective control test generally and suggest broadening State responsibility by imposing liability on States that fail to ensure that the non-State actors that they support ensure respect for international law.¹⁵³ Peter Margulies,¹⁵⁴ professor of law at Roger Williams and another expert in security law, suggests a new standard altogether,¹⁵⁵ which Delbert Tran builds on and provides procedural suggestions for.¹⁵⁶ **Ensure respect principle.** In the article, *Ensuring Responsibility: Common Article 1 and State Responsibility For Non-State Actors*, authors Oona Hathaway et al., suggest that States, through Common\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n**Virtual control test.** In the article, *Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility*, author Peter Margulies presents a novel construction, the virtual control test (VCT).¹⁶² “Under the virtual control test, a victim State that has demonstrated that another nation funded or equipped a non-State actor can hold the second State responsible for the non-State actor’s cyber-attacks, unless the second State rebuts the presumption of responsibility.”¹⁶³ A State accused of exercising virtual control over a group “may rebut that presumption through cooperation in the victim State’s attribution efforts.”¹⁶⁴ **In camera and ex parte hearings.** In a student-written note, Delbert Tran presents a procedural framework for applying the VCT.¹⁶⁵ Tran, who viewed the technical attribution of a cyber-attack as a red herring,¹⁶⁶ attempts to provide procedural rules that would safeguard States’ covertly gathered intelligence.¹⁶⁷ To achieve this end, Tran suggests that the factfinder should employ *in camera*¹⁶⁸ and *ex parte* hearings.¹⁶⁹ Under this system, a State that wishes to keep its intelligence information and capabilities a secret would present the evidence to the factfinder and the accused State would presumably never see the evidence nor have the opportunity to refute it.¹⁷⁰ --- ¹⁵⁸.

See Tran, *supra* note 156, at 423.\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Overall, legal attribution in the cyber domain lacks evidentiary standards.¹⁷¹ As a consequence, existing standards, created for practically and functionally different warfighting domains, are applied to the cyber domain.¹⁷² In response, scholars and cybersecurity researchers scramble to fill the square holes—the cyber domain’s legal attribution problem—that are left unpatched by circular pegs—standards designed for kinetic conflicts.¹⁷³ ## III. ANALYSIS The existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸ The hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A. Hypothetical Cyber-Attack Scenario State A suffered a cyber-attack that rises to the level of an armed attack under IHL.¹⁸¹ A cyber-weapon, in the form of malware, attacked\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nUsing the Q Model,¹⁸³ State A discovered the following to be true. Beginning with the technical level,¹⁸⁴ State A realizes that an employee accidentally downloaded remote access software¹⁸⁵ into the power grid’s system by downloading a spearphishing email’s malicious file.¹⁸⁶ Because State A’s power grid was neither encrypted¹⁸⁷ nor segmented,¹⁸⁸ the attackers obtained other employees’ log-in information, freely moved throughout the network, and undermined the integrity of grid’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition’s (SCADA)¹⁸⁹ security audit logging function.¹⁹⁰ To manipulate the logging function, the actors used a PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] zero-day exploit¹⁹¹ to insert a rootkit¹⁹² that would disguise a remote user as a non-remote user if an auditor reviewed the logs.¹⁹³ Three weeks later, HG, a hacking group located within State B and long rumored to be sponsored by State B, downloaded a custom malware,¹⁹⁴ Tartarus,¹⁹⁵ onto the power grid’s programmable logic controllers.¹⁹⁶ Tartarus’s code packaging times¹⁹⁷ conformed with State B’s six-day, eight-hour work schedule,¹⁹⁸ and the code itself contained slang commonly used in State B.¹⁹⁹ On the operational level,²⁰⁰ the overall attack occurred in three stages.²⁰¹ Phase one shut off the power, resulting in hospitals, home heating systems, and the like becoming ineffective.²⁰² Phase two created chaos by switching the power back on; because a portion of Tartarus’s payload neutralized the power grid’s protective relays,²⁰³ the power’s\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nIn phase three, the cyber-attackers triggered Tartarus’s wiper function, permanently deleting the computers’ data.²⁰⁶ At this point the attackers had ceased their operation but its effects continued. The lack of power caused traffic jams, further increasing emergency response times to put out the fires.\nOn the strategic level,²⁰⁷ the attackers must have tested the malware before unleashing it on State A.²⁰⁸ Moreover, State C, a former republic of State B, had experienced similar blackouts that it attributed to HG.²⁰⁹ At this point, State A factually attributed the cyber-attack to HG but doubted HG’s ability to conduct the operation without State support. State A suspected that State B, a regional rival of State A, conducted the operation through HG.",
    "## 2. The Relationship Between State B and HG State A, knowing that factual attribution achieves little in cyber proxy circumstances,²¹⁰ focuses on legally attributing HG’s operation to State B.²¹¹ Accordingly, State A conducts an investigation into State B and HG’s relationship.": "**State B transferred Tartarus to HG.** State B transferred the cyber weapon,²¹² Tartarus, to HG. State B designed Tartarus’s capability to (explaining that protective relays in electric utility operations deactivates a system when it “suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system”).\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems²¹³ used by State A’s energy industry.²¹⁴ Further, State B created the portion of Tartarus that undermined the power grid’s protective relays, causing unprotected power surges and fires.²¹⁵ State B supports HG. State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests. Days before the attack, an investigative reporting company, incorporated in Zero-Day Hacking Techniques, WIRED (Apr. 6, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://bit.ly/3k7Kgbr (providing a map of zero-day exploit usage among States, showing some States, which are known to be behind the international curve on developing cyber capabilities, using zero-day exploits; suggesting that these States bought the zero-days instead of developing or discovering them). The sale of zero-day exploits can be categorized as a form of espionage and therefore, does not play a major role in this Comment.\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³ ## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test Assuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Tran²²⁹ pursue an antidote to this dilemma, but their solutions ultimately lack efficacy in cyberspace.",
    "## 4. Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions Although the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴ Notably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.": "Margulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.",
    "## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test This Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] that the enabling State exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.²⁴⁶ Thus, the two-part test imposes liability on a State for enabling a cyber operation and exercising overall control over the non-State actor conducting it.": "First, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰ Technical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] the wild” shield²⁶³—that accused States hide behind.²⁶⁴ Essentially, requiring the victim State to prove both forms of enablement would make the CECT a non-starter if the tools used in the operation were previously known.²⁶⁵ Enablement of a cyber operation should be considered under a totality of the circumstances analysis.²⁶⁶ Two potential circumstances to consider are the nature of the exploit and its target.²⁶⁷ An exploit can be damage-enabling or non-damage-enabling.²⁶⁸ For example, a zero-day exploit that enables a spyware program to self-propagate differs from a zero-day exploit wielding malware program that compromises the integrity of a power grid’s protective relays.²⁶⁹ Accordingly, States that create and transfer damage-enabling exploits should be responsible for the damage caused by those exploits when their proxies use them against other States.²⁷⁰ In addition, a targeting analysis should focus on the exploits specific target, not necessarily the general network or system that the cyber operation targets.²⁷¹ Essentially, a zero-day exploit that seeks to gain access to a power grid’s network targets the power grid; in contrast, a zero-day exploit that corrupts that same power grid’s protective relays targets\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL",
    "## 2. Overall Control During the Operation": "Second, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶ ## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical First, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.",
    "## IV. CONCLUSION With powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰² While victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴ PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²": ""

Westphal* ## ABSTRACT Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective * J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents I.

CONCLUSION...841 2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL On August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Numerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹² Notably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nConsequently, cyber-deficient States turn to the international community for attribution assistance.¹⁸ Currently, an international cyber attribution mechanism does not exist, resulting in cyber-deficient states turning to existing international bodies, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁹ for attribution assistance.²⁰ The International Court of Justice serves as the United Nations’ “principal judicial organ.”²¹ In prior proxy cases, the ICJ applied the effective control test.²² Under the effective control test, to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise effective control over the non-State actor for the specific operation(s) subject to litigation.²³ The ICJ rejected a less demanding standard, the overall control test,²⁴ and reaffirmed the effective control test as its standard for proxy attribution.²⁵ Unfortunately, the effective control test lacks efficacy in the cyber domain; multiple scholars criticize the effective control test as being impractical for cyber operations.²⁶ Some scholars, such as Yuval Shany and Michael N. Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] until international political willpower elevates their idea to acceptance and implementation.²⁸ In recognition of the cyber domain’s seemingly never-ending regulatory purgatory,²⁹ this Comment accepts existing international organizations but advocates for the effective control test’s replacement.³⁰ This Comment presents a cyber-focused test that fills the gaps left by the effective control test’s application to a proxy-executed cyber operation.³¹ This Comment suggests a new two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”).³² The CECT’s first part analyzes the technical and tactical enablement of the operation—an analysis that the effective control test omits.³³ The second part mimics the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia’s (ICTY) overall control test.³⁴ In Part II, this Comment introduces the intricacies of the cyber domain, current cyber attribution practices, and international attribution standards.³⁵ Next, this Comment highlights the problems of the current international cyber regulatory dynamic for proxy-executed cyber operations and includes previously presented solutions to address these issues.³⁶ In Part III, this Comment presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the current standards and previously suggested solutions fail.³⁷ This Comment then recommends a new standard, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), to rectify current failures.³⁸\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## II. BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## B. Cyber Attribution Methods\nCyber attribution models are meant to determine factual attribution77 for a cyber operation.78 Cybersecurity experts do not profess an industry standard for factual attribution.79\nThis Comment focuses on the Q Model,80 one of the few publicly available and academically articulated cyber attribution models.81 The Q Model attempts to improve the cyber attribution process by “minimi[z]ing uncertainty” through three levels of analysis: (1) technical;82 (2)\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] operational;83 and (3) strategic.84 The technical level pursues the “how”; the operational level determines the “what,” and the strategic goal asks “who” and “why.”85 A Q Model analysis begins at the technical level, the foundation for the attribution process.86 The technical level considers how the attackers entered the system;87 what they looked for upon entrance;88 if their patterns-of-life indicate geographical regions;89 if there are any indicators of compromise present;90 the language used in the code comments; and if applicable, mistakes.91 Some technical aspects of an attack indicate State involvement.92 For example, a cyber-attack’s attempt to be stealthy can reveal its desire to remain undetected, its concern for having the attack attributed to its conductor, and to a certain extent, the operation’s overall sophistication.93 Furthermore, States with agencies or military departments with sophisticated cyber capabilities often employ legal oversight.94 Essentially, the cyber-attack’s targeting behavior, or what it chooses not to attack, can indicate the involvement of lawyers in the operation’s development.95 The technical level feeds clues to the operational level by beginning to paint a picture of the attacker’s identity.96 The operational level uses the technical level’s findings to explain non-technical and geopolitical aspects of the attack.97 For example, the\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nOn the strategic level, findings from the technical and operational levels are aggregated to draw conclusions.104 One of the more pressing strategic aspects revolves around damage, which is separated into four categories, two of which this Comment focuses on105: (1) direct and immediate106 and (2) direct and delayed.107 Moreover, damage can be “intended but not realized” or, the opposite, “realized but not intended.”108 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Beyond damage, an inquiry into the strategic level will ask “who benefited the most” and “who was damaged most[.]”¹⁰⁹ After a Q-Model investigation, uncertainty will be minimized to a degree,¹¹⁰ and factual attribution will likely be achieved. However, whether the cyber-attack can be legally attributed remains unanswered.¹¹¹ ## C. Legal Attribution for State Responsibility The cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶ “Legal attribution... deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State... to the [victim] State...; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³ The ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷ Furthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must... be shown that this ‘effective control’ was PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups... having committed the violations.”¹²⁹ Despite this elaboration, scholars criticize the effective control test as being too high of a bar, which leaves victim States reluctant to reach for it.¹³⁰ The ICTY, in Prosecutor v. Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴ Because the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶ In 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷... agreed in a consensus report... that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] of that operation.”¹⁴⁸ While the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides insights into how the effective control test could play out in cyberspace, States are not legally bound by the Tallinn Manual 2.0.¹⁴⁹ Consequently, the effective control test remains the ICJ standard for State responsibility, even in cyberspace, where States and non-State actors enjoy an added layer of obscurity and therefore, plausible deniability.¹⁵⁰ ## 3. Proposed Solutions to Rectify the Shortcomings of the Effective Control Test Scholars question the effective control test’s viability in cyberspace and take different approaches in rectifying its perceived shortcomings.¹⁵¹ Prominent scholars, including Oona A. Hathaway, the Director of the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum and Center of Global Legal Challenges,¹⁵² and her colleagues critique the effective control test generally and suggest broadening State responsibility by imposing liability on States that fail to ensure that the non-State actors that they support ensure respect for international law.¹⁵³ Peter Margulies,¹⁵⁴ professor of law at Roger Williams and another expert in security law, suggests a new standard altogether,¹⁵⁵ which Delbert Tran builds on and provides procedural suggestions for.¹⁵⁶ **Ensure respect principle.** In the article, *Ensuring Responsibility: Common Article 1 and State Responsibility For Non-State Actors*, authors Oona Hathaway et al., suggest that States, through Common\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n**Virtual control test.** In the article, *Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility*, author Peter Margulies presents a novel construction, the virtual control test (VCT).¹⁶² “Under the virtual control test, a victim State that has demonstrated that another nation funded or equipped a non-State actor can hold the second State responsible for the non-State actor’s cyber-attacks, unless the second State rebuts the presumption of responsibility.”¹⁶³ A State accused of exercising virtual control over a group “may rebut that presumption through cooperation in the victim State’s attribution efforts.”¹⁶⁴ **In camera and ex parte hearings.** In a student-written note, Delbert Tran presents a procedural framework for applying the VCT.¹⁶⁵ Tran, who viewed the technical attribution of a cyber-attack as a red herring,¹⁶⁶ attempts to provide procedural rules that would safeguard States’ covertly gathered intelligence.¹⁶⁷ To achieve this end, Tran suggests that the factfinder should employ *in camera*¹⁶⁸ and *ex parte* hearings.¹⁶⁹ Under this system, a State that wishes to keep its intelligence information and capabilities a secret would present the evidence to the factfinder and the accused State would presumably never see the evidence nor have the opportunity to refute it.¹⁷⁰ --- ¹⁵⁸.

ANALYSIS The existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸ The hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A. Hypothetical Cyber-Attack Scenario State A suffered a cyber-attack that rises to the level of an armed attack under IHL.¹⁸¹ A cyber-weapon, in the form of malware, attacked\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUsing the Q Model,¹⁸³ State A discovered the following to be true. Beginning with the technical level,¹⁸⁴ State A realizes that an employee accidentally downloaded remote access software¹⁸⁵ into the power grid’s system by downloading a spearphishing email’s malicious file.¹⁸⁶ Because State A’s power grid was neither encrypted¹⁸⁷ nor segmented,¹⁸⁸ the attackers obtained other employees’ log-in information, freely moved throughout the network, and undermined the integrity of grid’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition’s (SCADA)¹⁸⁹ security audit logging function.¹⁹⁰ To manipulate the logging function, the actors used a PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] zero-day exploit¹⁹¹ to insert a rootkit¹⁹² that would disguise a remote user as a non-remote user if an auditor reviewed the logs.¹⁹³ Three weeks later, HG, a hacking group located within State B and long rumored to be sponsored by State B, downloaded a custom malware,¹⁹⁴ Tartarus,¹⁹⁵ onto the power grid’s programmable logic controllers.¹⁹⁶ Tartarus’s code packaging times¹⁹⁷ conformed with State B’s six-day, eight-hour work schedule,¹⁹⁸ and the code itself contained slang commonly used in State B.¹⁹⁹ On the operational level,²⁰⁰ the overall attack occurred in three stages.²⁰¹ Phase one shut off the power, resulting in hospitals, home heating systems, and the like becoming ineffective.²⁰² Phase two created chaos by switching the power back on; because a portion of Tartarus’s payload neutralized the power grid’s protective relays,²⁰³ the power’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nIn phase three, the cyber-attackers triggered Tartarus’s wiper function, permanently deleting the computers’ data.²⁰⁶ At this point the attackers had ceased their operation but its effects continued. The lack of power caused traffic jams, further increasing emergency response times to put out the fires.\nOn the strategic level,²⁰⁷ the attackers must have tested the malware before unleashing it on State A.²⁰⁸ Moreover, State C, a former republic of State B, had experienced similar blackouts that it attributed to HG.²⁰⁹ At this point, State A factually attributed the cyber-attack to HG but doubted HG’s ability to conduct the operation without State support. State A suspected that State B, a regional rival of State A, conducted the operation through HG.\n## 2. The Relationship Between State B and HG State A, knowing that factual attribution achieves little in cyber proxy circumstances,²¹⁰ focuses on legally attributing HG’s operation to State B.²¹¹ Accordingly, State A conducts an investigation into State B and HG’s relationship.\n**State B transferred Tartarus to HG.** State B transferred the cyber weapon,²¹² Tartarus, to HG. State B designed Tartarus’s capability to (explaining that protective relays in electric utility operations deactivates a system when it “suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system”).\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems²¹³ used by State A’s energy industry.²¹⁴ Further, State B created the portion of Tartarus that undermined the power grid’s protective relays, causing unprotected power surges and fires.²¹⁵ State B supports HG. State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests. Days before the attack, an investigative reporting company, incorporated in Zero-Day Hacking Techniques, WIRED (Apr. 6, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://bit.ly/3k7Kgbr (providing a map of zero-day exploit usage among States, showing some States, which are known to be behind the international curve on developing cyber capabilities, using zero-day exploits; suggesting that these States bought the zero-days instead of developing or discovering them). The sale of zero-day exploits can be categorized as a form of espionage and therefore, does not play a major role in this Comment.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³ ## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test Assuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Tran²²⁹ pursue an antidote to this dilemma, but their solutions ultimately lack efficacy in cyberspace.\n## 4. Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions Although the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴ Notably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test This Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] that the enabling State exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.²⁴⁶ Thus, the two-part test imposes liability on a State for enabling a cyber operation and exercising overall control over the non-State actor conducting it.\n\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰ Technical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] the wild” shield²⁶³—that accused States hide behind.²⁶⁴ Essentially, requiring the victim State to prove both forms of enablement would make the CECT a non-starter if the tools used in the operation were previously known.²⁶⁵ Enablement of a cyber operation should be considered under a totality of the circumstances analysis.²⁶⁶ Two potential circumstances to consider are the nature of the exploit and its target.²⁶⁷ An exploit can be damage-enabling or non-damage-enabling.²⁶⁸ For example, a zero-day exploit that enables a spyware program to self-propagate differs from a zero-day exploit wielding malware program that compromises the integrity of a power grid’s protective relays.²⁶⁹ Accordingly, States that create and transfer damage-enabling exploits should be responsible for the damage caused by those exploits when their proxies use them against other States.²⁷⁰ In addition, a targeting analysis should focus on the exploits specific target, not necessarily the general network or system that the cyber operation targets.²⁷¹ Essentially, a zero-day exploit that seeks to gain access to a power grid’s network targets the power grid; in contrast, a zero-day exploit that corrupts that same power grid’s protective relays targets\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶ ## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical First, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION With powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰² While victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴ PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²",

In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A.

Notably, State B did not instruct HG to use Tartarus against State A’s power grid.²⁹⁴ Overall control does not demand such specific instructions;²⁹⁵ instead, the instructions and coordination can be general in nature.²⁹⁶ State B issued implicit targeting instructions to HG when State B gifted HG a custom malware capable of melting State A’s power grid.²⁹⁷ Under the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG.

PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²",

Westphal* ## ABSTRACT Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective * J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents I.

CONCLUSION...841 2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL On August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Numerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹² Notably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nConsequently, cyber-deficient States turn to the international community for attribution assistance.¹⁸ Currently, an international cyber attribution mechanism does not exist, resulting in cyber-deficient states turning to existing international bodies, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁹ for attribution assistance.²⁰ The International Court of Justice serves as the United Nations’ “principal judicial organ.”²¹ In prior proxy cases, the ICJ applied the effective control test.²² Under the effective control test, to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise effective control over the non-State actor for the specific operation(s) subject to litigation.²³ The ICJ rejected a less demanding standard, the overall control test,²⁴ and reaffirmed the effective control test as its standard for proxy attribution.²⁵ Unfortunately, the effective control test lacks efficacy in the cyber domain; multiple scholars criticize the effective control test as being impractical for cyber operations.²⁶ Some scholars, such as Yuval Shany and Michael N. Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] until international political willpower elevates their idea to acceptance and implementation.²⁸ In recognition of the cyber domain’s seemingly never-ending regulatory purgatory,²⁹ this Comment accepts existing international organizations but advocates for the effective control test’s replacement.³⁰ This Comment presents a cyber-focused test that fills the gaps left by the effective control test’s application to a proxy-executed cyber operation.³¹ This Comment suggests a new two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”).³² The CECT’s first part analyzes the technical and tactical enablement of the operation—an analysis that the effective control test omits.³³ The second part mimics the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia’s (ICTY) overall control test.³⁴ In Part II, this Comment introduces the intricacies of the cyber domain, current cyber attribution practices, and international attribution standards.³⁵ Next, this Comment highlights the problems of the current international cyber regulatory dynamic for proxy-executed cyber operations and includes previously presented solutions to address these issues.³⁶ In Part III, this Comment presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the current standards and previously suggested solutions fail.³⁷ This Comment then recommends a new standard, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), to rectify current failures.³⁸\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## II. BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## B. Cyber Attribution Methods\nCyber attribution models are meant to determine factual attribution77 for a cyber operation.78 Cybersecurity experts do not profess an industry standard for factual attribution.79\nThis Comment focuses on the Q Model,80 one of the few publicly available and academically articulated cyber attribution models.81 The Q Model attempts to improve the cyber attribution process by “minimi[z]ing uncertainty” through three levels of analysis: (1) technical;82 (2)\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] operational;83 and (3) strategic.84 The technical level pursues the “how”; the operational level determines the “what,” and the strategic goal asks “who” and “why.”85 A Q Model analysis begins at the technical level, the foundation for the attribution process.86 The technical level considers how the attackers entered the system;87 what they looked for upon entrance;88 if their patterns-of-life indicate geographical regions;89 if there are any indicators of compromise present;90 the language used in the code comments; and if applicable, mistakes.91 Some technical aspects of an attack indicate State involvement.92 For example, a cyber-attack’s attempt to be stealthy can reveal its desire to remain undetected, its concern for having the attack attributed to its conductor, and to a certain extent, the operation’s overall sophistication.93 Furthermore, States with agencies or military departments with sophisticated cyber capabilities often employ legal oversight.94 Essentially, the cyber-attack’s targeting behavior, or what it chooses not to attack, can indicate the involvement of lawyers in the operation’s development.95 The technical level feeds clues to the operational level by beginning to paint a picture of the attacker’s identity.96 The operational level uses the technical level’s findings to explain non-technical and geopolitical aspects of the attack.97 For example, the\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nOn the strategic level, findings from the technical and operational levels are aggregated to draw conclusions.104 One of the more pressing strategic aspects revolves around damage, which is separated into four categories, two of which this Comment focuses on105: (1) direct and immediate106 and (2) direct and delayed.107 Moreover, damage can be “intended but not realized” or, the opposite, “realized but not intended.”108 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Beyond damage, an inquiry into the strategic level will ask “who benefited the most” and “who was damaged most[.]”¹⁰⁹ After a Q-Model investigation, uncertainty will be minimized to a degree,¹¹⁰ and factual attribution will likely be achieved. However, whether the cyber-attack can be legally attributed remains unanswered.¹¹¹ ## C. Legal Attribution for State Responsibility The cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶ “Legal attribution... deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State... to the [victim] State...; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³ The ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷ Furthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must... be shown that this ‘effective control’ was PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups... having committed the violations.”¹²⁹ Despite this elaboration, scholars criticize the effective control test as being too high of a bar, which leaves victim States reluctant to reach for it.¹³⁰ The ICTY, in Prosecutor v. Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴ Because the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶ In 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷... agreed in a consensus report... that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] of that operation.”¹⁴⁸ While the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides insights into how the effective control test could play out in cyberspace, States are not legally bound by the Tallinn Manual 2.0.¹⁴⁹ Consequently, the effective control test remains the ICJ standard for State responsibility, even in cyberspace, where States and non-State actors enjoy an added layer of obscurity and therefore, plausible deniability.¹⁵⁰ ## 3. Proposed Solutions to Rectify the Shortcomings of the Effective Control Test Scholars question the effective control test’s viability in cyberspace and take different approaches in rectifying its perceived shortcomings.¹⁵¹ Prominent scholars, including Oona A. Hathaway, the Director of the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum and Center of Global Legal Challenges,¹⁵² and her colleagues critique the effective control test generally and suggest broadening State responsibility by imposing liability on States that fail to ensure that the non-State actors that they support ensure respect for international law.¹⁵³ Peter Margulies,¹⁵⁴ professor of law at Roger Williams and another expert in security law, suggests a new standard altogether,¹⁵⁵ which Delbert Tran builds on and provides procedural suggestions for.¹⁵⁶ **Ensure respect principle.** In the article, *Ensuring Responsibility: Common Article 1 and State Responsibility For Non-State Actors*, authors Oona Hathaway et al., suggest that States, through Common\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n**Virtual control test.** In the article, *Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility*, author Peter Margulies presents a novel construction, the virtual control test (VCT).¹⁶² “Under the virtual control test, a victim State that has demonstrated that another nation funded or equipped a non-State actor can hold the second State responsible for the non-State actor’s cyber-attacks, unless the second State rebuts the presumption of responsibility.”¹⁶³ A State accused of exercising virtual control over a group “may rebut that presumption through cooperation in the victim State’s attribution efforts.”¹⁶⁴ **In camera and ex parte hearings.** In a student-written note, Delbert Tran presents a procedural framework for applying the VCT.¹⁶⁵ Tran, who viewed the technical attribution of a cyber-attack as a red herring,¹⁶⁶ attempts to provide procedural rules that would safeguard States’ covertly gathered intelligence.¹⁶⁷ To achieve this end, Tran suggests that the factfinder should employ *in camera*¹⁶⁸ and *ex parte* hearings.¹⁶⁹ Under this system, a State that wishes to keep its intelligence information and capabilities a secret would present the evidence to the factfinder and the accused State would presumably never see the evidence nor have the opportunity to refute it.¹⁷⁰ --- ¹⁵⁸.

ANALYSIS The existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸ The hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A. Hypothetical Cyber-Attack Scenario State A suffered a cyber-attack that rises to the level of an armed attack under IHL.¹⁸¹ A cyber-weapon, in the form of malware, attacked\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUsing the Q Model,¹⁸³ State A discovered the following to be true. Beginning with the technical level,¹⁸⁴ State A realizes that an employee accidentally downloaded remote access software¹⁸⁵ into the power grid’s system by downloading a spearphishing email’s malicious file.¹⁸⁶ Because State A’s power grid was neither encrypted¹⁸⁷ nor segmented,¹⁸⁸ the attackers obtained other employees’ log-in information, freely moved throughout the network, and undermined the integrity of grid’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition’s (SCADA)¹⁸⁹ security audit logging function.¹⁹⁰ To manipulate the logging function, the actors used a PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] zero-day exploit¹⁹¹ to insert a rootkit¹⁹² that would disguise a remote user as a non-remote user if an auditor reviewed the logs.¹⁹³ Three weeks later, HG, a hacking group located within State B and long rumored to be sponsored by State B, downloaded a custom malware,¹⁹⁴ Tartarus,¹⁹⁵ onto the power grid’s programmable logic controllers.¹⁹⁶ Tartarus’s code packaging times¹⁹⁷ conformed with State B’s six-day, eight-hour work schedule,¹⁹⁸ and the code itself contained slang commonly used in State B.¹⁹⁹ On the operational level,²⁰⁰ the overall attack occurred in three stages.²⁰¹ Phase one shut off the power, resulting in hospitals, home heating systems, and the like becoming ineffective.²⁰² Phase two created chaos by switching the power back on; because a portion of Tartarus’s payload neutralized the power grid’s protective relays,²⁰³ the power’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nIn phase three, the cyber-attackers triggered Tartarus’s wiper function, permanently deleting the computers’ data.²⁰⁶ At this point the attackers had ceased their operation but its effects continued. The lack of power caused traffic jams, further increasing emergency response times to put out the fires.\nOn the strategic level,²⁰⁷ the attackers must have tested the malware before unleashing it on State A.²⁰⁸ Moreover, State C, a former republic of State B, had experienced similar blackouts that it attributed to HG.²⁰⁹ At this point, State A factually attributed the cyber-attack to HG but doubted HG’s ability to conduct the operation without State support. State A suspected that State B, a regional rival of State A, conducted the operation through HG.\n## 2. The Relationship Between State B and HG State A, knowing that factual attribution achieves little in cyber proxy circumstances,²¹⁰ focuses on legally attributing HG’s operation to State B.²¹¹ Accordingly, State A conducts an investigation into State B and HG’s relationship.\n**State B transferred Tartarus to HG.** State B transferred the cyber weapon,²¹² Tartarus, to HG. State B designed Tartarus’s capability to (explaining that protective relays in electric utility operations deactivates a system when it “suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system”).\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems²¹³ used by State A’s energy industry.²¹⁴ Further, State B created the portion of Tartarus that undermined the power grid’s protective relays, causing unprotected power surges and fires.²¹⁵ State B supports HG. State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests. Days before the attack, an investigative reporting company, incorporated in Zero-Day Hacking Techniques, WIRED (Apr. 6, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://bit.ly/3k7Kgbr (providing a map of zero-day exploit usage among States, showing some States, which are known to be behind the international curve on developing cyber capabilities, using zero-day exploits; suggesting that these States bought the zero-days instead of developing or discovering them). The sale of zero-day exploits can be categorized as a form of espionage and therefore, does not play a major role in this Comment.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³ ## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test Assuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Tran²²⁹ pursue an antidote to this dilemma, but their solutions ultimately lack efficacy in cyberspace.\n## 4. Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions Although the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴ Notably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test This Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] that the enabling State exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.²⁴⁶ Thus, the two-part test imposes liability on a State for enabling a cyber operation and exercising overall control over the non-State actor conducting it.\n\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰ Technical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] the wild” shield²⁶³—that accused States hide behind.²⁶⁴ Essentially, requiring the victim State to prove both forms of enablement would make the CECT a non-starter if the tools used in the operation were previously known.²⁶⁵ Enablement of a cyber operation should be considered under a totality of the circumstances analysis.²⁶⁶ Two potential circumstances to consider are the nature of the exploit and its target.²⁶⁷ An exploit can be damage-enabling or non-damage-enabling.²⁶⁸ For example, a zero-day exploit that enables a spyware program to self-propagate differs from a zero-day exploit wielding malware program that compromises the integrity of a power grid’s protective relays.²⁶⁹ Accordingly, States that create and transfer damage-enabling exploits should be responsible for the damage caused by those exploits when their proxies use them against other States.²⁷⁰ In addition, a targeting analysis should focus on the exploits specific target, not necessarily the general network or system that the cyber operation targets.²⁷¹ Essentially, a zero-day exploit that seeks to gain access to a power grid’s network targets the power grid; in contrast, a zero-day exploit that corrupts that same power grid’s protective relays targets\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶ ## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical First, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION With powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰² While victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴ PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²"

Westphal*\n## ABSTRACT\nCurrently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective\n* J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents\nI.

INTRODUCTION\nOn August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n1.

BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n39.

Cyber-Attacks Versus Kinetic Attacks\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62\nCyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially\n55. See infra Section II.B. When information security personnel are discussing attribution, they are often referring to who conducted the cyber-attack. See Kristen E. Eichensehr, The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA L. REV. 520, 524 (2020). Throughout this Comment, attribution also refers to non-State actors’ conduct being attributed to State actors.\n56.

Legal Attribution for State Responsibility\nThe cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶\n“Legal attribution . . . deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State . . . to the [victim] State . . . ; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n109. *Id.* at 34.\n110.

International Law Standards for Legal Attribution\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³\nThe ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷\nFurthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must . . . be shown that this ‘effective control’ was\n119.

Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴\nBecause the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶\nIn 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷ . . . agreed in a consensus report . . . that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n129.

International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n139. *Id.*\n140.

State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests.

See id.\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n833\nState A, published a documentary about State B’s war crimes during a previous armed conflict²¹⁸ with State C.²¹⁹\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³\n## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test\nAssuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and\n218.

Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions\nAlthough the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴\nNotably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n229. See Tran, supra note 156, at 376.\n230. See Margulies, supra note 60, at 514.\n231. See id. at 514–15; see also Jane Perlez, Tribunal Rejects Beijing’s Claims in South China Sea, N.Y.

In response to the tribunal’s decision, China’s Foreign Ministry described the decision as “invalid and has no binding force,” and “China does not accept or recognize [the decision].” Id. In reality, China’s actions in the South China Sea are plainly inconsistent with the Law of the Sea, which China is a party to. See id. Accordingly, Margulies’s expectation of bad-faith States’ willingness to voluntary cooperate in potentially adverse rulings may be overly optimistic.\n232. See U.N. Charter art. 51 (“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”).\n233.

First, *in camera* and *ex parte* proceedings would require unprecedented levels of States’ consent.²³⁸ For example, accused States must consent to an application of the VCT and to be bound by a judgement based on evidence that the State cannot examine or refute.²³⁹ Second, victim States would need to turn over evidence, gathered by secretive means, to a factfinder, whose system cannot be assumed to be free of cyber intruders.²⁴⁰ Third, the cyber attribution problem cannot be characterized as a red herring;²⁴¹ a new standard that fails to consider the nuances of the cyber domain repeats the issues resulting from applying kinetic standards to cyber operations.²⁴²\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test\nThis Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show\n238. See Perlez, *supra* note 231 (reporting on China’s decision to not give an adverse international decision legitimacy by not participating in it).\n239. See Tran, *supra* note 156, at 424 (suggesting cyber attribution factfinders should use *in camera* and *ex parte* proceedings).\n240. See *id.* at 426. Regardless of the standard being applied, victim States hoping to legally attribute an operation will need to disclose secrets; a standard that assumes the factfinder’s network would be completely secure forgets a fundamental canon of cybersecurity: no system is truly secure, there are only degrees of security. See Nicole Perlroth &amp; Scott Shane, *In Baltimore and Beyond, a Stolen N.S.A. Tool Wreaks Havoc*, N.Y.

See Rid &amp; Buchanan, *supra* note 70, at 4 (looking at the technical and tactical levels of a cyber operation to glean attribution information). The CECT includes a State action element because passive enablement or sanctioning the presence of attackers creates too many issues. See Ashley S. Deeks, “*Unwilling or Unable*”: *Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense*, 52 VA. J.

Tactical and Technical Enablement\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰\nTechnical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n246. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A, Appeal Judgment, ¶ 122 (Int'l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia July 15, 1999).\n247. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4.\n248. See Perlroth &amp; Shane, supra note 240 (highlighting the consequences of the Shadow Brokers, an elusive hacking group, leaking the N.S.A.'s EternalBlue hacking tool, including, North Korea, Russia, and China using the tool in cyber operations). This Comment does not wade into the issue of whether the United States should be liable for the damage that its leaked tools cause.\n249. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17 (discussing the importance of analyzing a cyber operation's target). Using a zero-day exploit does not violate international law. See David A. Wallace et al., Peeling Back the Onion of Cyber Espionage After Tallinn 2.0, 78 Md. L. Rev. 205, 221–24 (explaining the Tallinn Manual's experts' conclusions on whether cyber espionage violates international law in peacetime and wartime circumstances). Notably, low-impact cyber operations occur in the \"cyber gray zone\" and may include zero days. See Schmitt, \"Virtual\" Disenfranchisement, supra note 75, at 30 (categorizing operations in the cyber gray zone as operations that do rise to the level of a use of force or an armed attack). Essentially, this Comment argues that enabling a cyber operation, via a damage-enabling zero-day exploit, should be considered in the CECT's analysis, regardless of the operation's IHL categorization.\n250. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17–18 (explaining that “infrastructure is required for most malicious activities”). For example, DDoS attacks rely on infected machines, bots, as the infrastructure (means) to launch the attack. A perpetrator’s reuse of infrastructure aids the attribution process in ways similar to footprints at a crime scene. See id; see also Trickbot: U.S. Court Order Hits Botnet’s Infrastructure, SYMANTEC (Oct. 12, 2020), https://bit.ly/39nj3hD (detailing a takedown operation that targeted the Trickbot botnet, one of the largest and problematic botnets in recent years).\n251. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 10 (referring to the technical aspects of an attack as \"the how\"). Thus, in this Comment, technical enablement refers to a State enabling a non-State actor with information on how to conduct a cyber operation or how to manipulate a target's weaknesses.\n252. See Bruce Schneier, Should U.S. Hackers Fix Cybersecurity Holes or Exploit Them?, THE ATL. (May 19, 2014), https://bit.ly/3boiDtO (explaining the debate of disclosing zero-day vulnerabilities or weaponizing them).\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n837\nnot include situations where a State discloses a zero-day vulnerability to a software developer or security researchers.²⁵³ Technical enablement could be implied when showing tactical enablement if the State provides tactical means, which includes technical information within it.²⁵⁴ Tactical enablement refers to States providing the means used for the operation.²⁵⁵ Providing the means for a cyber operation could refer to funding and organizing the perpetrators or it could refer to the transfer of command-and-control servers. Furthermore, creating the means for an operation could refer to the creation of custom malware to exploit a certain target.²⁵⁶ For example, a State could enter an adversary’s network,²⁵⁷ map that network,²⁵⁸ and create custom malware specifically designed to compromise that network or the infrastructure it oversees.²⁵⁹ Transferring that malware or the means to control it once it infects the target could satisfy tactical enablement.\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in\n253. See id.\n254. For example, the Tartarus malware in the hypothetical included a damage-enabling exploit. See supra Section III.A.\n255.

See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 53, at 193 (defining cyber espionage as “any act undertaken clandestinely or under false pretenses that uses cyber capabilities to gather (or attempt to gather) information with the intention of communicating it to the opposing party”). Therefore, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, mapping a network in peacetime would not violate international law. See Wallace et al., supra note 249, at 221–24 (explaining the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s experts’ conclusions on cyber espionage’s lawfulness).\n259.

See Perlroth &amp; Shane, supra note 240 (explaining the proliferation of the United States’ leaked hacking tools, which North Korea and Russia weaponized).\n264. See David E. Sanger &amp; Nicole Perlroth, FireEye, a Top Cybersecurity Firm, Says it was Hacked by a Nation-State, N.Y. Times (Feb. 6, 2021), https://nyti.ms/3s42ejg (noting that an attacker’s use of leaked or stolen hacking tools reduces that attacker’s identifying footprint).\n265. See id. (suggesting that attackers will weaponize others’ leaked tools to protect their own tools from being burned).\n266. The CECT, like the Q-Model, recognizes that cyber attribution is not perfect and is “what States make of it.” Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4. Further, drawing a firm line for enablement would only create a State responsibility lighthouse for bad-faith actors to steer clear from. A “but for” standard could incentivize States to leak the tools prior to the attack and subsequently claim that the non-State actors obtained the tools from a public source. See Schneier, supra note 252.\n267. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 16–17 (noting an operation’s target can shed light on the attacker’s identity).\n268. For instance, a damage-enabling exploit could grant the attacker control over a system that, if manipulated in a certain manner, could cause physical damage or harm to objects or persons.\n269. See Wallace et al., supra note 249, at 221–24 (explaining that espionage does not violate international law). Physical destruction of a power grid, however, violates the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force. U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n270. An analysis’ inclusion of exploits that proximately enable damage would create nexus issues that may overly broaden State responsibility. See Bosnia Genocide, Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, ¶¶ 404–06 (Feb. 26) (rejecting the overall control test for unnecessarily broadening State responsibility).\n271. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 17 (explaining the importance of analyzing the attacker’s target once inside the targeted system).\n2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n839\nthe protective relays.²⁷² Essentially, tactical and technical enablement focus on the “how” and “what” of the operation, and the subsequent part of the CECT, overall control, focuses on the operational and strategical support provide by the State.²⁷³\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n272. See The Epic Turla Operation, SECURELIST (Aug. 7, 2014), https://bit.ly/3sep73t (analyzing operation “Epic Turla,” where hackers compromised various government and military computer systems; once inside those systems, the attackers searched them for documents related to “NATO” and “[EU] energy dialogue,” suggesting the attackers were not States privy to NATO or EU energy dialogue information).\n273. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 4.\n274. This portion of the test draws from the overall control test, formulated by the ICTY in Tadic. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A, Appeal Judgment, ¶ 122 (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia July 15, 1999).\n275. See id. ¶ 131 (“[A] State wield[s] overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”).\n276. International law does not prohibit reconnaissance and preparation, which essentially amounts to espionage, but both should nevertheless be considered when evaluating the CECT’s overall control portion. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 53, at 170 (noting that cyber espionage by itself does not violate international law, unless the spying State’s espionage violates one of its international legal obligations to another State).\n277. See Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-A ¶ 122.\n278. See Hathaway et al., supra note 153, at 543.\n279. See id.\n280. See Nicaragua, Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, ¶ 115 (June 27).\n281. See id. (emphasizing that to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise overall control in the course of which the alleged violations took place).\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 126:3]\nUnder the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³\nIn sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶\n## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical\nFirst, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n282. See id.\n283. See id.\n284. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 7 (noting that cyber attribution revolves around minimizing uncertainty about the attackers identity).\n285.

From there, State B issued conditional instructions to HG, telling them to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened the national interests or reputation of State B. Notably, State B did not instruct HG to use Tartarus against State A’s power grid.²⁹⁴ Overall control does not demand such specific instructions;²⁹⁵ instead, the instructions and coordination can be general in nature.²⁹⁶ State B issued implicit targeting instructions to HG when State B gifted HG a custom malware capable of melting State A’s power grid.²⁹⁷\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWith powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰²\nWhile victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴\n293.

Westphal* ## ABSTRACT Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective * J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n# Table of Contents I.

CONCLUSION...841 2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL On August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Numerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹² Notably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nConsequently, cyber-deficient States turn to the international community for attribution assistance.¹⁸ Currently, an international cyber attribution mechanism does not exist, resulting in cyber-deficient states turning to existing international bodies, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁹ for attribution assistance.²⁰ The International Court of Justice serves as the United Nations’ “principal judicial organ.”²¹ In prior proxy cases, the ICJ applied the effective control test.²² Under the effective control test, to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise effective control over the non-State actor for the specific operation(s) subject to litigation.²³ The ICJ rejected a less demanding standard, the overall control test,²⁴ and reaffirmed the effective control test as its standard for proxy attribution.²⁵ Unfortunately, the effective control test lacks efficacy in the cyber domain; multiple scholars criticize the effective control test as being impractical for cyber operations.²⁶ Some scholars, such as Yuval Shany and Michael N. Schmitt, have proposed an international cyber attribution mechanism to address the lack of State accountability in the cyber domain.²⁷ Unfortunately, Shany and Schmitt’s idea remains on standby PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] until international political willpower elevates their idea to acceptance and implementation.²⁸ In recognition of the cyber domain’s seemingly never-ending regulatory purgatory,²⁹ this Comment accepts existing international organizations but advocates for the effective control test’s replacement.³⁰ This Comment presents a cyber-focused test that fills the gaps left by the effective control test’s application to a proxy-executed cyber operation.³¹ This Comment suggests a new two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”).³² The CECT’s first part analyzes the technical and tactical enablement of the operation—an analysis that the effective control test omits.³³ The second part mimics the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia’s (ICTY) overall control test.³⁴ In Part II, this Comment introduces the intricacies of the cyber domain, current cyber attribution practices, and international attribution standards.³⁵ Next, this Comment highlights the problems of the current international cyber regulatory dynamic for proxy-executed cyber operations and includes previously presented solutions to address these issues.³⁶ In Part III, this Comment presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how the current standards and previously suggested solutions fail.³⁷ This Comment then recommends a new standard, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), to rectify current failures.³⁸\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## II. BACKGROUND\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## B. Cyber Attribution Methods\nCyber attribution models are meant to determine factual attribution77 for a cyber operation.78 Cybersecurity experts do not profess an industry standard for factual attribution.79\nThis Comment focuses on the Q Model,80 one of the few publicly available and academically articulated cyber attribution models.81 The Q Model attempts to improve the cyber attribution process by “minimi[z]ing uncertainty” through three levels of analysis: (1) technical;82 (2)\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] operational;83 and (3) strategic.84 The technical level pursues the “how”; the operational level determines the “what,” and the strategic goal asks “who” and “why.”85 A Q Model analysis begins at the technical level, the foundation for the attribution process.86 The technical level considers how the attackers entered the system;87 what they looked for upon entrance;88 if their patterns-of-life indicate geographical regions;89 if there are any indicators of compromise present;90 the language used in the code comments; and if applicable, mistakes.91 Some technical aspects of an attack indicate State involvement.92 For example, a cyber-attack’s attempt to be stealthy can reveal its desire to remain undetected, its concern for having the attack attributed to its conductor, and to a certain extent, the operation’s overall sophistication.93 Furthermore, States with agencies or military departments with sophisticated cyber capabilities often employ legal oversight.94 Essentially, the cyber-attack’s targeting behavior, or what it chooses not to attack, can indicate the involvement of lawyers in the operation’s development.95 The technical level feeds clues to the operational level by beginning to paint a picture of the attacker’s identity.96 The operational level uses the technical level’s findings to explain non-technical and geopolitical aspects of the attack.97 For example, the\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nOn the strategic level, findings from the technical and operational levels are aggregated to draw conclusions.104 One of the more pressing strategic aspects revolves around damage, which is separated into four categories, two of which this Comment focuses on105: (1) direct and immediate106 and (2) direct and delayed.107 Moreover, damage can be “intended but not realized” or, the opposite, “realized but not intended.”108 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Beyond damage, an inquiry into the strategic level will ask “who benefited the most” and “who was damaged most[.]”¹⁰⁹ After a Q-Model investigation, uncertainty will be minimized to a degree,¹¹⁰ and factual attribution will likely be achieved. However, whether the cyber-attack can be legally attributed remains unanswered.¹¹¹ ## C. Legal Attribution for State Responsibility The cyber domain’s lack of treaty and customary international law results in a lack of evidentiary standards for when a cyber-attack can be legally attributed to a State.¹¹² Factually attributing a cyber-attack to an accused State’s proxy provides victim States with little relief because countermeasures¹¹³ are not authorized against non-State actors.¹¹⁴ Essentially, a victim State, having factually attributed a State’s proxy’s cyber operation, cannot respond against either of them.¹¹⁵ Therefore, for the accused State to bear responsibility for its proxy’s cyber operation, the victim State must show legal attribution.¹¹⁶ “Legal attribution... deals with the conditions precedent to a finding that a State is responsible for a cyber operation pursuant to the secondary rules of international law set forth in the law of State responsibility.”¹¹⁷ In the cyber context, States are responsible for cyber operations when: “[(1)] the cyber operations involved have breached an obligation owed by the [responsible] State... to the [victim] State...; and [(2)] that the operations [are] attributable to the former as a legal matter.”¹¹⁸ For the first part, a cyber proxy operation that falls within the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s definition of “cyber-attack” likely breaches the controlling State’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³ The ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷ Furthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro).¹²⁸ The ICJ explained that “[i]t must... be shown that this ‘effective control’ was PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups... having committed the violations.”¹²⁹ Despite this elaboration, scholars criticize the effective control test as being too high of a bar, which leaves victim States reluctant to reach for it.¹³⁰ The ICTY, in Prosecutor v. Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴ Because the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶ In 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷... agreed in a consensus report... that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. International Cyber Attribution Standard for State and Non-State Actors\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0’s Rule 17 attempts to provide a rule for the attribution of cyber operations by non-State actors.¹⁴¹ Rule 17 states that “[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control;¹⁴² or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operation as its own.”¹⁴³ The latter of these options would rarely be utilized because a bad-faith actor eliminates its plausible deniability by admitting to wrongdoing.¹⁴⁴ Further, some States, despite overwhelming and seemingly undeniable evidence,¹⁴⁵ assert they refrain from conducting offensive cyber operations altogether.¹⁴⁶\nTo satisfy Rule 17(a)’s need for direction and control, the international groups of experts (IGEs) agreed that the ICJ’s use of “effective control,” as applied in *Nicaragua* and *Bosnia Genocide*, “captures the scope of the concept.”¹⁴⁷ Thus, under the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-State actor’s actions are attributable to a State “whenever it is the State that determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] of that operation.”¹⁴⁸ While the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides insights into how the effective control test could play out in cyberspace, States are not legally bound by the Tallinn Manual 2.0.¹⁴⁹ Consequently, the effective control test remains the ICJ standard for State responsibility, even in cyberspace, where States and non-State actors enjoy an added layer of obscurity and therefore, plausible deniability.¹⁵⁰ ## 3. Proposed Solutions to Rectify the Shortcomings of the Effective Control Test Scholars question the effective control test’s viability in cyberspace and take different approaches in rectifying its perceived shortcomings.¹⁵¹ Prominent scholars, including Oona A. Hathaway, the Director of the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum and Center of Global Legal Challenges,¹⁵² and her colleagues critique the effective control test generally and suggest broadening State responsibility by imposing liability on States that fail to ensure that the non-State actors that they support ensure respect for international law.¹⁵³ Peter Margulies,¹⁵⁴ professor of law at Roger Williams and another expert in security law, suggests a new standard altogether,¹⁵⁵ which Delbert Tran builds on and provides procedural suggestions for.¹⁵⁶ **Ensure respect principle.** In the article, *Ensuring Responsibility: Common Article 1 and State Responsibility For Non-State Actors*, authors Oona Hathaway et al., suggest that States, through Common\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n**Virtual control test.** In the article, *Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility*, author Peter Margulies presents a novel construction, the virtual control test (VCT).¹⁶² “Under the virtual control test, a victim State that has demonstrated that another nation funded or equipped a non-State actor can hold the second State responsible for the non-State actor’s cyber-attacks, unless the second State rebuts the presumption of responsibility.”¹⁶³ A State accused of exercising virtual control over a group “may rebut that presumption through cooperation in the victim State’s attribution efforts.”¹⁶⁴ **In camera and ex parte hearings.** In a student-written note, Delbert Tran presents a procedural framework for applying the VCT.¹⁶⁵ Tran, who viewed the technical attribution of a cyber-attack as a red herring,¹⁶⁶ attempts to provide procedural rules that would safeguard States’ covertly gathered intelligence.¹⁶⁷ To achieve this end, Tran suggests that the factfinder should employ *in camera*¹⁶⁸ and *ex parte* hearings.¹⁶⁹ Under this system, a State that wishes to keep its intelligence information and capabilities a secret would present the evidence to the factfinder and the accused State would presumably never see the evidence nor have the opportunity to refute it.¹⁷⁰ --- ¹⁵⁸.

ANALYSIS The existing cyber attribution standards are inadequate to properly legally attribute non-State actors’ operations to controlling States.¹⁷⁴ To demonstrate the inadequacy of both the effective control test¹⁷⁵ and the previously suggested solutions,¹⁷⁶ this Comment uses a hypothetical scenario that relies on real-world cyber operations and capabilities.¹⁷⁷ Following the hypothetical scenario and criticisms of previously suggested solutions, this Comment presents and then applies a technology and control-based test.¹⁷⁸ The hypothetical serves two purposes: (1) to further demonstrate how kinetic attacks and cyber-attacks are functionally and practically different, and (2) to highlight the potentially absurd results occurring from applying kinetic attribution standards to the cyber domain. In the hypothetical scenario, State A suffers a cyber-attack conducted by State B’s proxy, a group called Hacker Group (“HG”). This hypothetical scenario uses realistic technical and tactical means of attack¹⁷⁹ and demonstrates where the current international standards fail.¹⁸⁰ ## A. Hypothetical Cyber-Attack Scenario State A suffered a cyber-attack that rises to the level of an armed attack under IHL.¹⁸¹ A cyber-weapon, in the form of malware, attacked\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUsing the Q Model,¹⁸³ State A discovered the following to be true. Beginning with the technical level,¹⁸⁴ State A realizes that an employee accidentally downloaded remote access software¹⁸⁵ into the power grid’s system by downloading a spearphishing email’s malicious file.¹⁸⁶ Because State A’s power grid was neither encrypted¹⁸⁷ nor segmented,¹⁸⁸ the attackers obtained other employees’ log-in information, freely moved throughout the network, and undermined the integrity of grid’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition’s (SCADA)¹⁸⁹ security audit logging function.¹⁹⁰ To manipulate the logging function, the actors used a PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] zero-day exploit¹⁹¹ to insert a rootkit¹⁹² that would disguise a remote user as a non-remote user if an auditor reviewed the logs.¹⁹³ Three weeks later, HG, a hacking group located within State B and long rumored to be sponsored by State B, downloaded a custom malware,¹⁹⁴ Tartarus,¹⁹⁵ onto the power grid’s programmable logic controllers.¹⁹⁶ Tartarus’s code packaging times¹⁹⁷ conformed with State B’s six-day, eight-hour work schedule,¹⁹⁸ and the code itself contained slang commonly used in State B.¹⁹⁹ On the operational level,²⁰⁰ the overall attack occurred in three stages.²⁰¹ Phase one shut off the power, resulting in hospitals, home heating systems, and the like becoming ineffective.²⁰² Phase two created chaos by switching the power back on; because a portion of Tartarus’s payload neutralized the power grid’s protective relays,²⁰³ the power’s\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nIn phase three, the cyber-attackers triggered Tartarus’s wiper function, permanently deleting the computers’ data.²⁰⁶ At this point the attackers had ceased their operation but its effects continued. The lack of power caused traffic jams, further increasing emergency response times to put out the fires.\nOn the strategic level,²⁰⁷ the attackers must have tested the malware before unleashing it on State A.²⁰⁸ Moreover, State C, a former republic of State B, had experienced similar blackouts that it attributed to HG.²⁰⁹ At this point, State A factually attributed the cyber-attack to HG but doubted HG’s ability to conduct the operation without State support. State A suspected that State B, a regional rival of State A, conducted the operation through HG.\n## 2. The Relationship Between State B and HG State A, knowing that factual attribution achieves little in cyber proxy circumstances,²¹⁰ focuses on legally attributing HG’s operation to State B.²¹¹ Accordingly, State A conducts an investigation into State B and HG’s relationship.\n**State B transferred Tartarus to HG.** State B transferred the cyber weapon,²¹² Tartarus, to HG. State B designed Tartarus’s capability to (explaining that protective relays in electric utility operations deactivates a system when it “suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system”).\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] exploit the zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA systems²¹³ used by State A’s energy industry.²¹⁴ Further, State B created the portion of Tartarus that undermined the power grid’s protective relays, causing unprotected power surges and fires.²¹⁵ State B supports HG. State B indirectly paid large amounts of money to HG, which are traceable to State B’s intelligence agencies. What is more, State B supplied and equipped HG with the necessary hardware and network access required to conduct the cyber operation.\nState B organized HG. When State B decided to advance its capabilities in cyber space, State B held hacking contests at its universities as a means of recruiting the cyber-savvy.²¹⁶ In addition, State B would contact emerging hacking groups located within State B and task them with espionage assignments.²¹⁷ From these two recruiting pools, State B created and organized HG.\nState B issued instructions to HG. Prior to the cyber-attack, State A’s intelligence agency intercepted a communication between State B and HG. In that communication, State B instructed HG to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened State B’s reputation or interests. Days before the attack, an investigative reporting company, incorporated in Zero-Day Hacking Techniques, WIRED (Apr. 6, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://bit.ly/3k7Kgbr (providing a map of zero-day exploit usage among States, showing some States, which are known to be behind the international curve on developing cyber capabilities, using zero-day exploits; suggesting that these States bought the zero-days instead of developing or discovering them). The sale of zero-day exploits can be categorized as a form of espionage and therefore, does not play a major role in this Comment.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nWith all of the evidence collected, State A could likely factually attribute the operation to HG but cannot engage in countermeasures against HG, a non-State actor.²²⁰ Furthermore, because State A can only prove factual attribution of the operation to State B’s proxy, not State B itself, State A cannot lawfully act against State B.²²¹ In addition, State A taking action against State B assumes that State A could economically and militarily manage State B’s response.²²² Despite an expected reluctance, State A’s most peaceful option would be to ask the ICJ to hold State B responsible for the operation.²²³ ## 3. Applying the Effective Control Test Assuming State A can prove State B’s relationship with HG and all the information about the cyber-attack, the ICJ’s effective control test would still not be satisfied.²²⁴ Even if it could be shown that State B funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected targets for, and planned the above operation, the evidence would still be insufficient to satisfy the effective control test.²²⁵ Therefore, even with uncontroverted evidence of State B enabling the cyber operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, and even with uncontroverted evidence of State B funding, recruiting, organizing, and instructing HG, State A still cannot satisfy the effective control test’s minimum.²²⁶ Scholars like Hathaway,²²⁷ Margulies,²²⁸ and PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Tran²²⁹ pursue an antidote to this dilemma, but their solutions ultimately lack efficacy in cyberspace.\n## 4. Criticisms of Previously Proposed Solutions Although the VCT²³⁰ lowers the high bar of the effective control test, the VCT assumes bad-faith States’ cooperation after a cyber-attack.²³¹ If a State refuses to offer such assistance, and if the attack rises to the level of an armed attack under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter,²³² then the victim State would be authorized to use force²³³ against the uncooperative State.²³⁴ Notably, a VCT application would have no effect on the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.²³⁵ Moreover, a standard that leaves victim States resorting to force assumes that the victim State wields the capability to do so and can manage response of the accused state.\nMargulies concludes by noting that States enjoying the benefits of cyber proxy relationships will reject the VCT, which Margulies argues as evidence of the VCT’s value.²³⁶ However, that argument assumes the VCT’s perfection. Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nMargulies and Tran offer solutions that lower the effective control test’s demands but do not consider the unwillingness of States to submit to impending adverse decisions²⁴³ or the technical aspects of cyber operations.²⁴⁴ Accordingly, the effective control test’s replacement must consider both.\n## B. The Cyber Enablement and Control Test This Comment creates and advocates for the use of the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (“CECT”), which employs two parts to evaluate State responsibility for cyber-attacks. First, the victim State must show that a State action directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the operation.²⁴⁵ Second, the victim State must show PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] that the enabling State exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.²⁴⁶ Thus, the two-part test imposes liability on a State for enabling a cyber operation and exercising overall control over the non-State actor conducting it.\n\nFirst, the victim State must show that the controlling State directly, technically, or tactically enabled the non-State actor.²⁴⁷ Markedly, the CECT includes a requirement to not impose liability on a State when its hacking tools are stolen or disclosed.²⁴⁸ Technical enablement refers to the necessary technical information to carry out the operation,²⁴⁹ and tactical enablement refers to the means utilized in the cyber operation.²⁵⁰ Technical enablement centers around information sharing between States and non-State actors.²⁵¹ More specifically, the CECT addresses situations where a State actor discloses a zero-day exploit to a non-State actor for malicious purposes.²⁵² Importantly, technical enablement does\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nThe victim State’s requirement to show technical or tactical enablement recognizes that cyber-attackers recycle tools from their own and others’ operations.²⁶⁰ There can be lag times between the burning²⁶¹ of a zero-day exploit and a subsequent patch from the software developer.²⁶² By not requiring a victim state to show both forms of enablement, the CECT strikes down another shield—“the exploit is out in PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] the wild” shield²⁶³—that accused States hide behind.²⁶⁴ Essentially, requiring the victim State to prove both forms of enablement would make the CECT a non-starter if the tools used in the operation were previously known.²⁶⁵ Enablement of a cyber operation should be considered under a totality of the circumstances analysis.²⁶⁶ Two potential circumstances to consider are the nature of the exploit and its target.²⁶⁷ An exploit can be damage-enabling or non-damage-enabling.²⁶⁸ For example, a zero-day exploit that enables a spyware program to self-propagate differs from a zero-day exploit wielding malware program that compromises the integrity of a power grid’s protective relays.²⁶⁹ Accordingly, States that create and transfer damage-enabling exploits should be responsible for the damage caused by those exploits when their proxies use them against other States.²⁷⁰ In addition, a targeting analysis should focus on the exploits specific target, not necessarily the general network or system that the cyber operation targets.²⁷¹ Essentially, a zero-day exploit that seeks to gain access to a power grid’s network targets the power grid; in contrast, a zero-day exploit that corrupts that same power grid’s protective relays targets\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\n\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶ ## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical First, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n## IV. CONCLUSION With powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰² While victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴ PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Some scholars, recognizing the resulting State responsibility gap, propose optimistic solutions to address the effective control test's defects.³⁰⁵ However, these solutions either go too far in refining the effective control test³⁰⁶ or fail to recognize the cyber domain's uniqueness.³⁰⁷ This Comment proposes the CECT to properly address the matter.³⁰⁸ The CECT, through its technical and tactical enablement portion, embodies the demands of the effective control test by focusing on State involvement on an operation-specific level.³⁰⁹ In addition, the CECT's second portion, overall control, places responsibility on States that use cyber proxies to breach obligations owed to other States.³¹⁰ By satisfying the CECT, States can legally attribute cyber operations to those who are responsible for them and can lawfully act against those actors.³¹¹ Without a means of legal attribution, cyber-deficient States remain at the mercy of the cyber-powerful and their proxies.³¹²"

BACKGROUND\n\nBinding international law comes from two main sources: treaties and customary international law.⁴⁰ Treaties are means for States to cooperate⁴¹ and create binding but beneficial relationships with one another.⁴² Treaties can create affirmative obligations or a duty to refrain from certain acts.⁴³ State practice and States’ sense of legal obligation to conform to that practice, *opinio juris*, creates customary international law.⁴⁴\nFor cyber domain treaties, no “Law of Cyber” exists.⁴⁵ For customary international law, cyberspace’s relatively new presence as a warfighting domain leaves States without much State practice and *opinio juris* to root their behavior.⁴⁶ Without a treaty or definitive customary international law, governments and scholars apply existing international humanitarian law (IHL)⁴⁷ to cyber operations.⁴⁸ Although, kinetic conflicts spurred the\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] existing rules' formulation and applying them to the cyber domain leaves accountability gaps for States.⁴⁹ One such gap, and the primary focus of this Comment, is States using non-State actors to conduct malicious cyber activities to avoid international responsibility for those non-State actors and their activities.⁵⁰ ## A. Defining Cyber-Attack In addition to a lack of international regulation, States differ on what constitutes a “cyber-attack.”⁵¹ Different areas of the law treat the term “attack” differently, each having their own legal implications.⁵² This Comment uses the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s⁵³ definition of a cyber-attack, which states that “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁴\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\nTo understand cyber attribution,55 one must recognize the difference between kinetic56 and cyber-attacks. Cyber weapons are different than traditional, kinetic weapons, such as missiles or arms.57 Cyber weapons are more obscure, such as lines of complex computer code58 or access to a botnet.59 Furthermore, tracing a cyber weapon’s origins poses different, more difficult challenges than tracking a missile.60 Missiles can be tracked from launch to impact.61 Notably, a deployed cyber weapon can operate undetected for years and even erase its footprints.62 Cyber weapons are easier for non-State actors to obtain and deploy than kinetic weapons.63 For kinetic weapons, a non-State actor financially PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] capable of obtaining missiles or other military weapon systems⁶⁴ are likely notorious enough to warrant monitoring by State intelligence agencies.⁶⁵ Furthermore, established mechanisms and arms agreements regulate kinetic weapons and their transfer, while no such mechanisms or agreements regulate cyber weapons.⁶⁶ Meanwhile, cyber weapons can be held, developed, and unleashed by any actor that attains the appropriate computing power, network connection, and knowledge.⁶⁷ A cyber-attack’s results can also be different.⁶⁸ A kinetic attack’s results are usually easily and visually assessed, such as explosions, destroyed buildings, and injured civilians or military personnel.⁶⁹ In contrast to kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks can have a much weaker nexus between launch and damage.⁷⁰ Cyber-attack damage falls into one of four categories: (1) direct and immediate;⁷¹ (2) direct and delayed;⁷² (3) indirect (2015) (explaining the dangers of non-State actors having easy access to the ever-increasing cyber domain and all of its potential for violence, terrorism, and warfare).\n2022] CYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n\n---\n\n## ## 2. Overall Control During the Operation\n\nSecond, the victim State must show that the State exercised overall control over the non-State actors during the operation.²⁷⁴ Essentially, overall control can be shown when a State coordinates or substantially facilitates the planning and coordination of the operation.²⁷⁵\nNotably, “during an operation” includes a cyber operation’s reconnaissance and preparation under the CECT.²⁷⁶ During pre-operation stages, overall control focuses on the State’s relationship with the non-State actor, not whether the two are acting lawfully.²⁷⁷ Although, Hathaway’s concerns about States being responsible for non-State actors’ ultra vires acts will be implicated if the CECT considers a State’s pre-operation behavior.²⁷⁸ These concerns are safeguarded by the CECT’s enablement portion and need no further discussion.²⁷⁹\nIn addition, by looking at the pre-operation relationship between the State and non-State actor, the CECT addresses a weakness of the effective control test.²⁸⁰ Specifically, the CECT holds States accountable who technically or tactically enable an operation and wield overall control over a group, only to step back at the time of the cyber operation’s execution.²⁸¹\nPENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] Under the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³ In sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation.

Westphal*\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\nCurrently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective\n\n* J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022.

To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario.\n\nAfter highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\nI.

    "2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n811\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nOn August 28, 2013, an Iranian hacker dubbed Firoozi gained unauthorized access to the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. If the dam's sluice gate had not been disconnected for maintenance, Firoozi's level of access would have enabled him to manipulate the gate. Although the Bowman Dam is quite small, Firoozi's attempted tampering concerned United States officials because an actor gained unauthorized, remote access to a portion of the United States' critical infrastructure. Three years later, the United States indicted Firoozi and his co-conspirators for hacking into the dam under the direction of the Iranian military.\n\nEven if Firoozi had successfully manipulated the dam and caused damage, Firoozi's punishment, an indictment in the United States federal court system, would not change. Further, unless the United States presented evidence of Iran exercising effective control over Firoozi during the operation, then Iran too would escape responsibility for its proxy's actions.\n\n1.

    "PENN STATE LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 126:3]\n\nNumerous empires and governments have enjoyed the benefits of proxy relationships to achieve lawful and unlawful ends.⁸ States⁹ rely on proxies to assert plausible deniability,¹⁰ allowing States to subvert international law and engage in activities that lack public support.¹¹ States also use proxies in the cyber domain, further exacerbating plausible deniability and obscurity.¹²\n\nNotably, the United States’ cyber capabilities deter most States and their proxies from conducting destructive cyber operations against it.¹³ The United States has spent billions of dollars developing its cyber warfare capabilities and defenses.¹⁴ The other considerable players in the cyber domain are: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel, and the United Kingdom.¹⁵ These States “appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent\n\n8.

International Law Standards for Legal Attribution\n\nTwo standards—the effective control test and the overall control test—have emerged from international law jurisprudence to determine when a State bears responsibility for the actions of a non-State actor.¹²⁰ The ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)¹²¹ created the two tests in response to kinetic conflicts.¹²² Notably, neither test has been applied to cyber operations.¹²³\n\nThe ICJ created the effective control test in its Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.) decision.¹²⁴ In Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government accused the United States of using the Contras, an opposition movement within Nicaragua, to battle with the Sandinista government.¹²⁵ The ICJ concluded that for the United States to be held legally accountable for the Contras’ actions, “it would in principle have to be proved that [the United States] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”¹²⁶ In applying the effective control test, the ICJ noted that even if the evidence proved that the United States funded, organized, supplied, equipped, selected the targets, and planned the operations, the evidence would still not be enough to attribute the Contras’ actions to the United States.¹²⁷\n\nFurthermore, the ICJ later elaborated on the effective control test in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v.

Tadic, rejected the effective control test and applied the overall control test instead.¹³¹ Under the overall control test, the non-State actor must be, as a whole, “under the overall control of the State.”¹³² A State “wields overall control [of a] group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity.”¹³³ The ICJ later rejected the ICTY’s overall control test because the ICJ viewed the test to unnecessarily broaden State responsibility.¹³⁴\n\nBecause the ICJ demands the effective control test, and because States find plausible deniability in proxies, the cyber domain’s current landscape draws comparisons to the “Wild West.”¹³⁵ International bodies, recognizing the dangers of a cyber wild west, discourage the use of non-State actors for malicious cyber activities.¹³⁶\n\nIn 2013, “[a] group of governmental experts from 15 UN Member States¹³⁷ . . . agreed in a consensus report . . . that ‘States must not use non-State actors to commit internationally wrongful acts.’”¹³⁸ In 2015, a group of 20 Member States expanded on its previous report, providing: “States must not use [non-State actors] to commit internationally wrongful acts\n\n129.

Admittedly, the VCT would replace the unreachable effective control test with something more accessible to States, but the VCT lowers the bar too much by enlarging State responsibility to an unprecedented breadth.²³⁷ While Tran attempts to polish the VCT into a workable solution, Tran suggests impractical means to achieve a cheerful, unrealistic end.\n\n229.

(emphasizing that to attribute a non-State actor’s actions to a State, the State must exercise overall control in the course of which the alleged violations took place).",
    "PENN STATE LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 126:3]\n\nUnder the effective control test, the non-State actor’s actions would not be attributable to the State.²⁸² Under the CECT, however, the actions would be legally attributable because the States do not gain immunity if they are not present when the non-State actor clicks the mouse to begin the operation.²⁸³\n\nIn sum, for the CECT, the victim State must show that the accused State: (1) directly technically or tactically enabled the non-State actor to conduct the cyber operation; and (2) exercised overall control over the perpetrators during the cyber operation. By having two parts, one for the operation and one for control, the CECT imposes accurate responsibility²⁸⁴ without overly broadening the status quo.²⁸⁵ If the CECT requires less State involvement or is too broad, then it risks rejection.²⁸⁶\n\n## C. Applying the Cyber Enablement and Control Test to the Hypothetical\n\nFirst, the CECT requires an examination of technical or tactical enablement.²⁸⁷ On the technical level, State B enabled HG to conduct the cyber operation against State A. By creating a zero-day exploit for the SCADA system’s logging function, HG could operate undetected. Yet, this zero-day by itself enables only espionage,²⁸⁸ not damage.²⁸⁹ Thus, this non-damage-enabling exploit, by itself, did not enable the later physical attack. Nevertheless, State B’s transfer of Tartarus, damage-enabling malware, technically enabled HG to execute a damage-inflicting operation because Tartarus included a damage-enabling exploit.²⁹⁰ Simultaneously, State B tactically enabled HG to conduct the operation by transferring the Tartarus malware, the means to permanently damage the power grid.²⁹¹ Therefore, under the CECT’s enablement part, State B technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation.²⁹²\n\n282. See id.\n283. See id.\n284. See Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 70, at 7 (noting that cyber attribution revolves around minimizing uncertainty about the attackers identity).\n285.

For tactical enablement purposes, State B providing the hardware and network access to HG to carry out the attack factors into the control analysis rather than enablement. See Hathaway et al., supra note 153, at 577–78 (voicing concern about control standards that result in a State’s reluctance to aide groups out of concern for being liable for the group’s later ultra vires acts).\n292. The CECT does not require both tactical and technical enablement, but in this case, both were likely satisfied.",
    "2022]\nCYBER ENABLEMENT AND CONTROL\n841\n\nNext, the CECT requires an evaluation of overall control.²⁹³ State B financed, recruited, and equipped the members of HG. From there, State B issued conditional instructions to HG, telling them to act against State A if State A or its citizens threatened the national interests or reputation of State B. Notably, State B did not instruct HG to use Tartarus against State A’s power grid.²⁹⁴ Overall control does not demand such specific instructions;²⁹⁵ instead, the instructions and coordination can be general in nature.²⁹⁶ State B issued implicit targeting instructions to HG when State B gifted HG a custom malware capable of melting State A’s power grid.²⁹⁷\n\nUnder the CECT, State B would bear responsibility for HG’s cyber operation because it technically and tactically enabled the cyber operation while exercising overall control over HG. Therefore, State A would have legally attributed the cyber operation to State B.\n\n## IV. CONCLUSION\n\nWith powerful States lulled into a questionable complacency, unwilling to create an international attribution mechanism or agree upon rules for the world’s newest warfighting domain, cyber-deficient States are left unprotected by international law.²⁹⁸ As a result, victim States must use ill-fitting, existing standards, applied by the ICJ, for attributing cyber operations, which creates State reluctance to attempt such a task.²⁹⁹ For factual attribution, States are held to a reasonableness standard when attributing an operation for the purpose of conducting countermeasures.³⁰⁰ But, States are not authorized to conduct countermeasures against non-State actors, cyber or otherwise.³⁰¹ Thus, bad-faith State actors can use non-State actors to render factual attributions null.³⁰²\n\nWhile victim States can attempt to legally attribute a non-State actor’s cyber operation to a State actor, those victim States must conquer the effective control test, a test formulated in the 1980s for kinetic conflicts.³⁰³ The effective control test’s application to cyber operations leaves a State responsibility gap.³⁰⁴\n\n293.

    "abstract": "Currently, deterrence theory serves as the cyber domain’s primary enforcement mechanism. However, States are developing cyber capabilities at different rates and not all States can deter others from conducting operations against them. In addition, States have not agreed on a set of rules for regulating cyber operations. Consequently, international rules, formulated for kinetic operations, are applied to the cyber domain. These kinetic standards do not appreciate the uniqueness of the cyber domain and therefore, create responsibility gaps for certain cyber operations. For example, attribution for third-party kinetic attacks, and therefore third-party cyber-attacks, are currently governed by International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) effective control test. Many have criticized this test for being too high of a bar and no match for the plausible deniability available to cyber domain actors. Despite these criticisms and the responsibility gap, the ICJ has reaffirmed the viability of the effective J.D. Candidate, The Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Law, 2022. I would like to thank my wife and family for their endless support and the Penn State Law Review editing team for their feedback. 809 PENN STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 126:3] control test and rejected easier-to-satisfy tests. To highlight the responsibility gap, this Comment applies the effective control test to a hypothetical cyber-attack scenario. After highlighting the effective control test's failures, this Comment proposes a two-part test, the Cyber Enablement and Control Test (CECT). The CECT, designed for the cyber domain's intricacies and realities, focuses on a State's enablement of a specific operation and the State's exercise of overall control over the non-State actor conducting the operation. If a State satisfies both parts of the CECT, the non-State actor's operation can be legally attributed to the controlling State. Consequently, the CECT results in the accountability of State puppeteers and cyber-deficient States gain a shield that their lacking cyber capabilities fail to wield.",
