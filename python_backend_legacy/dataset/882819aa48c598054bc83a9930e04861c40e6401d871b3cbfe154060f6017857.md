Introduction\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine.¹ As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”.² Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n1 See e.g. S.

As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”.⁶ Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.⁷\n3 Clark and Landau, *supra* note 1, p. 324.\n4 L. Condorelli and C. Kress, ‘The Rules of Attribution: General Considerations’, in J. Crawford *et al.* (eds.), *The Law of International Responsibility* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010) p. 221. For the issue of attribution regarding another collective entity with international legal personality, *i.e.* IOs, see Articles 6-9 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of International Organizations, as adopted on second reading in 2011, Report of the ILC, 63rd Session, 2011, A/66/100. For the purpose of this article, only attribution of conduct to States will be considered.\n5 The International Law Commission has attempted to justify its preference for the term ‘attribution’ (rather than ‘imputation’): although “[i]n international practice and judicial decisions, the term ‘imputation’ is also used, … the term ‘attribution’ avoids any suggestion that the legal process of connecting conduct to the State is a fiction, or that the conduct in question is ‘really’ that of someone else.” See Commentaries to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), chp.IV.E.2, p. 74, para 12. But for this author, it’s hard to deny attribution is a legal fiction, although a necessary and useful one.\n6 D. Anzilotti, *Cours de droit international* (1929) (Panthéon Assas, Paris, 1999) p. 469, cited from D. Momtaz, ‘State Organs and Entities Enpowered to Exercise Elements of Governmental Authority’, in Crawford *et al.*, *supra* note 4, p. 238.\n7 Condorelli and Kress, *supra* note 4, p. 222.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’,⁸ clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue,⁹ the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.¹⁰\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.”¹¹ In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations,¹² and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.¹³\n8 It is true that technical and legal attribution sometimes also has to be supplemented by ‘political attribution’, meaning intelligence and information analysis in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. See W. Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’, in National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2010) pp. 43–48; N. Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’, 17 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2012) p. 234.\n9 But as Geiβ and Lahmann have pointed out, although the problem of the identification of the actor is primarily a question of fact, there is also a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. See R. Geiβ and H. Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’, in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2014) p. 623.\n10 For the two constituent elements of an internationally wrongful act, the ILC took notice of the fact that the element of attribution has sometimes been described as ‘subjective’ and the element of breach as ‘objective’, but it intentionally avoid such terminology, mainly on the ground that whether there has been a breach of a rule may depend on the intention or knowledge of relevant State organs or agents and in that sense may be ‘subjective’. See ILC Commentaries, supra note 5, pp. 69–70, para. 3.\n11 Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101–102.\n12 See e.g. Tsagourias, supra note 8, pp. 233–243.\n13 See e.g. D. Holis, ‘An E-SOS for Cyberspace’, in 52 Harvard International Law Journal (2011) pp. 397–404.\n43\nZhexiong Huang\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15]\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n14 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n15 A Kees, ‘Responsibility of States for Private Actors’, in R. Wolfrum (ed), *The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008–), online edition, <www.mpepil.com>, visited on 12 April 2014, para.16.\n16 ILC Commentary to Chapter II (Attribution of Conduct to a State), para. 2.</www.mpepil.com>\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States.¹⁹ Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations.²¹ It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.²²\nThe above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards,\n17 Article 55 provides that “[t]hese articles [of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility] do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n18 Holis, supra note 13, pp. 397–399.\n19 Geiß and Lahmann, supra note 9, p. 626.\n20 Ibid., p. 625.\n21 E. Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense’, in 38 Stanford Journal of International Law (2002) pp. 232–234.\n22 L. Blank, ‘International Law and Cyber Threats from Non-State Actors’, in 89 International Legal Studies (2013) p. 416.\nZhxiong Huang\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.²⁴\n23 Similarly, for cyber operations by persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, by organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State, and by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions, they attribution to the State under Articles 5–7 of the Articles on State Responsibility can be easily confirmed.\n24 ICTY, Prosecutor v. Tadić, Case No IT-94-1-A, Judgment, Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, para. 117. This idea has been echoed by the International Court of Justice. For example, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the Court emphasised that States should not be allowed to “escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would be purely fictitious”. See International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Merits, Judgment of 26 February 2007, para. 392.\n46\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”.²⁵ The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case.²⁶ One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.²⁷\n---\n²⁵ *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n²⁶ International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n²⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n47\nZhxiong Huang\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question.²⁸ This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law.²⁹ The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.³⁰\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n28 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again confirmed that, when invoking this ‘effective control’ test, a claimant must establish such control “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations”. Bosnian Genocide case, supra note 24, para. 400 (emphasis added).\n29 Tadić case, supra note 24, para. 116.\n30 Ibid., para. 131.\n48\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.³¹\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly.³² As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.³³\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”.³⁴ In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n31 S. Shackelford, ‘State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem’, in C. Czosseck and K. Podins (eds.), Conference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings 2010 (CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2010) pp. 202, 204.\n32 Kees, supra note 15, para.14.\n33 Bosnian Genocide case, supra note 24, para. 406.\n34 M. Roscini, ‘World Wide Warfare – Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force’, in A. von Bogdandy and R. Wolfrum (eds.), 14 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law (2010) p. 100.\n49\nZhxiong Huang\nthe control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group.³⁵ This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.³⁶\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable.³⁷ For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.³⁸\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n35 Tadić Case, supra note 24, para. 116.\n36 M. Sklerov, ‘Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Which Neglect Their Duty to Prevent’, 201 Military Law Review (2009) pp. 38–39; D. Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’, 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy (2010) pp. 93–96.\n37 V.-J. Proulx, ‘Babysitting Terrorists: Should States Be Strictly Liable for Failing to Prevent Transborder Attacks?’, 23 Berkeley Journal of International Law (2005) pp. 643–653.\n38 Graham, supra note 36, p. 96; Tsagourias, supra note 8, p. 242; B. Michael, ‘Responding to Attacks by Non-State Actors: The Attribution Requirement of Self-Defence’, 16 Australian International Law Journal (2009), pp. 148–151.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”.³⁹ That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory,⁴⁰ has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.⁴¹ The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights.⁴² In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”.⁴³ Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors.⁴⁴ More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n39 Graham, *supra* note 36, p.93.\n40 See T. Koivurova, ‘Due Diligence’, in R. Wolfrum (ed), *The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008–), online edition, <www.mpepil.com>, visited on 28 April 2014. According to Koivurova, although in international law the concept of due diligence remains a general principle of law, many fields of international law (mostly in the field of international environmental protection) have seen the emergence of primary obligations that require States to exercise due diligence, that is, to endeavour to reach the result set out in the obligation. A breach of these obligations consists not of failing to achieve the desired result but failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end.\n41 International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Corfu Channel* case (*The United Kingdom v. Albania*), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, p. 22.\n42 M. Schmitt (ed.), *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2013) p. 26.\n43 *Ibid.*\n44 J. Crawford and S. Olleson, ‘The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility’, in M. Evans (ed.), *International Law*, 3rd edition (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010) p. 454.\n51</www.mpepil.com>\nZhxiong Huang\ndifferent. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State.⁴⁵ In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY.⁴⁶ However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.⁴⁷\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.⁴⁸\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result),⁴⁹ what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.⁵⁰\n⁴⁵ M.

As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n51 Blank, supra note 22, p. 416.\n52 J.

Has this State criminalised such actions? Has this State actively investigated and prosecuted those individuals responsible for such attacks? If the State lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed cyber-attacks has it sought assistance to enable it to do so? And, finally, has this State actively cooperated in the victim State’s investigation and prosecution of those responsible for such attacks? Graham, supra note 36, p. 96.\n54 R.

With the danger of presuming attribution by country of origin in mind, Prof. Duncan Holis has posed this question: “[g]iven that the United States is viewed as the number one source of cyber threats (China is second), what responsibility should the United States bear if an investigative trail ends at a computer in U.S. territory?”⁵⁶\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”.⁵⁷ In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”.⁵⁸ Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”.⁵⁹ But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.⁶⁰\n---\n⁵⁵ E. Tikk, K. Kaska and L.

Introduction\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine. As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”. Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n\nCopyright 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV. Printed in The Netherlands.\nZhxiong Huang\ntion of the machine (e.g., Houston, Estonia, China), or the individual who is actually responsible for the actions”.\nBut in international law, particularly in the law of State responsibility, the term ‘attribution’ is used to denote a legal operation which serves to “establish whether given conduct of a physical person, whether consisting of a positive action or an omission, is to be characterized, from the point of view of international law, as an ‘act of the State’ (or the act of any other entity possessing international legal personality)”. Simply put, attribution denotes the imputation of an act of a physical person to a State, *i.e.* conditions under which acts of individuals will be regarded as those of a State.\nThe legal fiction of attribution deals with a classic problem in international law. As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”. Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’, clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue, the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.” In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations, and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.\n\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15]\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet. In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States. Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations. It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.\nThe above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards,\n\nZhxiong Huang\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility. But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.\n\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”. The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case. One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\n---\n *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question. This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law. The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly. As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”. In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n\nthe control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group. This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable. For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”. That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory, has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights. In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors. More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n\n51</www.mpepil.com>\nZhxiong Huang\ndifferent. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State. In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY. However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result), what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.\n M. Kowalski, ‘Armed Attack, Non-State Actors, and a Quest for the Attribution Standard’, in *30 Polish Yearbook of International Law* (2010) p. 127.\n *Bosnian Genocide* case, *supra* note 24, para. 438.\n *Ibid.*, para. 462.\n According to Anna Oehmichen, although with respect to the events of 9/11, there was a broad consensus that these attacks did qualify as an ‘armed attack’, the abstract question of whether terrorist acts as such constitute an ‘armed attack’ has not been answered in international law. See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S. Silverburg (ed.), *International Law: Contemporary Issues and Future Developments* (Westview Press, Philadelphia, 2011) pp. 455–456.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 40, para. 8.\n E. Vattel, *The Law of Nations or, Principles of the Law of Nature Applied to the Conduct and Affairs and Nations and Sovereigns*, B. Kapossy and R Whatmore (eds.). (Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\n\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n\n53</http:>\nZhxiong Huang\n\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”. In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States.

    "## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations Although the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15] ## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules According to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).": "In principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility ## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context The question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷ Indeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States.¹⁹ Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰ On the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations.²¹ It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.²² The above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards, Zhxiong Huang at least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.: In the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.",
    "## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?": "In view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.²⁴\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”.²⁵ The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case.²⁶ One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.²⁷\n---\n²⁵ *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n²⁶ International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n²⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question.²⁸ This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law.²⁹ The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that: [i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.³⁰ The looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as: it is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining State responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.³¹ ## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly.³² As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case: the ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.³³ In the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”.³⁴ In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards the control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group.³⁵ This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.",
    "## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors ### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility In case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?": "Given the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.³⁶ It should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable.³⁷ For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.³⁸ Although different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility to prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”.³⁹ That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory,⁴⁰ has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.⁴¹ The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights.⁴² In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”.⁴³ Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors.⁴⁴ More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite 51</www.mpepil.com> Zhxiong Huang different. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State.⁴⁵ In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY.⁴⁶ However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.⁴⁷ Insofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.⁴⁸ Another reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result),⁴⁹ what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century: However, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.⁵⁰ ⁴⁵ M. Kowalski, ‘Armed Attack, Non-State Actors, and a Quest for the Attribution Standard’, in *30 Polish Yearbook of International Law* (2010) p. 127.\n⁴⁶ *Bosnian Genocide* case, *supra* note 24, para. 438.\n⁴⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 462.\n⁴⁸ According to Anna Oehmichen, although with respect to the events of 9/11, there was a broad consensus that these attacks did qualify as an ‘armed attack’, the abstract question of whether terrorist acts as such constitute an ‘armed attack’ has not been answered in international law. See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S. Silverburg (ed.), *International Law: Contemporary Issues and Future Developments* (Westview Press, Philadelphia, 2011) pp. 455–456.\n⁴⁹ Koivurova, *supra* note 40, para. 8.\n⁵⁰ E. Vattel, *The Law of Nations or, Principles of the Law of Nature Applied to the Conduct and Affairs and Nations and Sovereigns*, B. Kapossy and R Whatmore (eds.). (Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51 Taken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.",
    "## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?": "It is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 53</http:> Zhxiong Huang Notably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”.⁵⁷ In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.",
    "## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules Today, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play.

Introduction\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine. As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”. Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n\nCopyright 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV. Printed in The Netherlands.\nZhxiong Huang\ntion of the machine (e.g., Houston, Estonia, China), or the individual who is actually responsible for the actions”.\nBut in international law, particularly in the law of State responsibility, the term ‘attribution’ is used to denote a legal operation which serves to “establish whether given conduct of a physical person, whether consisting of a positive action or an omission, is to be characterized, from the point of view of international law, as an ‘act of the State’ (or the act of any other entity possessing international legal personality)”. Simply put, attribution denotes the imputation of an act of a physical person to a State, *i.e.* conditions under which acts of individuals will be regarded as those of a State.\nThe legal fiction of attribution deals with a classic problem in international law. As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”. Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’, clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue, the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.” In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations, and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.\n\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15]\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet. In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States. Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations. It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.\nThe above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards,\n\nZhxiong Huang\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility. But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.\n\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”. The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case. One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\n---\n *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question. This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law. The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly. As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”. In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n\nthe control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group. This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable. For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”. That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory, has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights. In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors. More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n\n51</www.mpepil.com>\nZhxiong Huang\ndifferent. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State. In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY. However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result), what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.\n M. Kowalski, ‘Armed Attack, Non-State Actors, and a Quest for the Attribution Standard’, in *30 Polish Yearbook of International Law* (2010) p. 127.\n *Bosnian Genocide* case, *supra* note 24, para. 438.\n *Ibid.*, para. 462.\n According to Anna Oehmichen, although with respect to the events of 9/11, there was a broad consensus that these attacks did qualify as an ‘armed attack’, the abstract question of whether terrorist acts as such constitute an ‘armed attack’ has not been answered in international law. See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S. Silverburg (ed.), *International Law: Contemporary Issues and Future Developments* (Westview Press, Philadelphia, 2011) pp. 455–456.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 40, para. 8.\n E. Vattel, *The Law of Nations or, Principles of the Law of Nature Applied to the Conduct and Affairs and Nations and Sovereigns*, B. Kapossy and R Whatmore (eds.). (Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\n\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n\n53</http:>\nZhxiong Huang\n\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”. In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”. Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”. But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.\n---\n E. Tikk, K. Kaska and L.

Introduction\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine. As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”. Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n\nCopyright 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV. Printed in The Netherlands.\nZhxiong Huang\ntion of the machine (e.g., Houston, Estonia, China), or the individual who is actually responsible for the actions”.\nBut in international law, particularly in the law of State responsibility, the term ‘attribution’ is used to denote a legal operation which serves to “establish whether given conduct of a physical person, whether consisting of a positive action or an omission, is to be characterized, from the point of view of international law, as an ‘act of the State’ (or the act of any other entity possessing international legal personality)”. Simply put, attribution denotes the imputation of an act of a physical person to a State, *i.e.* conditions under which acts of individuals will be regarded as those of a State.\nThe legal fiction of attribution deals with a classic problem in international law. As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”. Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’, clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue, the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.” In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations, and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.\n\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15]\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet. In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States. Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations. It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.\nThe above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards,\n\nZhxiong Huang\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility. But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.\n\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”. The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case. One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\n---\n *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question. This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law. The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly. As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”. In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n\nthe control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group. This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable. For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”. That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory, has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights. In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors. More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n\n51</www.mpepil.com>\nZhxiong Huang\ndifferent. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State. In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY. However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result), what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.\n M. Kowalski, ‘Armed Attack, Non-State Actors, and a Quest for the Attribution Standard’, in *30 Polish Yearbook of International Law* (2010) p. 127.\n *Bosnian Genocide* case, *supra* note 24, para. 438.\n *Ibid.*, para. 462.\n According to Anna Oehmichen, although with respect to the events of 9/11, there was a broad consensus that these attacks did qualify as an ‘armed attack’, the abstract question of whether terrorist acts as such constitute an ‘armed attack’ has not been answered in international law. See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S. Silverburg (ed.), *International Law: Contemporary Issues and Future Developments* (Westview Press, Philadelphia, 2011) pp. 455–456.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 40, para. 8.\n E. Vattel, *The Law of Nations or, Principles of the Law of Nature Applied to the Conduct and Affairs and Nations and Sovereigns*, B. Kapossy and R Whatmore (eds.). (Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\n\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n\n53</http:>\nZhxiong Huang\n\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”. In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”. Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”. But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.\n---\n E. Tikk, K. Kaska and L.

Introduction\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine.¹ As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”.² Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n1 See e.g. S.

As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”.⁶ Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.⁷\n3 Clark and Landau, *supra* note 1, p. 324.\n4 L. Condorelli and C. Kress, ‘The Rules of Attribution: General Considerations’, in J. Crawford *et al.* (eds.), *The Law of International Responsibility* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010) p. 221. For the issue of attribution regarding another collective entity with international legal personality, *i.e.* IOs, see Articles 6-9 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of International Organizations, as adopted on second reading in 2011, Report of the ILC, 63rd Session, 2011, A/66/100. For the purpose of this article, only attribution of conduct to States will be considered.\n5 The International Law Commission has attempted to justify its preference for the term ‘attribution’ (rather than ‘imputation’): although “[i]n international practice and judicial decisions, the term ‘imputation’ is also used, … the term ‘attribution’ avoids any suggestion that the legal process of connecting conduct to the State is a fiction, or that the conduct in question is ‘really’ that of someone else.” See Commentaries to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), chp.IV.E.2, p. 74, para 12. But for this author, it’s hard to deny attribution is a legal fiction, although a necessary and useful one.\n6 D. Anzilotti, *Cours de droit international* (1929) (Panthéon Assas, Paris, 1999) p. 469, cited from D. Momtaz, ‘State Organs and Entities Enpowered to Exercise Elements of Governmental Authority’, in Crawford *et al.*, *supra* note 4, p. 238.\n7 Condorelli and Kress, *supra* note 4, p. 222.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’,⁸ clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue,⁹ the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.¹⁰\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.”¹¹ In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations,¹² and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.¹³\n8 It is true that technical and legal attribution sometimes also has to be supplemented by ‘political attribution’, meaning intelligence and information analysis in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. See W. Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’, in National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2010) pp. 43–48; N. Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’, 17 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2012) p. 234.\n9 But as Geiβ and Lahmann have pointed out, although the problem of the identification of the actor is primarily a question of fact, there is also a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. See R. Geiβ and H. Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’, in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2014) p. 623.\n10 For the two constituent elements of an internationally wrongful act, the ILC took notice of the fact that the element of attribution has sometimes been described as ‘subjective’ and the element of breach as ‘objective’, but it intentionally avoid such terminology, mainly on the ground that whether there has been a breach of a rule may depend on the intention or knowledge of relevant State organs or agents and in that sense may be ‘subjective’. See ILC Commentaries, supra note 5, pp. 69–70, para. 3.\n11 Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran, (1987) U.S.C.T.R 17, 92, 101–102.\n12 See e.g. Tsagourias, supra note 8, pp. 233–243.\n13 See e.g. D. Holis, ‘An E-SOS for Cyberspace’, in 52 Harvard International Law Journal (2011) pp. 397–404.\n43\nZhexiong Huang\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'), eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”. In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n14 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n15 A Kees, ‘Responsibility of States for Private Actors’, in R. Wolfrum (ed), *The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008–), online edition, <www.mpepil.com>, visited on 12 April 2014, para.16.\n16 ILC Commentary to Chapter II (Attribution of Conduct to a State), para. 2.</www.mpepil.com>\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States.¹⁹ Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations.²¹ It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.²²\nThe above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards,\n17 Article 55 provides that “[t]hese articles [of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility] do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n18 Holis, supra note 13, pp. 397–399.\n19 Geiß and Lahmann, supra note 9, p. 626.\n20 Ibid., p. 625.\n21 E. Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks on Critical National Infrastructure: A Use of Force Invoking the Right of Self-Defense’, in 38 Stanford Journal of International Law (2002) pp. 232–234.\n22 L. Blank, ‘International Law and Cyber Threats from Non-State Actors’, in 89 International Legal Studies (2013) p. 416.\nZhxiong Huang\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.²⁴\n23 Similarly, for cyber operations by persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, by organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State, and by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions, they attribution to the State under Articles 5–7 of the Articles on State Responsibility can be easily confirmed.\n24 ICTY, Prosecutor v. Tadić, Case No IT-94-1-A, Judgment, Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, para. 117. This idea has been echoed by the International Court of Justice. For example, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the Court emphasised that States should not be allowed to “escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would be purely fictitious”. See International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Merits, Judgment of 26 February 2007, para. 392.\n46\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”.²⁵ The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case.²⁶ One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.²⁷\n---\n²⁵ *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n²⁶ International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n²⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n47\nZhxiong Huang\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question.²⁸ This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law.²⁹ The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.³⁰\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n28 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again confirmed that, when invoking this ‘effective control’ test, a claimant must establish such control “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations”. Bosnian Genocide case, supra note 24, para. 400 (emphasis added).\n29 Tadić case, supra note 24, para. 116.\n30 Ibid., para. 131.\n48\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.³¹\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly.³² As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.³³\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”.³⁴ In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n31 S. Shackelford, ‘State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem’, in C. Czosseck and K. Podins (eds.), Conference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings 2010 (CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2010) pp. 202, 204.\n32 Kees, supra note 15, para.14.\n33 Bosnian Genocide case, supra note 24, para. 406.\n34 M. Roscini, ‘World Wide Warfare – Jus ad bellum and the Use of Cyber Force’, in A. von Bogdandy and R. Wolfrum (eds.), 14 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law (2010) p. 100.\n49\nZhxiong Huang\nthe control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group.³⁵ This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.³⁶\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable.³⁷ For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.³⁸\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n35 Tadić Case, supra note 24, para. 116.\n36 M. Sklerov, ‘Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Which Neglect Their Duty to Prevent’, 201 Military Law Review (2009) pp. 38–39; D. Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’, 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy (2010) pp. 93–96.\n37 V.-J. Proulx, ‘Babysitting Terrorists: Should States Be Strictly Liable for Failing to Prevent Transborder Attacks?’, 23 Berkeley Journal of International Law (2005) pp. 643–653.\n38 Graham, supra note 36, p. 96; Tsagourias, supra note 8, p. 242; B. Michael, ‘Responding to Attacks by Non-State Actors: The Attribution Requirement of Self-Defence’, 16 Australian International Law Journal (2009), pp. 148–151.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”.³⁹ That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory,⁴⁰ has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.⁴¹ The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights.⁴² In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”.⁴³ Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors.⁴⁴ More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n39 Graham, *supra* note 36, p.93.\n40 See T. Koivurova, ‘Due Diligence’, in R. Wolfrum (ed), *The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008–), online edition, <www.mpepil.com>, visited on 28 April 2014. According to Koivurova, although in international law the concept of due diligence remains a general principle of law, many fields of international law (mostly in the field of international environmental protection) have seen the emergence of primary obligations that require States to exercise due diligence, that is, to endeavour to reach the result set out in the obligation. A breach of these obligations consists not of failing to achieve the desired result but failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end.\n41 International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Corfu Channel* case (*The United Kingdom v.

To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State.⁴⁵ In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY.⁴⁶ However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.⁴⁷\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.⁴⁸\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result),⁴⁹ what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.⁵⁰\n⁴⁵ M.

See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S.

(Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\n52\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n51 Blank, supra note 22, p. 416.\n52 J. Healey, ‘Beyond Attribution: Seeking National responsibility for cyber attacks’, <http: 022212_acus_natlresponsibilitycyber.pdf=\"\" 403=\"\" files=\"\" images=\"\" publication_pdfs=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\">, visited on 20 February 2014, p. 1.\n53 Typically, a determination of imputed responsibility in the case of cyber attacks requires an assessment of the following questions, which will “greatly facilitate a determination as to whether a state has, in fact, demonstrated through its failure to prevent cyber attacks that it has become a sanctuary state with imputed responsibility for the damage resulting from these attacks”: Has there been a continuous pattern of cyber-attacks originating from the State in issue? Has this State criminalised such actions? Has this State actively investigated and prosecuted those individuals responsible for such attacks? If the State lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed cyber-attacks has it sought assistance to enable it to do so? And, finally, has this State actively cooperated in the victim State’s investigation and prosecution of those responsible for such attacks? Graham, supra note 36, p. 96.\n54 R. Nguyen, ‘Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare’, 101 California Law Review (2013) p. 1105.\n53</http:>\nZhxiong Huang\n178 countries,⁵⁵ most (if not all) of them are innocent. With the danger of presuming attribution by country of origin in mind, Prof. Duncan Holis has posed this question: “[g]iven that the United States is viewed as the number one source of cyber threats (China is second), what responsibility should the United States bear if an investigative trail ends at a computer in U.S. territory?”⁵⁶\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”.⁵⁷ In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”.⁵⁸ Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”.⁵⁹ But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.⁶⁰\n---\n⁵⁵ E. Tikk, K. Kaska and L.

The Idea of Imputed Responsibility 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\n\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine.¹ As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”.² Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca * Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n\nCopyright 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV. Printed in The Netherlands.\nZhxiong Huang tion of the machine (e.g., Houston, Estonia, China), or the individual who is actually responsible for the actions”.³ But in international law, particularly in the law of State responsibility, the term ‘attribution’ is used to denote a legal operation which serves to “establish whether given conduct of a physical person, whether consisting of a positive action or an omission, is to be characterized, from the point of view of international law, as an ‘act of the State’ (or the act of any other entity possessing international legal personality)”.⁴ Simply put, attribution denotes the imputation of an act of a physical person to a State, *i.e.* conditions under which acts of individuals will be regarded as those of a State.\nThe legal fiction of attribution⁵ deals with a classic problem in international law. As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”.⁶ Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.⁷ The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility If, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’,⁸ clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue,⁹ the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.¹⁰ However, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.”¹¹ In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations,¹² and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.¹³ With all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations Although the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15] ## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules According to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility ## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context The question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷ Indeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States.¹⁹ Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰ On the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations.²¹ It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.²² The above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards, Zhxiong Huang at least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.: In the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.²⁴\n\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”.²⁵ The text of Article 8 reads:\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case.²⁶ One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.²⁷\n---\n²⁵ *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n²⁶ International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n²⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question.²⁸ This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law.²⁹ The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that: [i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.³⁰ The looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as: it is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining State responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.³¹ ## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly.³² As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case: the ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.³³ In the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”.³⁴ In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards the control of a hierarchically organised military or paramilitary group.³⁵ This issue is especially relevant in the cyber realm, as most cyber operations are actually launched by “lone-wolf actor”, or loosely organized “like-minded” hacker groups.\n## 4. Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors ### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility In case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.³⁶ It should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable.³⁷ For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.³⁸ Although different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility to prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”.³⁹ That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory,⁴⁰ has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.⁴¹ The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights.⁴² In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”.⁴³ Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors.⁴⁴ More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite 51</www.mpepil.com> Zhxiong Huang different. To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State.⁴⁵ In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY.⁴⁶ However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.⁴⁷ Insofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.⁴⁸ Another reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result),⁴⁹ what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century: However, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.⁵⁰ ⁴⁵ M.

See A. Oehmichen, ‘Force Qua Terrorism: International Law in the Wake of 9/11’, in S.

(Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 2008) Book II, Chapter VI, para. 73.\n\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51 Taken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 53</http:> Zhxiong Huang Notably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”.⁵⁷ In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules Today, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”.⁵⁸ Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”.⁵⁹ But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.⁶⁰ --- ⁵⁵ E. Tikk, K. Kaska and L.

ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations Although the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15] ## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules According to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\n\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\nThe Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility ## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context The question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷ Indeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming. Consequently, there is no consensus on recent major cyber-attacks; quite the contrary, so far even the most publicly endorsed instances of ‘smoking gun’ evidence regarding malicious cyber conduct have been met with reservations and objections by high-profile cyber security analysts – this includes the widely reported ‘undeniable’ proof of China’s direct involvement in malicious cyber activity against the United States.¹⁹ Even worse, the situation will not change in the foreseeable future. The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰ On the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations. Actually, only a few occurrences of State-on-State cyber-attacks have been reported, and these instances have been relatively benign; the vast majority of known attacks are instead from recreational hackers, who are significantly harder to track than State organizations.²¹ It should also be noted that a solo actor, or perhaps a small handful of actors, can pose a devastating threat to a State through a cyber-attack.²² The above mentioned peculiarities of cyber operations have an important bearing on identifying the source of those operations. In terms of attribution standards, Zhxiong Huang at least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.: In the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n\n---\n\n## ## 6.

Introduction\n\nIn recent scholarship on cyber security, the issue of attribution has attracted more and more attention. Yet it should be noted that in the debate on cyber issues, the term ‘attribution’ can be, and has been, understood in different ways. Many authors, when talking about the ‘attribution problem’ in a cyber context, refer to the process of identifying the origin of a cyber operation, i.e. from which machine is a cyber operation launched and who are the persons operating the machine.¹ As can be seen below, attribution of cyber operations in this sense can be extremely complicated, and often involves different issues, as “what has been described as the attribution problem is actually a number of problems rolled together”.² Thus, “[a]ttribution on the Internet can mean the owner of the machine (e.g., the Enron Corporation), the physical loca\n\n* Professor, Wuhan University International Law Institute, China.\n1 See e.g. S.

As Dionisio Anzilotti famously pointed out almost one century ago, “the activity of a State is nothing but the activity of individuals that the law imputes to the State”.⁶ Thus the significance of the process of attribution and its relevance extends far beyond the particular field of international responsibility; in principle, the question of attribution can be raised in relation to any conduct of the State in relation to which a norm of international law attaches any legal significance, for example, the relevant State practice for the purposes of the identification of customary norms, or for all unilateral acts.⁷\n\n3 Clark and Landau, *supra* note 1, p. 324.\n\n4 L. Condorelli and C. Kress, ‘The Rules of Attribution: General Considerations’, in J. Crawford *et al.* (eds.), *The Law of International Responsibility* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010) p. 221. For the issue of attribution regarding another collective entity with international legal personality, *i.e.* IOs, see Articles 6-9 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of International Organizations, as adopted on second reading in 2011, Report of the ILC, 63rd Session, 2011, A/66/100. For the purpose of this article, only attribution of conduct to States will be considered.\n\n5 The International Law Commission has attempted to justify its preference for the term ‘attribution’ (rather than ‘imputation’): although “[i]n international practice and judicial decisions, the term ‘imputation’ is also used, … the term ‘attribution’ avoids any suggestion that the legal process of connecting conduct to the State is a fiction, or that the conduct in question is ‘really’ that of someone else.” See Commentaries to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), chp.IV.E.2, p. 74, para 12.

    "The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\n\nIf, based on the above discussions, attribution can be roughly divided into ‘technical attribution’ and ‘legal attribution’,⁸ clearly, they mean two different things: while the former is mainly a factual as well as technical issue,⁹ the latter is more about legal standard (that is, the criteria for imputing an act to a State). Arguably, technical attribution is a more ‘objective’ process, while legal attribution, by its nature, involves more subjective considerations.¹⁰\n\nHowever, it must be stressed emphatically that these two types of attribution are also closely related, in that technical attribution, which normally precedes legal attribution, is the precondition for imputing the act to a certain State. The following assertion, made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in 1987, shows the relationship between the two processes: “[i]n order to attribute an act to the State, it is necessary to identify with reasonable certainty the actors and their association with the State.”¹¹ In the cyber context, the interplay between technical attribution and legal attribution is particularly real, so much so that it is virtually impossible for any debate on legal attribution of cyber operations to overlook the influence of technical attribution. Thus it is typical for scholars of international law to combine the two types of attribution in their discussions on cyber operations,¹² and some even choose to focus almost exclusively on technical attribution.¹³\n\n8 It is true that technical and legal attribution sometimes also has to be supplemented by ‘political attribution’, meaning intelligence and information analysis in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. See W. Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’, in National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2010) pp. 43–48; N. Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’, 17 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2012) p. 234.\n\n9 But as Geiβ and Lahmann have pointed out, although the problem of the identification of the actor is primarily a question of fact, there is also a legal matter tied to it: the question of the standard of evidence. See R. Geiβ and H. Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’, in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (CCDCOE, Tallinn, 2014) p. 623.\n\n10 For the two constituent elements of an internationally wrongful act, the ILC took notice of the fact that the element of attribution has sometimes been described as ‘subjective’ and the element of breach as ‘objective’, but it intentionally avoid such terminology, mainly on the ground that whether there has been a breach of a rule may depend on the intention or knowledge of relevant State organs or agents and in that sense may be ‘subjective’. See ILC Commentaries, supra note 5, pp. 69–70, para. 3.\n\n11 Yeager v.

    "Zhexiong Huang\n\nWith all this in mind, this article attempts to focus on the legal attribution of cyber operations, especially whether and how existing international rules on attribution can be applied to cyber operations. For this author, it seems that compared to the discussions devoted to the technical peculiarities of attribution in cyberspace, many issues of legal attribution in relation to cyber activities have not yet been fully explored. For that purpose, the article will begin with the attribution rules codified by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n\n## 2. ILC Attribution Rules and Their Application to Cyber Operations\n\nAlthough the importance of attribution extends to almost all fields of international law, the rules on attribution have been codified by the ILC in the law of international responsibility. In the 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts ('Articles on State Responsibility'),[14] eight articles (Articles 4–11) in Chapter II of Part One are devoted to the attribution of conduct to a State. It has been widely accepted that these Articles, as a whole, reflect well-established customary rules of international law, and they are 'general rules' of attribution.[15]\n\n## 2.1. A First Look at ILC Attribution Rules\n\nAccording to the ILC, the general idea of those Articles is that “the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e. as agents of the State”.[16] In line with this general idea, Article 4 attributes conduct of organs of a State to that State, while Articles 5–7 deal with three special situations where attribution is also possible: conduct of persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority (Article 5), conduct of organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State (Article 6), and conduct by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions (Article 7).\n\nIn principle, conduct of private actors will not be attributed to a State, unless it is directed or controlled by the State (Article 8). Articles 9–11 also covers three special situations: conduct of a person or group of persons carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities (Article 9), conduct of an insurrectional or other movement (Article 10), and conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own (Article 11) also shall be considered an act of that State under international law.\n\n14 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc.

    "The Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n\n## 2.2. Questions Raised in the Cyber Context\n\nThe question then is: do those attribution rules, established long before the formation of cyberspace, ‘general’ enough to accommodate the peculiarities of cyber operations? Are special rules (including special standards of attribution which stem from interpretation of rules of international law) needed for cyber operations, as is implicitly allowed under Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility?¹⁷\n\nIndeed, cyber operations have many notable peculiarities. For our purpose here, two features of cyber operations may be particularly relevant. On the one hand, as part of the ‘systematic aspect of the Internet’, sophisticated hackers can easily hide their identity and maintain anonymity through tricks like IP spoofing and botnet.¹⁸ In fact, owing to the very architecture of the Internet, tracking and tracing the origin of cyber operations can be uniquely complex, costly and time-consuming.

The hitherto prevalent assumption that the issue of identification in cyberspace is one that will eventually simply be solved by new technical developments has been eroded by several studies in recent years.²⁰\n\nOn the other hand, as cyberspace is easily accessible to non-State actors including individuals, most cyber-attacks come from individuals, rather than States or State sponsored organisations.

In terms of attribution standards,\n\n17 Article 55 provides that “[t]hese articles [of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility] do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n\n18 Holis, supra note 13, pp. 397–399.\n\n19 Geiß and Lahmann, supra note 9, p. 626.\n\n20 Ibid., p. 625.\n\n21 E.

    "Zhxiong Huang\n\nat least some of the general attribution rules will be applicable in the virtual world of cyberspace, just as they are in the physical world. Thus for example, to the extent that it can be established through technical attribution that a cyber operation has been launched by organs of a State, from the legal point of view, it appears to be rather straightforward that that operation will be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.²³ But in other cases, questions can be raised, e.g.:\n\n1. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors with some level of State involvement, in order for that operation to be attributed to the State, exactly what level of State involvement will be required?\n2. If a cyber operation is launched by private actors without any State involvement, is it possible to attribute that operation to the State from whose territory it is launched, on the ground that the State failed to take measures to prevent the operation?\n3. If a cyber operation is, again, launched by private actors from the territory of a State, but this time the State took the necessary measures to prevent (although without success) the operation at issue, can the international responsibility of that State still be engaged?\n\nIn the following parts of this article, the above questions will be explored in turn, based on different suggested rules or standards for attributing an act to the State.\n\n## 3. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations under Its Control: Effective Control or Overall Control?\n\nIn view of the growing impact of ‘hacktivists’ or ‘patriotic hackers’, the issue of how the cyber operations initiated by such private actors may be attributed to the States is now of increasing importance. While in principle States need not be responsible for acts by private actors, they “are not allowed on the one hand to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.²⁴\n\n23 Similarly, for cyber operations by persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, by organs placed at the disposal of a State by another State, and by organs exceeding authority or contravening instructions, they attribution to the State under Articles 5–7 of the Articles on State Responsibility can be easily confirmed.\n\n24 ICTY, Prosecutor v. Tadić, Case No IT-94-1-A, Judgment, Appeals Chamber, 15 July 1999, para. 117. This idea has been echoed by the International Court of Justice. For example, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the Court emphasised that States should not be allowed to “escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would be purely fictitious”. See International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Merits, Judgment of 26 February 2007, para. 392.\n\n46",
    "The Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n\n## 3.1. Two Competing Standards on State Control\n\nArticle 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility attempts to strike a balance between the two competing requirements in attributing conduct of private actors to the States, as “the rationale behind [Article 8] is to prevent States from escaping international responsibility by having private individuals carry out tasks that may not or should not be performed by State officials”.²⁵ The text of Article 8 reads:\n\n### Article 8 Conduct directed or controlled by a State\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\nWhile the meaning of ‘instructions’ and ‘direction’ in Article 8 is relatively clear, the term ‘control’ leaves much more room for interpretation. In order to attribute an act by private persons to a State under Article 8, what level of control by the State will be needed? This question was not explicitly answered by the ILC, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) first addressed this issue in the 1986 *Nicaragua* case.²⁶ One of the issues in dispute is whether acts of *contras* (the rebels in Nicaragua) could be attributed to the US. The ICJ stated:\n\nThe Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the *contras*, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the *contras* in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the *contras* without the control of the United States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.²⁷\n\n---\n\n²⁵ *Tadić* case, *supra* note 24.\n\n²⁶ International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986.\n\n²⁷ *Ibid.*, para. 115 (emphasis added).\n\n47",
    "Zhxiong Huang\n\nThe effective control requires not only ‘general control’ by the State over a group with a high degree of dependency on it, but also a precise order to commit the acts in question.²⁸ This stringent standard adopted by the ICJ was criticised by the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Tadić case. In determining that the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) was actually controlled by the Yugoslavian army, the Appeals Chamber held that the Nicaragua test was ‘unconvincing’ and inconsistent with the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility, which renders the State responsible for everything that it controls in fact or in law.²⁹ The Appeals Chamber went on to declare that:\n\n[i]n order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group. However, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law.³⁰\n\nThe looser standard of ‘overall control’ was heralded by some commentators, especially in the cyber context. For the supporter of the new approach, they insisted that the overall control standard should be adopted, as:\n\nit is far too easy for governments to hide their information warfare operations under the effective control standard. It should thus be sufficient as matter of international law to prove overall control by a government in a cyber attack, rather than complete control. For example, if the overall control standard were used instead of effective control, it would be possible that Russian or Chinese incitement behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, Georgia, or the United States, if proven, would be sufficient to satisfy State attribution. A comprehensive legal regime in the future could grant Estonia, and other victim nations, adequate reparations for such attacks. But if effective control becomes the dominant paradigm for determining\n\n28 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again confirmed that, when invoking this ‘effective control’ test, a claimant must establish such control “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations”.

    "The Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n\nState responsibility for cyber attacks, even a victim State of a worst-case scenario cyber attack may not receive justice.³¹\n\n## 3.2. Why the Overall Control Standard Should Be Rejected?\n\nThe argument in support of the overall control standard, though it sounds reasonable, cannot withstand careful scrutiny. On the one hand, the ICJ and ICTY were actually using two different standards to deal with different issues (State responsibility and nature of conflict). That is to say, in the field of State responsibility, the test of effective control (rather than overall control) is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the more recent 2007 Bosnian Genocide case (regarding attribution to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the conduct of the Bosnian Serb forces and paramilitary groups), the ICJ again confirmed the standard of effective control.\n\nSeen from another lens, Article 8 is but an exception to the principle of non-attribution of private conduct, and it seems to be more appropriate for this rule to be interpreted narrowly.³² As the ICJ stated in the Bosnian Genocide case:\n\nthe ‘overall control’ test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf. ... the ‘overall control’ test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility.³³\n\nIn the cyber context, the overall control standard is also not legally tenable. As Marco Roscini has pointed out, “it is exactly because of the identification problem linked to cyber activities that the ‘effective control’ test is preferable, as it would prevent states from being frivolously accused of cyber attacks (especially if the victim state claims a right to self-defense against them)”.³⁴ In any case, attribution (and holding a State responsible) is not an end in itself; it is rather a means to an end (to do justice to all).\n\nIt is worthy of mentioning that even in the Tadić case the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed that in relation to isolated individuals or informal groups of individuals, it may be necessary to establish control for each of the acts of the entity which is de facto controlled (i.e. effective control), while the situation is different as regards\n\n31 S.

Imputed Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks by Non-State Actors\n\n### 4.1. The Idea of Imputed Responsibility\n\nIn case when private actors within a State launch cyber operations against another State, can the former State be held responsible for those operations, even if no instruction, direction or control on its part can be invoked under Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility?\n\nGiven the difficulties associated with the traditional requirement to attribute cyber operations to a State, especially the technical difficulties in identifying the source of the attack, the notion of ‘imputed responsibility’ has been proposed, which seeks to impute responsibility to a State for cyber-attacks originating from that State’s territory. In other words, suppose the State concerned fails to take necessary measures to prevent those cyber-attacks, they will be attributed to the State concerned, and responsibility will result on that basis.³⁶\n\nIt should be noted that similar ideas have also been raised in some other fields. For example, Vincent-Joel Proulx has argued that if a State fails to prevent terrorists from launching an attack within its borders, the traditional requirement for international State attribution need not be followed in order to hold the State strictly liable.³⁷ For some authors, “[t]his evolving consensus regarding the establishment of a new standard for imputed state responsibility solidified following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States” – as the Taliban had provided a sanctuary to al Qaeda, the latter’s September 11 actions were imputable to the Taliban government, although there was no indication that it had exercised neither effective nor overall control over al Qaeda.³⁸\n\nAlthough different terms (‘unwilling and unable’, ‘toleration and unwillingness’, ‘sanctuary and support’, etc.) have been used to describe the specific criteria triggering the imputed State responsibility, generally speaking, they would agree that the imputed responsibility “is premised on the existence of an affirmative duty of states\n\n35 Tadić Case, supra note 24, para. 116.\n\n36 M.

    "The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility\n\nto prevent their territories from being used as launching pads for such attacks”.³⁹ That duty, sometimes also understood as the due diligence obligation of a State in relation to activities in its territory,⁴⁰ has been famously formulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case: a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.⁴¹ The logic of this duty seems to be rather straightforward: the principle of sovereign equality entails an obligation of all States to respect the territorial sovereignty of other States, according to which States are required to take appropriate steps to protect those rights.⁴² In the cyber realm, this requirement finds expression in Rule 5 (Control of Cyber Infrastructure) of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), where it provides that “[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”.⁴³ Violation of that obligation may engage the international responsibility of that State.\n\n## 4.2. Why This Idea Is Problematic?\n\nThus at first glance, the idea of imputed responsibility for cyber-attacks by non-State actors appears to be supported by modern international law, particularly the due diligence obligation of all State. Yet it bears emphasising that there are important differences between the imputed responsibility and the responsibility in relation to due diligence obligation. Conceptually, the latter responsibility derives from a primary rule of international law which obliges the State to prevent or to punish certain acts by private actors. In other words, this responsibility arises from the inaction of the State concerned, not the responsibility from the attribution of acts of private actors.⁴⁴ More importantly, the form and level of the two types of responsibility could be quite\n\n39 Graham, *supra* note 36, p.93.\n\n40 See T.

Wolfrum (ed), *The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008–), online edition, <www.mpepil.com>, visited on 28 April 2014. According to Koivurova, although in international law the concept of due diligence remains a general principle of law, many fields of international law (mostly in the field of international environmental protection) have seen the emergence of primary obligations that require States to exercise due diligence, that is, to endeavour to reach the result set out in the obligation. A breach of these obligations consists not of failing to achieve the desired result but failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end.\n\n41 International Court of Justice Reports of Judgments, *Corfu Channel* case (*The United Kingdom v.

To give an example, even for those who support attributing armed attacks by non-State actors to the sanctuary State, they tend to stress that no armed response may be directed against that States on the ground it violated the obligation to prevent the attacks; but this will become possible if the attacks are to be attributed to the State.⁴⁵ In the *Bosnian Genocide* case, the ICJ found that the FRY was responsible under Article 1 of the Convention Against Genocide for failing to use its influence to prevent the VRS from committing atrocities at the town of Srebrenica; this wrongful conduct of the FRY by omission did not require any attribution of VRS conduct to the FRY.⁴⁶ However, the Court declined to award any compensation for that violation, on the ground it was not clear that the FRY’s efforts would have made any difference to the VRS’s action.⁴⁷\n\nInsofar as international response to US military operations after 9/11 is concerned, it is rather an exceptional example, whose ‘precedential effect’ on future events could be seriously doubted.⁴⁸\n\nAnother reason why the notion of imputed responsibility should not be accepted has to do with the controversies regarding the specific contents of the ‘no harm’ obligation in relation to the territory of a State. Since this obligation is one of conduct (not an obligation of result),⁴⁹ what specific acts are required of in order to fulfil the obligation, and to avoid the imputed responsibility? As Vattel had cautioned in the middle 18th century:\n\nHowever, as it is impossible for the best regulated state, or for the most vigilant and absolute sovereign, to model at his pleasure all the actions of his subjects, and to confine them on every occasion to the most exact obedience, it would be unjust to impute to the nation or the sovereign every fault committed by the citizens. We ought not then to say in general, that we have received an injury from a nation, because we have received it from one of its members.⁵⁰\n\n⁴⁵ M.

    "The Attribution Rules in ILC's Articles on State Responsibility\n\nIn the cyber context, this issue is even more complicated, considering the technical challenges for a State to control activities in cyberspace, and the different capacities of individual States to do that. As was observed by Blank, “[t]he notion of unwilling or unable are not necessarily fully defined in the realm of kinetic attacks, and attribution challenges make them much harder to apply in the cyber arena”.51\n\nTaken together, it cannot be argued that a cyber operation should be attributed to a State on the ground that the latter is a sanctuary, although in that case the State should bear responsibility for its inaction.\n\n## 5. Is There a Need for Eliminating the Attribution Requirement?\n\nIt is also worthy of note that there is the argument that “[f]or national security policymakers, knowing ‘who is to blame?’ can be more important than ‘who did it?’”, and that States should be “held responsible for major attacks originating from their territory or conducted by their citizens”.52 This argument bears some resemblance to the notion of imputed responsibility, in that both of them base State responsibility on territorial origin of a cyber operation. However, while additional requirements are included in the notion of imputed responsibility,53 the present one purely focuses on territorial origin, without any consideration for such factors as ‘unwilling and unable’ or ‘sanctuary and support’. Thus it moves one major step forward toward total disregard of the attribution requirement.\n\nBut this step is also a dangerous one. For the reason of space, it will only be briefly discussed here. Besides the technical difficulties in determining the territorial origin of a cyber operation, and the difficulties for States to police their territories in the cyber era, it should be cautioned that in cyberspace territorial point is not only inconclusive but often misleading.54 The DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around\n\n51 Blank, supra note 22, p. 416.\n\n52 J.

Has this State criminalised such actions? Has this State actively investigated and prosecuted those individuals responsible for such attacks? If the State lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed cyber-attacks has it sought assistance to enable it to do so? And, finally, has this State actively cooperated in the victim State’s investigation and prosecution of those responsible for such attacks? Graham, supra note 36, p. 96.\n\n54 R.

    "Zhxiong Huang\n\n178 countries,⁵⁵ most (if not all) of them are innocent. With the danger of presuming attribution by country of origin in mind, Prof. Duncan Holis has posed this question: “[g]iven that the United States is viewed as the number one source of cyber threats (China is second), what responsibility should the United States bear if an investigative trail ends at a computer in U.S. territory?”⁵⁶\n\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual also correctly pointed out that “[t]he place where the act in question takes place, or where the actors involved are located, does not affect the determination of whether State responsibility attaches”.⁵⁷ In view of the widespread influence of the Tallinn Manual, this powerful argument further shows the undesirability of total disregard of attribution requirement.\n\n## 6. In Conclusion: Responsible Attribution Based on ILC Rules\n\nToday, cyber security is a concern common to all States. Without doubt, it is legitimate for victim States to respond to cyber threats effectively, and to hold wrong-doers responsible. In this regard, the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility have a key role to play. As Prof. Nicholas Tsagourias has pointed out, attribution is “crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness”.⁵⁸ Thus, in order to respond to cyber threats effectively, we must do that lawfully.\n\nIt has been shown in this article that the attribution rules in the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility fully apply to cyber operations, and they ensure *responsible attribution*. Understandably, those rules, just like other rules of international law, may restrict the freedom of action of States in deferring cyber threats. As one scholar has stated, “[t]he requirement to attribute an attack before responding is likely to be … a luxury unavailable in the cyber attack era … [and] the requirement…. presents a significant gap in a nation’s ability to defend itself”.⁵⁹ But for the reasons stated above, we have to resist the temptation to (inappropriately) change, or even disregard, the standards of attribution so as to make attribution easier. The stake here is high: in order to ensure that it is not retaliating against an innocent state, a victim-State must correctly attribute an attack to the actual attacker. Thus the concept of state attribution must not be eliminated; it should rather be reinforced and enhanced through increased state cooperation and collaboration.⁶⁰\n\n---\n\n⁵⁵ E. Tikk, K.
