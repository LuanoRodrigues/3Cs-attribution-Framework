Lindsay\n## Abstract\nIs cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction\nIt used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6\nWhile military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21\nAt the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means\nWhat sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black ... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft\nMichael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship,\ndata science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception\nAre cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the\nUniversity of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale\nAlthough cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[\nThere are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and\npolitically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain\nNevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine\nThe Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and\nvulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house\nCYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence\nEven while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM\nalso remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.'^{76} As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'^{77}\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto.^{78} NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program.^{79} Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade.^{80} Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'^{81}\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.'^{82} It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.'^{83} SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services).^{84} SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue.^{85} The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.'^{86} This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake\nThe difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence\noperations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with\ntheir political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency\nto separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself.",

Lindsay ## Abstract Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction It used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft Michael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship, data science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception Are cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale Although cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[ There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain Nevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine The Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and vulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house CYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence Even while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM also remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.' As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto. NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program. Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade. Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.' It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.' SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services). SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue. The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.' This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake The difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with their political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion There is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency to separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself.",

      "## Introduction It used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition."

      "## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'"

Lindsay ## Abstract Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.",
    "## Introduction It used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.": "CYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.",
    "## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'": "Consensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft Michael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship, data science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception Are cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale Although cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[ There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.",
    "## The bureaucratic domain Nevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.": "### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine The Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and vulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house CYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence Even while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM also remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.' As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto. NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program. Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade. Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.' It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.' SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services). SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue. The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.' This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.",
    "## Implications of a category mistake The difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.": "At the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with their political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.",
    "## Conclusion There is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.": "I have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency to separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself."

Lindsay ## Abstract Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction It used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft Michael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship, data science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception Are cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale Although cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[ There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain Nevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine The Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and vulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house CYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence Even while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM also remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.' As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto. NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program. Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade. Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.' It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.' SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services). SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue. The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.' This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake The difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with their political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion There is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency to separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself.",

Lindsay\n## Abstract\nIs cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction\nIt used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6\nWhile military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21\nAt the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means\nWhat sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black ... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft\nMichael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship,\ndata science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception\nAre cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the\nUniversity of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale\nAlthough cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[\nThere are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and\npolitically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain\nNevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine\nThe Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and\nvulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house\nCYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence\nEven while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM\nalso remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.'^{76} As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'^{77}\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto.^{78} NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program.^{79} Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade.^{80} Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'^{81}\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.'^{82} It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.'^{83} SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services).^{84} SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue.^{85} The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.'^{86} This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake\nThe difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence\noperations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with\ntheir political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency\nto separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself."

Lindsay\n## Abstract\nIs cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction\nIt used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6\nWhile military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21\nAt the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means\nWhat sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black ... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft\nMichael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship,\ndata science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception\nAre cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the\nUniversity of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale\nAlthough cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[\nThere are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and\npolitically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain\nNevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine\nThe Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and\nvulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house\nCYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence\nEven while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM\nalso remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.'^{76} As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'^{77}\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto.^{78} NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program.^{79} Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade.^{80} Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'^{81}\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.'^{82} It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.'^{83} SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services).^{84} SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue.^{85} The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.'^{86} This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake\nThe difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence\noperations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with\ntheir political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency\nto separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself."

Lindsay ## Abstract Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n## Introduction It used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n### Secret statecraft Michael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship, data science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception Are cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale Although cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[ There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n## The bureaucratic domain Nevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine The Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and vulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.\nA crowded house CYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n### Operations, not intelligence Even while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM also remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.' As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto. NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program. Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade. Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.' It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.\nIs cyber special?\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.' SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services). SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue. The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.' This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n## Implications of a category mistake The difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence operations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with their political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n## Conclusion There is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency to separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself."

The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6 While military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21 At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\n\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n\n---\n\n## ## Intelligence by other means What sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\n\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n### Digital deception Are cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.\nThe essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n### The problem of scale Although cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n[ There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.",

    "# Cyber conflict vs. Cyber Command: hidden dangers in the American military solution to a large‐scale intelligence problem\n\nJon R. Lindsay\n\n## Abstract\n\nIs cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt used to be common to hear cyber operations described as a cheaper form of strategic bombing or anonymous weapons of mass destruction.1 Thankfully this is changing. The empirical record of cyber conflict, now decades long, is not a good fit for warfighting and deterrence frameworks.2 Instead of catastrophic ‘cyberwar' we instead see interminable intrusions and disinformation campaigns in the ‘gray zone' between peace and war.3 Scholars have also highlighted many logical defects in assumptions about cyber warfare.4 Even the foundational metaphor of ‘cyberspace,' construed as a ‘warfighting domain' akin to the land, sea, air, and space environments, misconstrues computational networks as ‘virtual terrain' that must be controlled or defended.5 Yet if there is an emerging consensus about what cyber conflict is not, there is less agreement about what it is. Indeed, there is no shortage of metaphors available.6\n\nWhile military imagery falls flat,7 better historical analogies can be found in crime,8 piracy,9 espionage,10 surveillance,11 disinformation,12 sabotage,13 covert action,14 proxy conflict,15 subversion,16 and counterintelligence.17 It is possible for any of these activities to have important consequences for international politics, even as -- if not because -- they are all something other than war. Yet they also have something else in common: all rely on deception, subterfuge, or ambiguity to gain a competitive advantage. Whether state‐based or non‐state, motivated by political interest or economic gain, most cyber actors are preoccupied with collecting and protecting secrets, at least to facilitate tactical intrusion if not to obfuscate attribution. In short, cyber operations look a lot like intelligence operations. As political scientist Joshua Rovner points out, ‘The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence contest. Although the technology is different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional spy‐versus‐spy battles.'18 Computer security expert Matthew Monte states similarly that ‘Computer Network Exploitation is but the latest reincarnation of espionage.'19 Indeed, political actors have conducted espionage, subversion, and counterintelligence for millennia.20 Today these same activities can now be conducted with digital means, by a wider range of actors, against a wider range of targets, at historically unprecedented scope and scale.21",
    "At the same time, the idea that cyber conflict is essentially an intelligence contest has received some pushback. There is debate over whether cybersecurity should be described as intelligence, special operations, or something altogether novel. Few would dispute that secrets can be collected through cyberspace, certainly in greater quantity if not quality. Yet some argue that cyber campaigns can accomplish other things besides. The difference in degree between cybersecurity and traditional intelligence or covert action may be so great as to be a difference in kind. Accordingly, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has articulated a new doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' to enable it to ‘defend forward' in renewed great power competition.\n\nCYBERCOM's actual operations -- penetrating adversarial networks for clandestine reconnaissance and discrete influence while protecting friendly networks from the same -- bear more than a passing resemblance to intelligence and counterintelligence activity, albeit at an industrial scale. Yet CYBERCOM has sound institutional and legal reasons to describe its activities as something other than intelligence. CYBERCOM emerged from the U.S. intelligence community, and still relies heavily upon it for technical assistance, but it is a brand-new military unified command with new authorities to conduct independent military operations. Indeed, the United States is in the process of building a major institutional investment on a category mistake. We thus find ourselves in a surreal situation in which the very organization that is pioneering intelligence operations at an unprecedented scale refuses to describe itself as an intelligence organization. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\n\n## Intelligence by other means\n\nWhat sort of thing is ‘intelligence' such that cyber conflict might be an instance of it? It is not very helpful to argue whether CYBERCOM is or is not conducting intelligence if we are unclear about what intelligence is. Most people would agree that cyber campaigns usually fall somewhere between peace and war, but does that make all of them intelligence campaigns? There are many types of unfriendly activities that fall short of war: intelligence, surely, but also crime, propaganda, secret diplomacy, and special operations. Do these all share enough in common -- secrecy, duplicity, deception, subversion, or whatever -- that we should lump them together as intelligence? We should be mindful here of Sartori's admonition against conceptual stretching: in ‘the Hegelian night in which all the cows look black ... eventually the milkman is taken for a cow.'\n\nConsensus definitions for many important concepts like war, strategy, or politics remain elusive, but the concept of intelligence -- comprising a variety of practices that are furtive or transgressive by nature -- is especially fraught. Historically, many intelligence agencies have not only collected secrets but also have conducted covert action and counterintelligence, as well as taken on ancillary activities such as policing and running prisons. In World War II German intelligence (Abwehr) was divided into departments for espionage, subversion, and security. The KGB conducted ‘active measures' and internal security as well as espionage, and the CIA still has a paramilitary wing. The United States does make important legal distinctions between intelligence collection, covert action, and special operations, but this separation only emerged in the twentieth century; many other countries still do not make such bright distinctions. The modern distinctions in the United States government between intelligence collection and covert action, or between (Title 10) military operations and (Title 50) intelligence activities, or between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA), might say more about the institutional context of cybersecurity and intelligence than the actual nature of either one.\n\n### Secret statecraft\n\nMichael Warner, who has served as an official historian with the CIA, NSA, and CYBERCOM, has perhaps done more than anyone to bring some clarity to the murky notion of intelligence. Warner stresses three essential features. First, intelligence traffics in secrecy and deception, which distinguishes it from other information practices with superficially similar methodologies like scholarship,",
    "data science, journalism, or marketing. Intelligence might use clandestine sources or methods to meet publicly known or suspected information requirements. It could also leverage open sources for secret information needs, or conduct activity in the open while the agency remains obscure (i.e. covert or plausibly deniable). Intelligence is more than just deceptive tradecraft, of course. Intelligence management, analysis, and policy interface are just, if not more, important than collection and covert action, but all this internal coordination also tends to be conducted in secret in order to protect sensitive means or ends. Whatever their technical competencies, intelligence agencies are bureaucratic specialists in secrecy.\n\nSecond, this secret activity can provide an information advantage in strategic competition. Intelligence collection (and analysis) can provide policymakers and commanders with threat warnings, assessments of developing trends, targeting opportunities, and feedback on progress. Covert action (including secret diplomacy) can offer options for disruption or persuasion without the political costs of overt bargaining. Counterintelligence (including operations security) attempts to prevent or redirect similar actions by hostile intelligence. Therefore, covert action, influence, and counterintelligence should be considered as essential intelligence practices, even if they are missing from the canonical intelligence cycle, and even if legal institutions distinguish them in practice. The essential difference between collection and influence is simply the direction that information flows through a secret channel. Intelligence organizations specialize in creating and protecting such channels. The information advantages created thereby can help decisionmakers to focus limited resources and avoid dangers. Weak actors can use intelligence to evade stronger competitors and identify their vulnerabilities, while strong actors can use it to conserve and amplify their strength. In short, intelligence enhances efficiency, by lowering the costs and risks of contested policy objectives.\n\nThird, Warner emphasizes that intelligence is sovereign activity, usually but not necessarily conducted by state intelligence agencies. In my opinion, this is the weakest of Warner's criteria. Not only is sovereignty a problematic concept, but also there are many actors other than states (such as firms, insurgencies, and criminal organizations) that can and do use deception to collect information and influence rivals. To quote the title of one of Warner's articles, ‘Intelligence is as intelligence does.' It is perhaps better to understand Warner's third criteria more broadly in terms of statecraft, which encompasses the political, economic, and military activities that any strategically autonomous actor conducts to survive and thrive in a competitive environment. In this sense even Al Qaeda and the Cosa Nostra engage in ‘statecraft' by building up military power, establishing alliances, and engaging in stratagems. They can use intelligence and skullduggery to improve the efficiency of these endeavors; indeed, they must do so to hide from and subvert stronger state security services. All three of Warner's criteria might be summarized compactly by defining intelligence as secret statecraft -- but not just by states.\n\n### Digital deception\n\nAre cyber operations, then, a form of secret statecraft? I believe that they are, first and foremost, because they rely on deception. Just as moles masquerade as trusted comrades, malware masquerades as reliable software. Both operate within the trusted institutions and practices that bind a community together, but they do a little extra on the side. Remote intruders do not, and cannot, use force directly. They can only break things or kill people indirectly by working within an established framework of software protocols to issue legitimate commands to an accessible and vulnerable host. Moreover, the majority of offensive operations in the wild aren't even destructive at all, but rather create reversible digital effects for the sake of espionage, disinformation, or harassment. Malware works by instructing machines to behave in ways that software developers and network operators do not intend. Hackers also use social engineering techniques -- phishing, waterholing, astroturfing, etc. -- to trick gullible humans into revealing credentials, opening doors, or amplifying signals. Likewise, any human spy or saboteur must employ ruses, deception, and confidence games to infiltrate an organization and harm a target.",
    "The essence of deception, in human and technical operations alike, whether by simulation or dissimulation, for offense or defense, is the voluntary but unwitting cooperation of the deceived. A confidence man persuades his marks to act freely (or refrain from acting) against their own interests. Intelligence and cyber campaigns are essentially long cons that need to trick people and machines for an extended period of time to be successful. It is true that many aspects of cyber operations do not depend on deception. The most convincing ruses, after all, are built on the truth. A little lie is hard to spot in a mass of reasonable arguments. Likewise, cyber operations rely on the normal and reliable functioning of information systems, yet they also do a little extra on the side. Hackers exploit common rules and protocols for uncommon purposes. Even a very noisy cyber operation like a denial of service attack relies on tactical deception by using legitimate requests for connection to overwhelm the capacity of a server or communication channel. The deceptive or malicious use of rules is what often makes it possible to add new rules to disable any given attack, once it is understood. Everyday network operations and cyber defense in particular feature a lot of normal, non-deceptive computer usage. Yet even information assurance relies on deceptive tradecraft: encryption and obfuscation disguise sensitive operations and data as meaningless noise, while network surveillance attempts to detect suspicious threat activity without alerting the attacker. As with all forms of intelligence, offense must also play defense to avoid getting caught.\n\nImportantly, sustained deception usually relies on conspiracy. Most intelligence operations depend on intelligence organizations, not just lone spies. Likewise, cyber campaigns require an organizational network of planners, operators, and administrators, not just lone hackers. The more ambitious the deception and sensitive the target, the greater the need for a capable support organization. This is one reason that intelligence agencies in powerful states have important advantages over weaker powers and lone hackers, contrary to popular ideas about the asymmetric advantages of cyberspace.\n\nSecondly, digital deception can provide a competitive advantage. Cyber tools are particularly attractive for intelligence because the associated costs and risks seem so much lower relative to traditional forms of espionage and subversion. Interconnected networks are a bonanza for economic, political, and military espionage. Digital dependencies across organizations and societies create new covert action options, ranging from benign intelligence sharing with allies to more sporting disruption of critical infrastructure. All of these operations work by subverting the same information systems that are designed to enhance legitimate communication and coordination. By stealing data, injecting malicious instructions, or proffering disinformation, cyber operations aim to alter political or economic relationships in favor of one actor at another's expense.\n\nThirdly, state and nonstate actors alike can leverage computational networks for intelligence. To guard against network intrusions, information technology departments have been actively reinverting the art of counterintelligence. Private cybersecurity firms have come up with new concepts like ‘network security monitoring,' ‘active defense,' and ‘threat hunting' to describe best practices, but the essential techniques used to counter digital deceivers would be familiar to any spy. Some of this evolution has occurred naturally within intelligence agencies, for instance the NSA's transition from passive collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT) to active computer network exploitation, or through the migration of intelligence personnel to private security firms like Mandiant or CrowdStrike. Much of cybersecurity in the wild, however, can be interpreted as convergent evolution. The reason that dolphins look like sharks is because they are both marine predators subject to similar selection pressures in similar environments. The functional similarly of their forms results from similar competitive niches rather than any shared inheritance, given that the common genetic ancestor of sharks and dolphins is exceedingly remote. Likewise, cyber criminals, cybersecurity firms, and academic labs respond to many of the same functional imperatives for deception that have long motivated state intelligence agencies. To take just one example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto studies digital surveillance targeting journalists, activists, and scholars; in doing so it has itself taken on many of the trappings of the spy agencies it investigates, to include physical access controls, data restrictions, and regular security audits. Similarly, security researchers at the",
    "University of California San Diego reinvented the counterintelligence wheel to elicit information from scammers so that they could study people who did not want to be studied.\n\nTo sum up, cyber operations use deceptive tradecraft for political statecraft, but not only by states. Cyber exploitation, attack, and defense are digital reincarnations of classic collection, influence, and counterintelligence practice (see Table 1). To be sure, cyber conflict involves countless nonstate actors as agents, intermediaries, and targets, and cyber campaigns unfold at unprecedented scope and scale. Nevertheless, cybersecurity is still intelligence, digitized and supersized.\n\n### The problem of scale\n\nAlthough cybersecurity appears to be intelligence by Michael Warner's criteria, he argues that it has evolved into something other than intelligence: ‘the technology of cyberspace seems to be producing something unexpected: operations and effects that resemble covert actions but are much larger in their scale and reach.' Traditional conspiracies and espionage rings were usually limited in size and scale. The more people involved and the more ambitious their reach, the more likely they were to be detected and rolled up. Since secrecy is necessary to intelligence, the risk of compromise has always been a limiting factor on the scale of intelligence. However, Warner argues, ‘cyberspace seems to have fixed covert action's problem of scale.' He is on to something important. Ubiquitous networked technology appears to make collection and influence cheaper, easier, and less risky. Weaker states and nonstate actors now have opportunities to do things that once required a well-resourced state intelligence agency. Lower operational costs enable actors to dramatically scale up their activities by infiltrating thousands of machines in a single operation or tailoring messages for millions of different users. This also means that many actors previously disinterested in intelligence now have incentives to take notice.\n\nFor similar reasons, political scientists Richard Harknett and Max Smeets also resist the reduction of cybersecurity to intelligence. Instead they emphasize that cyber campaigns ‘take place over time, to achieve a cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage.' They argue that this new potential is determined by the networked structure of cyberspace: ‘The technological nature of the environment and the inherent dynamic that follows from the technology suggests that the opportunities for seeking initiative is exponentially higher in cyberspace across both time and geographical space.' They agree that digital technology has expanded the scope or variety of intelligence activity, but they argue that ‘an expansion in scope of operations has been accompanied by an expansion in scale and, when taken together, is resulting in a difference in kind and not merely degree.'\n\n[Table 1.] New cyber variations on classic intelligence themes.\n\n[",
    "There are two problems with this argument. First is that the modern intelligence enterprise is built on a dramatic technological expansion of possibilities for espionage. The telegraphic and wireless revolutions over a century ago vastly expanded the speed, variety, volume, and vulnerability of all kinds of communications, and thus SIGINT. Complementary innovation in aviation, ships, submarines, satellites, and sensors gave birth to entirely new technical collection disciplines. Through them intelligence scaled up dramatically to reconnoiter and contest the entire planet. The great SIGINT campaigns of the Second World War exemplified cumulative strategic action, as the Allies leveraged persistent and pervasive penetration of enemy networks to provide information advantages to policymakers and commanders. Throughout the Cold War, as Warner has so ably demonstrated, the superpowers spied not only on each other, but also their economic industries and domestic populations. If intelligence mattered at all in this titanic contest, it mattered as a sustained ‘cumulative outcome leading to strategic advantage,' to borrow the words that Harknett and Smeets use to describe the supposedly unique feature of cyber campaigns. It is telling that the central empirical case in their article is the competitive advantage China has allegedly gained through cyber espionage. Of course, the KGB ‘Line X' program attempted something similar during the Cold War, an effort that was breathtaking in scale by the standards of the day. The increases in the scope and scale of intelligence enabled by the internet revolution thus seem very much like a difference in degree rather than kind.\n\nThe second problem is that the economic feature that enables cyber operations at scale -- reduced transaction cost -- is entirely consistent with the political logic of intelligence. The cyber variations of intelligence practice in can indeed be conducted at unprecedented scale at relatively low cost and risk. Malicious operators can build on the same software components developed and communication networks connected for legitimate reasons, with reduced exposure to detection and retaliation. According to Harknett and Smeets, ‘the fundamental nature of cyberspace rests on a structure of interconnectedness and a condition of constant contact. Once recognised, that structural environment requires us to study cyber means not as enablers of war, although they can be, but more critically as the strategic alternative to it.' Yet this simply recapitulates the classic efficiency logic of intelligence. Intelligence has always been parasitic on the existing communication networks or cultural practices of the host society. By stealthily extracting or injecting information into an extant organizational system, a political actor attempts to do a little bit more with a little bit less. War is costly in the extreme, and diplomatic negotiation or coercion can be costly as well. Intelligence and covert action aim to realize some of their benefits without paying all of their costs. This includes using military intelligence reduce the costs of war by fighting a smarter, more limited, or shorter conflict. Cyber operations may make intelligence cheaper and less risky, but the political motivation of secret statecraft has always been the reduction of costs and risks, even as unintended consequences often end up inadvertently increasing them. Digital espionage and disinformation may indeed be much more efficient than reliance on human spies for collection and influence at scale, but human spies themselves are more efficient than reliance on shear mass and raw power to overcome uncertainty. If intelligence provides an information advantage, then cyber operations just provide more information.\n\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the enhanced efficiency of cyber operations with enhanced effectiveness in political competition. Deception cuts both ways in an intelligence contest. Indeed, scale is an important condition that mitigates several dynamics that are often ascribed categorically to the intrinsic nature of cyberspace, but which are actually grounded in the political dynamics of deception. For instance, the so-called attribution problem is hardest when there are many potential culprits and the victim is not willing or able to invest in a thorough investigation. When there are only one or two actors with the requisite capability to pull off an attack, and a mass of damning circumstantial context beyond the tactical cyber forensics, then political attribution is relatively easier. Offense has the advantage, similarly, and deterrence tends to fail, when engineering an intrusion is simpler and the likelihood of costly retaliation is low. Attackers tend to be more circumspect against technically complex and",
    "politically sensitive targets. The variable feasibility of deterrence and the value of continuing interconnectivity combine to drive the intelligence and cyber operations toward the lower end of the conflict spectrum. Finally, classic trade-offs between using and losing intelligence -- described in terms of ‘intelligence gains and losses' in military circles and the ‘vulnerabilities equity problem' in cyber circles -- can also be expected to become more pronounced at scale.\n\nTechnological scale does not differentiate cyber campaigns from intelligence. If anything, scale just makes the comparison that much more apt. Information technology tends amplify the efficiency gains of secret statecraft. The real problem may not be that international relations scholars have failed to understand the novelties of cyberspace, but rather that their discipline has traditionally neglected the role of intelligence in international politics. The increasing scope and scale of intelligence in the twenty first century makes it impossible to ignore it any longer. The recognition that there can be cumulative strategic options short of war should be recognized as part of the growing scholarly interest in secret statecraft in general, not an alternative to it.\n\n## The bureaucratic domain\n\nNevertheless, there may be other reasons to resist describing cybersecurity as an intelligence contest. Warner may be right that the increasing scale of covert activities is overwhelming the ability of traditional intelligence institutions to handle them. Moreover, intelligence agencies in democratic states might be expected to become embroiled in civil liberties controversies as civilian technology firms and other civil society actors become increasingly implicated in intelligence contests (as actors, intermediaries, and targets). Similarly, military organizations can be expected to struggle with integrating intelligence at scale as operations of all types become more dependent on reconnaissance, targeting, and combat assessment. Importantly, these challenges have more to do with the administrative and legal implementation of intelligence than questions about its nature. Finally, if the problems and opportunities inherent in scaling up intelligence do end up encouraging organizational innovation, then it is also reasonable to expect political entrepreneurs to attempt to distinguish themselves from intelligence incumbents. Something like this appears to be happening in the United States.\n\n### Organizational imperatives for offensive doctrine\n\nThe Pentagon now describes cyberspace as a warfighting domain, akin to land, sea, air, and space. The geographical metaphor of military operations ‘in cyberspace' and the ‘cyber domain' lend themselves naturally to talk of shaping, controlling, and dominating ‘virtual terrain.' A 2018 CYBERCOM vision document thus describes cyberspace as ‘a fluid environment of constant contact and shifting terrain.' Operations in this environment can achieve strategic effects without resorting to war: ‘Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.' Cyberspace is a new warfighting domain, and CYBERCOM is compelled to act proactively in it.\n\nSome analysts worry that inappropriate warfighting concepts could be used to justify cyber operations that are unnecessarily assertive and end up becoming strategically destabilizing. Indeed, the territorial conception of a warfighting domain is profoundly misleading for understanding the subversion and safety of a networked computing infrastructure. I have argued above that intelligence concepts provide a better description for actual cyber conflict in the wild. The emergence of cybersecurity as a major concern for military organizations is symptomatic of deeper historical transformation in military labor patterns emphasizing intellectual work over physical fighting. Rather than view ‘cyberspace' as a new ‘virtual territory' for ‘warfighting,' it would be more accurate to view military operations in all the other domains as increasingly dependent on, and",
    "vulnerable to, intelligence exploitation. Yet while military operations are beginning to adopt more intelligence characteristics, CYBERCOM is beginning to look more like other military organizations.\n\nWhy has CYBERCOM so eagerly embraced an idea that rests on contested if not altogether shaky foundations? Sometimes it is helpful to take a step back and ask why that idea is attractive. Strategic language can be instrumental for bureaucratic goals. It may or may not make sense to consider cyberspace as the ‘fifth domain,' coequal with the warfighting environments of established services, with strategic imperatives for ‘defending forward.' What is more certain, however, is that these ideas are invaluable for establishing the authority and autonomy of a brand-new institution like CYBERCOM.\n\nClassic organization theory stresses that bureaucratic organizations seek resources, autonomy, and control, guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity. For military organizations this translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described as ‘the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive capabilities, necessitate authority for independent operations, reduce uncertainty by setting the operational tempo, and are consistent with a warrior ethos. The institution of the U.S. Air Force is an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver victory independently of the other services. The ideology of strategic bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often proved disappointing in practice. A doctrine of independent strategic effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command. The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical skills needed to exploit it.\n\nFrom this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the early Air Force. New ideas about cyber campaigns, and accompanying authorities to carry them out, are supposed to enable CYBERCOM to create meaningful strategic effects. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries. Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, ‘By the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the patchwork pursuit of various cyberspace-related initiatives, neither the Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.' The Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal ruminations, was ‘marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated cyberspace career field.'\n\nQuestions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control, autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to ‘defend forward' in the ‘cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create strategic effects. Proactive campaigning to influence or disrupt the adversary's networks is consistent with the offensive warrior ethos of military institutions. Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment. Expanded authorities for peacetime operations provide some autonomy from other services, as well as the intelligence community. To ‘man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement the new doctrine, finally, CYBERCOM needs plans, budget allocations, and personnel. It is also helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task forces.",
    "A crowded house\n\nCYBERCOM needs to do two things to persuade decisionmakers throughout the Department of Defense and the Executive and Legislative branches to provide the authorities and resources it needs to pursue its preferred course of action. First, CYBERCOM needs to make itself comparable to other services by arguing that it performs familiar categories of military operations -- command, intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, it must also distinguish itself from its former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\n\nCYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019, CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of ‘1,520 military and civilians, plus contractors' together with ‘4,406 Service members and civilians in our Cyber Mission Force.'\n\nThe service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and institutional histories to CYBERCOM. The Air Force articulated an early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were initially split across different branch baronies before being consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals (network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in its ranks, CYBERCOM has strong incentives to articulate common doctrinal concepts to coordinate and control other organizations' resources.\n\nCYBERCOM's divorce from STRATCOM was probably inevitable. Cyber operations can be used to support nuclear deterrence, the primary mission of STRATCOM, for strategic warning, targeting intelligence, and disruption of enemy command and control. But from a strategic perspective, cyber operations are so complementary (opposite) to nuclear deterrence -- one depends on secrecy while the other requires credible communication -- that they do not fit together well. The secrecy and ambiguity of cyber operations tend to undermine their usefulness for coercive signaling. Clandestine intrusions might even undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, since nuclear accidents or miscalculations would be catastrophic, nuclear operations rely on highly centralized command and control, preplanned options, and rigid controls to guard against malfunction or misuse. Yet these same features tend to be too restrictive for responding to most cyber threats, which are concentrated at the low end of the conflict spectrum. A requirement to seek presidential authorization for every cyber operation would impede the ability to respond quickly and proactively to fleeting opportunities in cyberspace. In short, CYBERCOM's offensive and defensive missions were not a good fit with STRATCOM's organizational culture. STRATCOM's job is to control the nation's nuclear deterrent, which is most successful when never used. Yet cyber operations can be and are used frequently in peacetime, in combat, and everywhere in between.\n\n### Operations, not intelligence\n\nEven while CYBERCOM was formally a part of STRATCOM, much of its technical capacity came from the intelligence community. CYBERCOM was extruded from, and still cohabitates today with, the NSA. The leadership of both organizations is still ‘dual hatted,' meaning that General Paul M. Nakasone serves as both Commander of CYBERCOM and Director of the NSA. CYBERCOM",
    "also remains dependent on NSA's technical expertise, particularly for gaining close access to sensitive networks via a unit formerly known as ‘Tailored Access Operations.'^{76} As Nakasone observed in Congressional testimony, ‘The National Security Agency is our most important partner; the strength of this relationship will remain critical to the defense of the nation. The Agency's world-class expertise, technical capabilities, and accesses are crucial to USCYBERCOM's success.'^{77}\n\nIt is easy to take for granted the NSA's prowess in the cyber realm today and assume that its evolution from SIGINT to cyber was inevitable. By turn of the millennium, the NSA had indeed embraced computer network operations with gusto.^{78} NSA even provided technical support for offensive covert actions like Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) targeting the Iranian nuclear program.^{79} Yet while there is an undeniable affinity between the exploitation of computer networks for intelligence and classical SIGINT, one should be careful about jumping immediately to the conclusion that they are one and the same. As Craig Wiener shows in his remarkable dissertation, this innovation was initially resisted within Fort Meade.^{80} Traditional SIGINT collects radio emissions from the ‘midpoint' of a communication network, passively from a distance, without interfering with the target. Cyber operations, by contrast, attack the ‘endpoint' by infiltrating a target network, consuming its bandwidth, rewriting its memory, and manipulating its users, even when the goal is simply to collect intelligence. This sort of close access requires a very different mindset, and distinct technical skills, on the part of operators and administrators. Traditional SIGINT is almost exclusively preoccupied with collection and protection, rather than covert influence, even as the resulting intelligence might be used to support covert action or military operations. In the realm of computer network operations, by contrast, it is a short jump from intelligence collection to covert influence. The same methods useful for getting data out of a target can also be used to inject data into it. As former NSA director General Michael Hayden points out, ‘operationally and technologically cyber espionage is not distinguishable from cyberattack. However, [...]it is distinguishable in law, and it is distinguishable in authority.'^{81}\n\nThe NSA is first and foremost a technical collection agency that prefers to protect its sources and methods so that it can keep on collecting. Even covert action threatens to undermine collection capability. Covert action, moreover, is usually seen as the job of the CIA, tailored for specific targets with a modest scope and covered by a presidential finding (under Title 50). CYBERCOM, by contrast, can conduct cyber operations at scale under specifically military authorizations (under Title 10). The NSA might provide intelligence support to CYBERCOM, but CYBERCOM can conduct its own operational campaigns. It is understandable that the operational impulses that eventually gave rise to CYBERCOM would not sit well in an intelligence agency like the NSA accustomed to quiet collection.\n\nMost CYBERCOM personnel, furthermore, insist that what they are doing is ‘operational' because it creates ‘effects,' no matter how superficially similar it might appear to intelligence activity. When Nakasone describes ‘developing metrics that go beyond those traditionally used in order to capture cyber-unique requirements' he mentions ‘authorities, accesses, capabilities, and intelligence.'^{82} It is telling that the new military command requires sensitive intelligence-like competencies that differ from ‘traditional' military work. Yet in the military worldview, intelligence is a supporting function that assists the operational commander. Commanders use operational forces to create military and political effects, i.e. to deter, deny, degrade, disrupt, or defeat enemy organizations or defend, support, develop, or reassure friendly organizations. Intelligence can enable these efforts via reconnaissance, targeting, and assessment. Some operations may generate intelligence in service of some other more primary military objective. But in general, operations are ‘supported' while intelligence is ‘supporting.' This also means that ‘operations' are more prestigious in most military communities. The creation of CYBERCOM as unified command with the authority to conduct military campaigns thus helps to reinforce a military ethos that holds operations in more prestige than intelligence.",
    "Is cyber special?\n\nIf anything, CYBERCOM is starting to look more like SOCOM than either STRATCOM or the NSA. As Nakasone points out, ‘The new, Service-like authorities and responsibilities that USCYBERCOM gained as result of elevation are similar to those authorized for USSOCOM on behalf of the nation's Special Operations Forces.'^{83} SOCOM has authorities to both conduct military operations (like the other unified commands) and to ‘man, train, and equip' special operations forces (like the military services).^{84} SOCOM incorporates specialized, and traditionally neglected, units from all the services (Army Special Forces, Naval Special Warfare, Air Force Special Operations), in effect acting like a service unto itself. SOCOM's interagency profile and budget share increased dramatically after the September 11^{th}, 2001 Al Qaeda attacks, and it assumed a leading role in the ‘War on Terror.' Comparable resourcing, authority, and prestige would be enviable for any aspiring bureaucracy, especially one seeking to assume a central role in the next national security priority de jour -- cybersecurity.\n\nCYBERCOM is different enough in its technical methods and historical evolution to justify autonomy from SOCOM. The geeks at CYBERCOM would not fit in well with the commando culture at SOCOM. It is also similar enough in its specialized interservice approach to justify a similar level of authority and resourcing. The ‘fifth service' also has a strong affinity for intelligence work. SOCOM units sometimes conduct missions under CIA authority and direction, as in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Some SOCOM personnel also receive CIA training to act as human intelligence case officers. The national intelligence agencies embed a lot of personnel in SOCOM task forces. Conversely, intelligence agencies like CIA also have paramilitary units that conduct various types of special operations. Policymakers have found the SOCOM-intelligence partnership useful for navigating the gray zone between Title 50 and Title 10 authorizations, for better or worse.\n\nFor the same reasons, however, SOCOM offers a cautionary tale for CYBERCOM. The gravitational pull of military culture remains strong in an organization dominated by leadership from SOCOM's elite ‘special mission units.' SOCOM chronically underinvests in ‘indirect action' capabilities for unconventional warfare, information operations, and civil affairs work ‘by, with, and through' local populations; investment favors instead the more glamorous, and more controllable, ‘direct action' capabilities for counterterrorism and hostage rescue.^{85} The former look a lot like intelligence and covert action -- arming and influencing proxy forces, influencing foreign opinion, buying support through economic development, developing clandestine support infrastructure in advance of military operations. The latter employ more traditional military tactics, albeit at a high level of proficiency. Throughout the modern counterterrorism era, ‘special' operations have tended to become, ironically enough, ‘hyper-conventional.'^{86} This in turn gives rise to concerns that the intelligence agencies supporting SOCOM like the NSA and CIA have become more militarized by shifting their focus toward offensive battlefield operations at the expense of more traditional strategic collection and analysis missions.\n\nCYBERCOM enjoys an even cozier relationship with intelligence than SOCOM, not least because it basically performs clandestine reconnaissance and covert influence at an industrial scale, heavily leveraging the NSA's technical expertise. Yet as with SOCOM, military culture and bureaucratic incentives can be expected to nudge CYBERCOM's development and personality away from the quietly ambiguous world of intelligence and toward more intuitive warfighting constructs.\n\n## Implications of a category mistake\n\nThe difficulties of scaling up intelligence in the twenty-first century cannot be exaggerated. The exploitation and protection of global computational networks, largely invented and operated by civil society, are massively complex, interdependent challenges. Any organization, military or intelligence, would find itself hard-pressed to invent new technical processes, organizational constructs, and operational doctrine for industrial scale, indeed planetary scale, intelligence and counterintelligence",
    "operations. Military organizations even have certain comparative advantages over niche intelligence agencies in this regard. Militaries are exceedingly good at creating personnel and procurement specialties, mobilizing people and resources at scale, coordinating distributed logistics, integrating complex operations across multiple stakeholders, all in a turbulent international environment. Indeed, CYBERCOM is to be commended for its impressive achievements in a short span of time. It is highly doubtful that a specialized intelligence agency, governed by legacy oversight laws, could have achieved as much. Nor is it obvious that this would be desirable.\n\nAt the same time, the institutional characteristics that make military organizations so effective at scaling up operations also raise serious concerns when the operations in question are intelligence and covert action. These can be considered alongside the same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.\n\nFirst, intelligence is deception. The essence of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second nature to intelligence professionals, but the subversion of trust stands in stark tension with martial ideals of open and heroic combat, even as stratagem has a long history in war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business. The mismatch between military culture and intelligence practice is also likely to complicate CYBERCOM's efforts to recruit, retain, and manage the unconventional hackers it needs to subvert the most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?\n\nSecond, intelligence is political. Secret statecraft is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political, of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power and credibility in the open. The political logic of intelligence stands in stark tension with the noisy confrontation of battle or the deliberate signaling of deterrence. Intelligence can be used to make war more efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting capabilities, of course, but this sometimes comes at the expense of effectiveness in terms of power and credibility. Increasing military reliance on intelligence capabilities in space and cyberspace is only making these ‘cross domain' tradeoffs more difficult. The tension between deceptive contestation and strategic stability lies at the root of contemporary concerns that CYBERCOM's doctrine of ‘persistent engagement' will lead to inadvertent escalation.\n\nThe relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders, parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort political assessment or oversight of military operations. CYBERCOM will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close relationships with",
    "their political masters while hidden from the harsh light of public politics. As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.\n\nThird, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication for cybersecurity is that ‘cyberspace' as such does not exist. Digital networks are the lifeblood of governance, finance, trade, industry, administration, and political activism in the twenty-first century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks. Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure. Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both offensive collection and influence and defensive counterintelligence, but their economic interests may not always align with public cybersecurity. Civil society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by all this civilian activity, but this poses serious challenges for military culture. Military organizations tend to neglect or only grudgingly perform missions like counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with, and through civilian populations; militaries would rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities. Given that military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil society itself? Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are especially fraught as they become, in effect, military interventions into democratic polities riven by political disagreement.\n\nThe military solution to the intelligence problem tends to minimize and cover up all these challenges. CYBERCOM has been given considerable military autonomy in a politically interdependent environment. The fundamental misconception that ‘cyberspace' is an autonomous warfighting domain requiring constant aggressive action elides the political dynamics of deception -- by, with, and through the digital infrastructure of interdependent societies. Our contemporary tendency to reify things ‘cyber' will probably seem as quaint in the future as ‘horseless carriage' or ‘wireless telegraph' seem today -- digital technology is simply the way that most things get done. To get a sense of just how problematic this is, simply find and replace the word ‘cyberspace' with something like ‘global economy and civil society' in a doctrinal manual like JP 3--12, Cyberspace Operations, e.g. ‘[global economy and civil society] capabilities are integrated into the joint force commander's (JFC's) plans and synchronized with other operations across the range of military operations.' Is this really what CYBERCOM signed up for? And yet this is exactly what it is doing by aggressively scaling up intelligence operations across the entire planet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is no easy solution for the problems of intelligence at scale. Intelligence contests are battles of wits wherein adversaries feign cooperation in ruthless competition. Because all sides of an intelligence contest can employ deception, increasingly via civil society, the results of these contests are often ambiguous, frustrating, and disappointing. Often the only thing that cumulates through an intelligence campaign is friction. Such is the nature of intelligence. Cyber campaigns are sure to be full of friction and disappointment as well.\n\nI have focused here on the American case, but other societies are wrestling with the same challenges, with mixed results. China and Russia have struck very different balances in the relationship between intelligence and civil society; citizens of less authoritarian countries may prefer to follow a different course. My argument has been necessarily speculative given that so much relevant evidence remains classified. If I am right, I expect that documents will reveal that commanders and their lieutenants wield distinctively military tropes instrumentally to consolidate resources and authorities, while the actual conduct of cyber operations by military and intelligence organizations will appear far more similar than not. Yet already we can glean that the American military tendency",
    "to separate strategic ends from operational means is covering over political controversies lurking at the heart of cyber conflict. The irony is that the same secrecy that is intrinsic to the nature of intelligence now enables CYBERCOM to indulge military habits that are antithetical to it.\n\nCYBERCOM's concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defending forward' in the ‘warfighting domain' of ‘cyberspace' have been exceedingly helpful in bureaucratic combat. They make CYBERCOM legible and comprehensible to other military organizations, which will have to make room for it. Yet these organizational imperatives work at cross purposes with the political logic of intelligence. The risks of overzealous offensive operations now include the inadvertent escalation of international rivalries, the politicization of national security organizations, the distortion of democratic discourse, embroilment in criminal law enforcement, and the compromise of legitimate intelligence objectives. All these dangers deserve further research and legal analysis. While the risks they pose may be intrinsic to the large-scale intelligence contests of future, it is far better to be aware of them than not. Policymakers should make mindful choices about whether the risks of institutionalized deception are justified by the ambiguous rewards. In the case of CYBERCOM, however, it seems that the professionalization of deception may be deceiving itself.\n\n## Notes\n\n1. E.g.

    "abstract": "Is cyber conflict more like war, intelligence, or something else? The stakes of this debate are not simply conceptual but institutional. United States Cyber Command emerged from the American intelligence community, but it has strong legal and organizational imperatives to explain its operations in military terms. Even though cyber operations are essentially a digital manifestation of classic intelligence practice, or secret statecraft, CYBERCOM is emphatically not an intelligence organization. This contradiction between the nature of the problem and the bureaucratic solution has the potential to complicate both intelligence and cybersecurity.",
